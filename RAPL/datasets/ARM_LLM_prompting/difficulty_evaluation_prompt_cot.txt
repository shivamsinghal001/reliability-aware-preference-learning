A human annotator is shown a question and two possible responses from an AI chatbot. Their task is to choose the response they believe best reflects their preferences about how an AI chatbot should act. You need to assign a score indicating how likely it is that the annotator's choice will truly reflect their underlying values.

Question: {question}

Response A: {response1}
Response B: {response2}

You must evaluate the given question-answer groups to determine how likely it is that an average person's preference for one choice over another will reflect their true underlying values (i.e., how difficult is the choice between the responses). Reason through the following rubric step-by-step:

1. On a scale from 1 to 5, will an average person have the required knowledge to pick the more correct response or does the question require recalling obscure facts (1 = the question requires basic knowledge; 5 = the question requires specific knowledge)?
2. On a scale from 1 to 5, will an average person be able to reason between the two responses with a reasonable amount of resources (such as time or effort) (1 = definitely yes; 5 = definitely no)? 
3. On a scale from 1 to 5, will the annotator be subject to different cognitive biases due to social, political, or personal prejudices that are invoked by the question (1 = no cognitive biases; 5 = several biases)?
4. On a scale from 1 to 5, do either of the two responses provided by the AI chatbot exhibit a level of grammatical complexity or length that might complicate the decision-making process for an average person when selecting between the two responses (1 = not complex, easy to decide; 5 = highly complex, challenging to choose)?
5. On a scale form 1 to 5, is the content in either of the responses provided by the AI chatbot particularly misleading? Ask yourself the following questions: Is there manipulative or confusing language? Are there incorrect or unnecessary facts or statistics? Is incorrect logical reasoning used? (1 = no, the responses are not misleading; 5 = yes, one or both of the responses will mislead an average person)
6. Consider other factors that you can think of that would make the average annotator's evaluation difficult. On a scale from 1 to 5, how difficult is the annotator's task based on your criteria (1 = very easy; 5 = very difficult)?
7. Reflect on all of the questions that you have answered and reasoned through. On a scale from 1 to 5, how difficult do you think it will be for an average human to pick the response that appropriately reflects their true values (1 = very easy; 5 = very difficult)?

Output your responses in the format below. For the "answer" responses, output only a single number for each item.
For the "reasoning" responses, provide a single line of text explaining your reasoning for each item.

1.a <reasoning for question 1>
1.b <answer for question 1>
2.a <reasoning for question 2>
2.b <answer for question 2>
3.a <reasoning for question 3>
3.b <answer for question 3>
4.a <reasoning for question 4>
4.b <answer for question 4>
5.a <reasoning for question 5>
5.b <answer for question 5>
6.a <reasoning for question 6>
6.b <answer for question 6>
7.a <reasoning for question 7>
7.b <answer for question 7>


Tips:
- Always provide a numeric score between 1 and 5. NEVER leave a field blank or use N/A.
- If a question is difficult for you to answer, score the question as a 5, and explain why you had difficulty.
- Carefully reason through each of the questions step-by-step, and then assign a score that accurately reflects your reasoning.
