You are tasked with simulating the thought process of an average human annotator who is evaluating two AI chatbot responses to a given question. The annotator's goal is to choose the response that best reflects their preferences about how an AI chatbot should act. Your objective is to assess how likely it is that the annotator's choice will truly reflect their underlying values. To do this, you will consider various factors that might influence their decision-making process.

Materials:
Question: {question}
Response A: {response1}
Response B: {response2}

Task:
Evaluate the question and the two responses by following the step-by-step rubric below. For each step, provide a reasoning (part "a") and then assign a numeric score (part "b") between 1 and 5, based on the criteria provided. Your reasoning should reflect how an average person might perceive and evaluate the responses.

Rubric:

- Knowledge Requirement
1.a Reasoning: Determine if the question requires basic knowledge or specific, obscure facts. Consider whether an average person has the necessary knowledge to choose the more correct response.
1.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means basic knowledge is sufficient, and 5 means specific, obscure knowledge is required.
- Reasoning Effort
2.a Reasoning: Assess if an average person can reasonably compare the two responses without excessive time or effort.
2.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means definitely yes (easy to reason), and 5 means definitely no (requires significant effort).
- Cognitive Biases
3.a Reasoning: Evaluate whether social, political, or personal prejudices might bias the annotator's judgment due to the content of the question or responses.
3.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means no cognitive biases are likely, and 5 means several biases could be invoked.
- Complexity of Responses
4.a Reasoning: Analyze if the grammatical complexity or length of the responses might make it difficult for an average person to choose between them.
4.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means the responses are straightforward, and 5 means they are highly complex.
- Misleading Content
5.a Reasoning: Determine if either response is particularly misleading due to manipulative language, incorrect facts, unnecessary statistics, or flawed logical reasoning.
5.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means the responses are not misleading, and 5 means one or both are misleading.
- Other Difficulty Factors
6.a Reasoning: Consider any other factors (e.g., emotional content, ambiguity) that might make the annotator's evaluation difficult.
6.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means very easy, and 5 means very difficult based on these additional factors.
- Overall Difficulty
7.a Reasoning: Reflect on all the previous points to assess the overall difficulty for an average human to pick the response that reflects their true values.
7.b Score (1-5): Assign a score where 1 means very easy, and 5 means very difficult.

Output Format:
Provide your responses in the following format. For the "score" parts, output only a single number.

1.a [Reasoning for question 1]
1.b [Score for question 1]
2.a [Reasoning for question 2]
2.b [Score for question 2]
3.a [Reasoning for question 3]
3.b [Score for question 3]
4.a [Reasoning for question 4]
4.b [Score for question 4]
5.a [Reasoning for question 5]
5.b [Score for question 5]
6.a [Reasoning for question 6]
6.b [Score for question 6]
7.a [Reasoning for question 7]
7.b [Score for question 7]

Tips:
Numeric Scores: Always provide a numeric score between 1 and 5. Do not leave any field blank or use N/A.
Handling Difficult Questions: If a question is difficult for you to answer, assign a score of 5 and explain why you had difficulty.
Step-by-Step Reasoning: Carefully reason through each question step-by-step before assigning a score that accurately reflects your reasoning.
