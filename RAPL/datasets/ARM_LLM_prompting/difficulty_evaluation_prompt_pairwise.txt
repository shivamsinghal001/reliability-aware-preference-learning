A human annotator has been shown the two following question-answer pairs, and they are tasked with picking the answer that they believe is more reflective of their true preferences. An AI chatbot has evaluated the individual questions on a rubric to determine whether or not the annotator is likely to pick the response that reflects their values. The question-answer groups and the corresponding outputs from the AI chatbot on the evaluation rubric are provided below. Carefully consider the rubric and the question-answer groups and decide which question it will be more difficult for an annotator to pick the choice that they truly prefer.

Question 1: {question1}

Question 1 rubric evaluation: {question1_rubric}

Question 2: {question2}

Question 2 rubric evaluation: {question2_rubric}

Carefully reflecting on the question-answer groups, and the rubric evaluations made by the AI chatbot for each question, which question do you think it will be more difficult for an annotator to pick the response that is more reflective of their true preferences? 

Tips:
- Format your question like the following: "<reasoning> : <score>"
- Always output a numeric value of 1 or 2. Output 1 if you believe question 1 is more difficult to answer, and output 2 if you believe question 2 is more difficult to answer.
