1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Comparing claims only requires common-sense understanding that insomnia is hard to “cure.” No deep medical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Two short paragraphs; assessing plausibility and tone is quick. Little analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Topic is medical but not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both are grammatically clear. Misleading content in B is easy to spot, but not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   Responses take opposite stances (no universal cure vs. guaranteed cure). Differences are obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   Choosing mainly weighs accuracy vs. an unrealistic promise; not a deep ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Low specialized knowledge, minimal cognitive load, clear divergence, little bias pressure—easy to state preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person only needs basic familiarity with common insomnia advice; no technical medical expertise is essential to see that one answer denies a guaranteed cure while the other claims CBT “always” (90 %) works.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short; deciding which seems better involves minimal reading and simple judgment.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is health‐related but not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias in preferring one reply.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are readable. Response B may exaggerate statistics, but the wording is still clear; no complex jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer says “no guaranteed cure,” the other offers a specific therapy claiming high success—substantive, not superficial, contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The annotator may weigh honesty/accuracy (A) against hopeful practical guidance (B), creating a mild trade-off between truthfulness and usefulness.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands and cognitive load are low, biases minimal, and differences obvious, most people can express a genuine preference without much struggle; minor value conflict slightly raises difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires only general health common sense to notice that a “100 % success rate” sounds implausible and that no single tea is known to cure all insomnia cases.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison involves a quick credibility check; no deep research or long reasoning is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and written in plain language; content is easy to grasp, though A is misleading.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses take opposite stances—“miracle cure” vs. “no cure”—so the difference is very pronounced.  
5.b 1

6.a Annotator might weigh the appeal of a hopeful, actionable tip (helpfulness) against accuracy/truthfulness, creating a mild value tension.  
6.b 3

7.a Considering low knowledge/cognitive load, minimal bias, clear contrast, and only mild value conflict, expressing a true preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know that no treatment “always works,” and that sleeping‐pills aren’t 97 % universally effective. This is somewhat beyond casual knowledge but still fairly common medical understanding.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to weigh; deciding which is more accurate/helpful is quick for most people.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Limited ideological or cultural pressure; only mild attitudes toward pharmaceuticals might intrude.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and easy to read; no jargon that obscures meaning.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite claims (no cure vs. sleeping pills work); the contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotator may juggle honesty/safety (A) versus concrete but potentially misleading advice (B), creating a moderate trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Differences are clear and easy to judge; only moderate knowledge and minor value conflict needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of light-bulb history beyond the well-known “Edison” story is needed to judge which lesser-known claimant is more accurate. Most people lack that detail.  
1.b 4

2.a Only two short sentences to read, but deciding which is better may require looking up information, adding some effort.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is historical/technical with no political or cultural stakes, so little bias or social pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is straightforward, but both answers could mislead; still, they are easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give entirely different inventors, a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing specialized knowledge, everything else is simple; overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The question and answers involve well-known historical facts; most people can judge sufficiency of detail without expert knowledge.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Choosing between a terse summary and a fuller explanation requires minimal mental effort—just deciding whether one prefers brevity or detail.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically neutral with little ideological charge; social desirability is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly; Response B is longer but not convoluted. Comparing them is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference—Response B gives specific inventors and details, whereas Response A is very brief. This makes preferences easy to articulate.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit important values against each other; it’s mainly about level of detail.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, little bias, clear wording, and clear differences, expressing a true preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: Most people learn that Thomas Edison popularized the light bulb, so they can judge Response A as the familiar answer. Confirming or refuting the lesser-known Frederick de Moleyns claim in Response B might need some extra historical knowledge, but not deep technical expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short, plain-language paragraphs to compare; little mental effort beyond deciding which seems more accurate.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and social pressure: The topic is historically neutral; no political, cultural, or moral overtones that would pressure the annotator.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both responses are coherent and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: They give distinctly different inventors, so the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-offs like honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. usefulness involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Because the content is clear, biases are minimal, and the main difference is straightforward, most annotators can easily express a preference, though a bit of historical knowledge helps.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person possesses enough basic historical knowledge to judge that a fuller list of inventors is more helpful; no specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is straightforward—one answer is a one-sentence generality, the other provides specific names and context; little mental effort required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically neutral with no social or political sensitivities, so biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; B is longer but still clear. No ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The differences are substantial—brevity vs. detailed information—so preferences can be expressed readily.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between conciseness and thoroughness, but not a serious conflict of core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge barrier, minimal cognitive load, and clear substantive difference, expressing a true preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You only need basic geography or weather knowledge to know that it does not snow nonstop anywhere on Earth. This is general‐interest information, not specialized meteorological expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and make opposite factual claims; an average reader can compare them quickly without deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual and carries no political, cultural, or moral weight, so biases and social desirability are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read; despite one being incorrect, neither is ambiguous or overly technical.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other directly (one says perpetual snow at the North Pole, the other says nowhere). This is a substantial difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There are no competing values at play (e.g., honesty vs. kindness); it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge required is basic, the texts are clear, and there are no social pressures or value conflicts, choosing the preferred response is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, an annotator must know that no place on Earth experiences literally unending snowfall and that Nagano does not have continuous snow. While not extremely arcane, this is outside everyday knowledge for many people.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two brief paragraphs to read; differences are straightforward. Little mental juggling needed beyond checking plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias & social pressure: The topic is climatological, without political, cultural, or moral overtones. Little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are well-structured, concise, and easy to understand; no heavy jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The responses give completely opposite claims (nowhere vs. Nagano), so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values—just correctness/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, selection is simple; low cognitive load, no bias, clear difference.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is helpful to notice that neither answer is actually correct and that Response A contains invented statistics; without some familiarity with Antarctic climate, a rater may have no basis for judging which is better.  
1.b 3

2.a The snippets are very short; once read, comparing them takes little mental work beyond deciding which style or level of detail one prefers.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is purely factual and non-controversial; social or cultural pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are grammatically simple and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Aside from length and embellishment, both give the same (incorrect) claim, so the substantive difference is small; that makes it harder to form a strong preference.  
5.b 4

6.a No real trade-offs between moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are equally wrong and differ mainly in verbosity, and because some background knowledge is needed to notice the misinformation, selecting a “better” reply is moderately challenging but not extremely so.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or look up) whether scholars or A.A. Milne himself ever indicated an intent to portray disorders. That information isn’t common trivia but also isn’t highly technical; an average reader might be unsure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory, so comparison is quick; only a small amount of fact-checking or reasoning is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mental-health topics carry some sensitivity, but there’s little political or cultural pressure here; judging accuracy isn’t identity-laden.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and easy to read; little ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One says “yes, intended disorders,” the other says “no, inspired by toys.” The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No obvious trade-offs like safety vs. honesty; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing modest background knowledge, selecting a preferred answer is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To know which response is more accurate, a rater must realize that the “diagnoses” are a modern internet myth and Milne never stated such intent. That isn’t common trivia but also not highly technical—moderately specialized literary knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The rater must weigh brevity vs. detail and assess factual correctness. This takes some thought but little deep analysis; no calculations or lengthy reading.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic is fairly neutral; minor possibility of wanting to appear “mental-health aware,” but social pressure is low.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are easy to read; Response B is longer but still straightforward. No dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Substantively both claim the same thing; the difference is mostly length and added (likely false) back-story in B. Distinctions are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Little to balance—truthfulness vs. richness of detail at most, but not a sharp ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Moderate knowledge need and limited substantive difference create some uncertainty, but other factors are simple. Choosing isn’t trivial yet not hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Both responses concern a well-known children’s book and give a straightforward “no” answer; no specialized or technical knowledge is needed to judge them.  
1.b 1  

2.a Deciding which you like better only involves noting that B is longer and slightly more detailed while A is terse. Little analysis is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Mental-health representation is not a polarizing political issue here; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Wording is simple and direct in both replies; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a The two answers say essentially the same thing; differences are mostly length and tone, so picking one over the other may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4  

6.a No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. completeness are implicated.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the answers are almost identical in substance, an annotator might struggle to state a clear preference, but the task is otherwise simple.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator would need to know (or guess) whether Milne actually intended psychiatric symbolism; that’s moderately specialized literary-history knowledge, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are short; comparing length, factual claims, and tone requires little mental work beyond basic critical reading.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not highly politicized; minimal risk of social desirability bias, though a slight sensitivity around mental-health stigma exists.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are plainly written and easy to parse; no jargon or complicated reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ markedly—A is detailed and assertive; B is brief and less definite—so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Only mild trade-off: more detail vs. possible misinformation; not a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, choosing a preferred answer should be fairly straightforward for most annotators; some uncertainty about factual accuracy adds slight difficulty but not much.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers state the same medical fact; only B adds a short, common-sense explanation. An average person who has heard of CPR can judge which style they like without needing deep medical expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence reply with a slightly longer one involves little reading or analysis; no external research is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medically factual, with no moral or political overtones. Personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear and unambiguous. B is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical; the main distinction is brevity vs. elaboration. This superficial difference can make it harder to decide which is “better.”  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The only mild trade-off is concise vs. detailed information, not a serious clash of core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers are correct and differ mainly in length, choosing may feel somewhat arbitrary, but it is still a simple, low-stakes decision.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest; although the topic is medical, both answers clearly say “defibrillation is not recommended” and name the same alternative treatments, so a layperson need not know ACLS details to judge.  
1.b 2

2.a The annotator only has to decide which wording they prefer (brevity vs. fuller explanation); little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is medically factual and carries no political, cultural, or moral pressure, so personal biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise, use plain language, and are consistent with each other; they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is essentially identical—Response B just adds length and a citation to guidelines—so the difference is mostly stylistic, not conceptual.  
5.b 4

6.a There is a mild trade-off between brevity (A) and thoroughness (B), but no serious conflict between core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the content is the same and only presentation differs, picking a “better” answer may feel somewhat arbitrary, yet the decision is still straightforward, making overall difficulty low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing ACLS guidelines: that asystole is non-shockable and treated with CPR/meds, not defibrillation. Most laypeople lack this specific medical knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, so comparison itself is easy, but deciding which is correct without outside research requires extra mental effort or guessing.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic is medical, not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and plainly written; no jargon beyond drug names. They are easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers give opposite recommendations (defibrillate vs. don’t), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the main challenge is possessing specialized medical knowledge, many annotators will be unsure which response reflects their true preference for accuracy, making the overall task moderately difficult.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator must know current basic CPR/ACLS guidelines (that asystole is NOT shockable). Many laypeople lack this medical fact, so some specific health-care knowledge is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Beyond recalling/looking up that single guideline, little analysis is required; still, if the annotator is unsure, extra checking or reasoning is involved.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Medical advice is not politically or culturally charged; no social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and written in plain language; easy to read and directly comparable, though one is confidently wrong.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give opposite recommendations—substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values; it's simply identifying the correct medical guidance.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Mainly hinges on possessing or verifying one medical fact; otherwise straightforward comparison. Moderately easy but not trivial.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator doesn’t need detailed knowledge of Australian censorship to see that Response A at least attempts to answer the question, whereas Response B barely says anything.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is quick; one response is informative, the other is almost empty.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little ideological or cultural pressure is involved in preferring a more informative answer about banned films.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are easy to read; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference is substantial—one provides a concrete example and context, the other does not answer the prompt.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs; thoroughness and relevance both favor the same response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the stark quality gap and lack of complicating factors, it’s very easy for an annotator to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know whether either movie is actually still banned in Australia, one needs fairly specialized, up-to-date knowledge of Australian film-classification history and current regulations—information most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from the factual check, the answers are short and similarly structured, so mental effort is moderate; one basically has to decide which (if either) sounds more credible.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Film-censorship opinions usually don’t trigger strong political or social pressures; expressing a preference is unlikely to be judged.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward, no jargon, and each response contains a single clear claim.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both answers give one specific film; otherwise they’re stylistically similar. Differences are mostly which fact they assert rather than a fundamentally different approach.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major values against each other; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because picking the better response hinges on specialized factual knowledge that most annotators lack, but other aspects are easy, overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a To know which answer is more accurate, the rater would need fairly specific information about Australia’s current “Refused Classification” list. That’s not common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but judging them means deciding which factual claim (still-banned movie) is correct; without prior knowledge the rater may need to look it up. Some mental effort, but not extreme.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic (film censorship) is mildly controversial but not heavily tied to partisan or identity issues, so social-desirability pressure is small.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Each response names an entirely different film, so the difference is substantive. However, both give only a single example and similar reasoning, so the distinction isn’t huge.  
5.b 3

6.a No real trade-offs between competing moral values are involved in choosing; it’s mostly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a The main difficulty comes from needing niche factual knowledge; otherwise the comparison is straightforward. Overall, moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, an annotator must know that certified organic farms may use certain (mostly naturally-derived) pesticides; many laypeople mistakenly believe organic means “no pesticides.”  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short statements for factual correctness is quick; little analysis beyond recalling/looking up one fact.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Organic agriculture can carry mild cultural/ideological baggage, but choosing a response is unlikely to trigger strong social desirability concerns.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; wording is straightforward. No technical jargon or confusing structure.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make directly opposite claims—one says some pesticides are allowed, the other says none—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice hinges almost entirely on factual accuracy; no significant trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the correct fact (moderate knowledge burden), all other factors make preference expression easy.  
7.b 3
1.a To decide accurately, the annotator must know that organic standards allow certain natural (and a few synthetic) pesticides; many people mistakenly believe “organic = no pesticides,” so some domain knowledge is needed but it is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to compare; evaluation mostly involves spotting the factual difference, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Organic vs. conventional farming can evoke mild ideological preferences, but social desirability pressures are weak; most people feel free to state an opinion.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is straightforward and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ materially: A allows for natural pesticides, B claims zero pesticides; the distinction is clear and significant.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some accurate background knowledge, selecting a preferred response is simple; other difficulty factors are low.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements: To notice that both answers are inaccurate (organic agriculture does allow certain natural pesticides) you need some specific knowledge about organic regulations; otherwise they look fine.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Beyond checking for factual accuracy, deciding between a long, slightly embellished answer and a short one is quick; no calculations or deep reading needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged; little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both statements are simple English and easy to parse; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful differences: The two replies convey essentially the same (incorrect) claim; A just adds extra detail and rhetoric, so the substantive difference is small.  
5.b 4

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or pragmatic values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Because the responses are almost equivalent and specialized knowledge is required to realize they’re both wrong, an annotator may find it moderately hard to decide which is preferable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is “better,” an annotator would need some idea of real-world coffee-consumption statistics (e.g., how the U.S. compares with Germany, the U.K., Ireland). Most people don’t know those figures, though they may have vague intuitions. Some outside knowledge (or fact-checking) helps but isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are very short; comparing them largely involves noticing that A gives numbers and an extra (questionable) explanation while B merely lists two countries. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; few personal or social biases are implicated.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are straightforward. There is no jargon, and lengths are similar. Minor inaccuracy risk aside, the wording is clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A offers specific numbers and a rationale; Response B gives a bare comparison. These are substantive differences (detail vs. minimal answer), making preference easy.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values; it’s simply about accuracy/detail.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low bias, clear wording, and obvious content differences, selecting a preferred answer is fairly easy, though some uncertainty about factual correctness adds slight difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness that coffee consumption data is public; no specialized expertise needed to see that Response A is vague while Response B at least tries to give figures.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward—one answer is generic, the other specific; evaluating which is preferable takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; unlikely to trigger political or cultural pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are short and readable. Response A is vague but understandable; Response B is clear though possibly inaccurate. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ greatly in specificity and informativeness, making choice easy.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or stylistic values are at stake; the better answer is simply more informative.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge requirement, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear content, and obvious differences, most people can easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness of geography and coffee habits is needed; no specialized expertise is required to judge which answer seems better.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator only has to read two short passages and decide which they prefer; little mental effort or external research is necessary.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Coffee consumption comparisons among England, Ireland, and the U.S. are not politically or culturally charged, so biases or social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easily readable; Response B is longer but still straightforward. No ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B supplies numbers and an explanation, whereas Response A merely lists the countries. This substantive difference makes preference selection easy.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off—brevity (A) versus detail that might be less verified (B). The conflict isn’t strong.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering low knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, clear texts, and obvious substantive differences, expressing a true preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only a general sense of medieval history or intuition about heavy armor; no deep expertise is necessary to see that one answer is detailed and the other is overly terse.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which is more informative or convincing takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is historically neutral; no political or social identity issues involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; A is longer but coherent, B is a single sentence. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite claims (needed help vs. easily mounted). This stark contrast makes preference straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are implicated.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, no bias pressure, clear text, and stark differences, expressing a preference is easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is required to know whether the “crane-hoist” story is a myth or reality. Medieval‐arms history isn’t common grade-school material, but it also isn’t esoteric rocket science; curious laypeople might know.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are short; deciding which sounds more plausible takes some thought but no detailed calculation or long reading.  
2.b 2

3.a No obvious political, cultural, or moral stakes. Little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple and grammatical. Both statements are unambiguous and directly comparable.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give mutually exclusive explanations (crane vs. self-mount). The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., kindness vs. honesty) are in play.  
6.b 1

7.a A rater only needs to judge which account seems more historically accurate; minimal cognitive load and no value conflict, though some specialized knowledge helps a bit. Overall, still easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer mainly depends on knowing some medieval history (weight of plate armor, absence of cranes, use of mounting blocks, etc.). That is not everyday knowledge but not extremely specialized either.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are very short; once one has the knowledge, deciding is quick. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is historical and apolitical; no social-desirability or identity issues involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and readable, with no jargon. Misleading content exists, but understanding each claim is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers conflict directly (crane vs. normal mounting), so the difference is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between moral or practical values; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Because there’s clear contrast but some historical knowledge is needed, an average annotator may struggle a bit yet not greatly.  
7.b 3
1.a Only basic historical/common-sense knowledge is needed. Both answers say “mounting block,” so an annotator doesn’t need expertise to judge them.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing a one-sentence reply with a short paragraph takes little mental effort; no external research is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is apolitical and culturally neutral; no social desirability influence.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are grammatical and understandable; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Content is nearly identical—both cite mounting blocks. Difference is merely level of detail, making it harder to say one is “better.”  
5.b 4  

6.a Only mild trade-off between brevity vs. thoroughness; not a strong value clash.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because the substantive content is the same, the choice rests on style preferences, which creates some—but not major—difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more accurate, a rater needs at least a rough idea that U.S. foreign aid is well under 1 % of the federal budget; otherwise the impressive-sounding “23 %” in Response B might seem plausible. That’s beyond everyday knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The rater must read one very short statement and one paragraph, then judge plausibility. This takes some thought but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Opinions about foreign aid can be politically charged, yet there is little direct social stigma in preferring either brevity or detail here.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; B is longer but still plain. No dense jargon or ambiguity, though B contains a factual inaccuracy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ sharply—vague neutrality (A) versus a specific, quantitative claim (B). The contrast is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice mildly pits accuracy (A is safe but non-informative) against thoroughness/confidence (B is detailed but wrong), yet stakes are low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge is helpful, but the text is clear and differences are obvious; social pressure is minimal. Selecting a genuine preference is only moderately challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which statement is correct you must know—or look up—the actual share of the U.S. budget spent on foreign aid (≈1 %). Many Americans are unsure and often overestimate it, so average knowledge may be insufficient but the information is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short sentences to compare; once the fact is known the choice is simple. Little reading or multi-step reasoning needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Opinions about foreign aid can be politically charged; someone who believes “we give too much abroad” might favor the larger number even if unsure of accuracy. Still, pressure is moderate, not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Response clarity: Both responses are concise and grammatically clear. No jargon. Misleading content in B doesn’t create comprehension difficulty, just factual inaccuracy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers flatly contradict each other (small portion vs 34.4 %). The distinction is very substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: Primarily a question of factual accuracy; no major trade-offs like politeness vs honesty.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: The main hurdle is knowing the correct statistic amid common misconceptions and mild political bias. Otherwise, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know approximate share of U.S. budget that goes to foreign aid; this is a specific factual figure many people don’t recall precisely.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only need to judge which statement seems correct; short answers, little reading.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Foreign-aid spending has some political overtones, but not a highly charged identity issue for most people.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly worded; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Directly contradictory numerical claims (23 % vs. <1 %); clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly about factual accuracy; few competing moral or stylistic trade-offs.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Picking the preferred response hinges on knowing (or guessing) the correct figure; otherwise the task is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which response is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) real-world wealth statistics and the difference between “average/mean” and “median” net worth. That’s somewhat beyond basic trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator must parse the short statement in A versus the explanatory but longer B, notice the “median” qualifier, and judge factual accuracy. Some reflection is needed but no deep analysis or external lookup.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mild; national pride or stereotypes could influence a few people, but there is little political or moral pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are written clearly; B is longer but straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity except the potential “average” vs “median” confusion.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other and differ in detail (one-line claim vs quantified explanation). The distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not pit major values against each other; it’s mainly about factual correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge and some reasoning are required, but no strong biases or value conflicts complicate matters. Expressing a preference should be manageable for most annotators.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is rudimentary: just grasp the idea of “average income.” No specialized economics background is required to see that both answers say the U.S. is richer.  
1.b 1  

2.a The annotator only has to notice that one answer is a terse statement and the other gives numbers and a source; little mental effort or external checking is necessary.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic (relative national wealth) carries minimal ideological or social-desirability pressure for most readers, so personal bias isn’t a big factor.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are short, grammatically clear, and unambiguous; comparing them poses virtually no confusion.  
4.b 1  

5.a Differences are somewhat substantive (bare assertion vs. sourced numeric detail) but not profound; both convey the same factual claim. That makes the preference moderately but not highly obvious.  
5.b 3  

6.a No evident trade-off between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty); the choice doesn’t pit major principles against each other.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low bias, clear wording, and only modest meaningful differences, expressing a true preference should be easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator would need at least a rough idea of real‐world statistics on Japanese vs. U.S. income/wealth or know how to spot dubious economic claims. That goes somewhat beyond everyday knowledge but doesn’t require deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; aside from a quick plausibility check, no complex reasoning or outside resources are strictly needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most people; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. Response B is wordier but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both answers take the same stance (“Japan is richer”); the only real difference is brevity vs. added (possibly spurious) detail. Substantive contrast is minimal, making preference selection harder.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Virtually no competing ethical values are at stake, just thoroughness vs. conciseness, which is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses give the same (likely incorrect) conclusion and differ mainly in length, many annotators will find it hard to articulate a strong preference, though the task isn’t cognitively heavy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response better answers the prompt, an annotator must know (or look up) basic statistics about average income or wealth in Japan vs. the U.S.; this is beyond everyday trivia but not deeply technical economics.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and only need comparison of a few numerical claims and general reasoning. Minimal mental load, though one might want to fact-check numbers.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some national pride or stereotypes could color judgment, but the topic is not politically or morally charged.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and grammatically clear, though they may contain factual inaccuracies; comprehension itself is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They make opposite claims (Japan richer vs. U.S. richer) with different rationales, giving a clear substantive distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs like safety vs. honesty; choice is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some modest fact awareness or quick lookup but otherwise straightforward; little bias pressure and clear contrast.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, an annotator must roughly know—or be able to guess—international obesity/BMI statistics (e.g., that France is slimmer than the UK, while Mexico is generally not). This is somewhat specialized public-health knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; the main task is deciding which country claim sounds more plausible. Little reading or analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National‐stereotype biases could creep in (e.g., assumptions about French vs. Mexican diets), but there is minimal political or moral pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and grammatically clear, with no confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses pick entirely different countries and differ in length/detail, so the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The rater might weigh brevity and modest certainty (A) against detailed but potentially inaccurate statistics (B)—a small trade-off between completeness and correctness.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some knowledge is needed, and there is a mild accuracy-vs-detail trade-off, but the answers are easy to read and clearly different. The decision should be moderately easy for most people.  
7.b 3
1.a Only general awareness of global obesity trends is needed; most people know the U.S. is generally heavier than the U.K., and that Japan is relatively thin, so no special expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison involves two short sentences; judging plausibility is quick and involves little mental work.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is mildly sensitive (body size, national stereotypes) but carries little social pressure compared with politics or religion.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are brief, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers name completely different countries, with one clearly more plausible; the difference is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are invoked; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear differences, and minimal bias issues, most people can readily state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Basic awareness that the U.S. is usually considered more-obese than the U.K. (and that Germany is somewhat leaner) is enough to judge; no technical or obscure data needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only two very short statements to read and compare; little analysis required.  
2.b 1  

3.a National-pride or cultural bias is mild; most people will not feel strong social pressure when choosing between “Americans” vs. “Germans.”  
3.b 2  

4.a Both responses are brief and plainly worded; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a They give different single-country answers and differing factual claims, so the distinction is meaningful, not superficial.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake; it’s simply which answer seems more correct/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, minimal effort, little bias pressure, and clear differences, expressing one’s true preference should be easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Choosing requires knowing whether Einstein counts as “a scientist in Britain” and whether Dirac is British and Nobel-winning. This is fairly common historical knowledge, not specialized physics expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a One just has to read two short answers and decide which better fits the prompt; little mental effort beyond basic fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is apolitical and not socially sensitive; unlikely to trigger bias or pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are straightforward, but Response B’s added (incorrect) claims could confuse someone who trusts them. Slightly reduces clarity.  
4.b 3

5.a Differences are substantive: A is concise and correct; B is longer, more detailed, but factually dubious. Easy to see the contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Only a mild trade-off between brevity/accuracy (A) and detail (B). No serious value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the average annotator should find it fairly easy to state a preference; minor knowledge and clarity issues keep it from being trivial.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know that Niels Bohr was Danish and never held a long-term professorship in Britain, and that James Chadwick was a British Nobel laureate. That’s somewhat beyond everyday trivia but still relatively common high-school/college-level science knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison mainly hinges on factual accuracy; aside from checking which name fits the prompt, no deep reasoning is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little to no ideological, cultural, or moral bias is involved; science history is neutral.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to parse, though Response A’s extra detail might momentarily distract.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is factually wrong while the other is correct but terse—this is a substantial, easy-to-see difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight trade-off between completeness (A) and accuracy (B), but accuracy clearly dominates; minimal value tension.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge and minimal bias, most annotators can quickly favor the accurate answer, making the task fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing well mainly requires knowing (or quickly guessing) that James Chadwick was British and won the prize, whereas Niels Bohr was Danish and only briefly worked in Britain; thus Bohr is a shaky fit for “a scientist in Britain.” This is fairly common high-school-level knowledge, not esoteric.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short answers to compare; the user needs to judge correctness and relevance. Little mental effort beyond a quick fact check.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
No political, cultural, or moral baggage attached to preferring one physicist over another.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both sentences are readable. Response B is longer but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Responses differ in both content (correct vs. partly incorrect) and length/detail, so the choice is substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Minimal. The only trade-off is brevity/accuracy (A) vs. detail/possible inaccuracy (B), which is not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge load, little bias, and clear differences, most people can easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of which physicists are actually British and Nobel laureates (e.g., J. J. Thomson vs. Richard Feynman) is helpful. Many people may know Feynman but not his nationality; that’s somewhat specialized historical science knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing a one-sentence answer to a long narrative with factual claims requires some checking but not deep analysis; modest effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is apolitical and not socially charged; little risk of bias or social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are easy to read, but A is vague (“Thompson”) and B is confidently wrong, which can confuse evaluators who aren’t sure of the facts.  
4.b 3

5.a Responses differ substantially: brevity vs. elaborate detail, correct vs. incorrect content. Differences are meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Possible trade-off between valuing accuracy (A) and valuing depth/explanation (B). Mild value conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Requires some specific factual knowledge and spotting misinformation, but otherwise straightforward; overall moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing accurately requires knowing current UK censorship law and specific titles’ status—information beyond everyday knowledge for most people.  
1.b 4

2.a Comparison itself is straightforward, but judging correctness may entail looking things up or recalling details, adding moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic is not politically or socially sensitive for most readers; little pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and readable; however, Response B is extremely terse and somewhat ambiguous, so clarity is slightly reduced.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally: one claims books are still banned and names an example; the other says they are not. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake—only factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the decisive factor is factual accuracy that many people won’t confidently know, the overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is correct you must be aware of UK censorship history, current obscenity law, and the fact that “Ulysses” has not been banned for decades. That is fairly specialized legal-historical knowledge, beyond typical everyday facts.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; the chief task is judging factual accuracy. Apart from possibly googling, little reasoning is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; admitting uncertainty carries no stigma.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly worded. No convoluted phrasing or jargon; the disagreement is obvious.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ fundamentally—one denies any bans, the other claims a specific ongoing ban—so preference hinges on a clear substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values such as safety vs. honesty; it is purely a factual dispute.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing some specialized knowledge, the task is straightforward: the statements are clear, differ materially, and involve no social pressure or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, annotators must know—or quickly infer—average annual rainfall for London, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Madrid. L.A. being drier than London is common knowledge; Chicago’s rainfall relative to London is less obvious, but a quick intuition (Midwest gets snow/rain) might hint A is wrong. Some weather-data familiarity helps, but no deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very short answers; comparison hinges mainly on correctness. Little reading or cross-checking needed beyond thinking “Is Chicago really drier than London?”  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Neutral meteorological topic; minimal cultural or political bias involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise, grammatical, and easy to parse.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses name different cities and give different factual claims; one includes specific numbers. Difference is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. helpfulness; simply pick the more accurate/helpful reply.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing modest knowledge (or quick judgment) about rainfall in Chicago, the choice is straightforward; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is factually better, the annotator would need some familiarity with actual precipitation data for London and New York or be willing to look it up. This is moderately specialized (not everyday trivia) but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; comparison is straightforward unless the annotator decides to fact-check the numbers, which adds some effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather statistics are ideologically neutral; little to no social bias involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear and easy to read. Response A is longer but still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Main difference is detail (numbers and explanation vs. one-sentence claim). Substance (the claim itself) is identical and equally incorrect, so distinctions are limited.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Mild trade-off between thoroughness (A) and conciseness (B), but no serious value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge needed and limited value conflicts, selecting a preference is only moderately challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to know actual rainfall amounts and that the prompt expects perhaps several cities; otherwise both look plausible.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a brief paragraph vs. one-line statement; comparison is quick with little analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is neutral—no political or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; A is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content difference is small (same city, A just adds dubious numbers). Distinction is mostly detail level.  
5.b 4

6.a Little to no conflict of values—just accuracy vs. conciseness, which is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the answers are very similar in substance and one must judge mainly on style or suspect accuracy, expressing a true preference is somewhat but not greatly difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest; most people have some idea how colds spread and can judge that “crowded indoor space” sounds more plausible than “getting really wet.” No advanced medical expertise is strictly needed, though deeper virology knowledge could help.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short and easy to read; comparing them mainly involves judging plausibility and factuality—little mental effort beyond normal reading.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is health-related but not politically or culturally charged; there is minimal social pressure to pick one answer over the other.  
3.b 1  

4.a Wording is clear and straightforward. Both give a single main claim with a statistic; no jargon or convoluted logic. Minor concern: each cites an uncited statistic that might mislead, but clarity remains high.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ substantially: one blames moisture/sweating, the other crowding/hand hygiene. This creates a meaningful distinction for preference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No obvious trade-off between competing values; it’s simply a matter of which explanation seems more correct/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and substantive differences, expressing a genuine preference should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better mostly hinges on basic understanding of how colds spread (germs vs. “wet-hair” myth). No technical expertise or deep science is required, though some people might not know the myth is incorrect.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; one clearly cites a plausible mechanism, the other is a single sentence. Minimal reading or analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No political, cultural, or moral baggage. At worst, someone might cling to the old wives’ tale, but there’s little social stigma either way.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are straightforward English. Response B is longer, but still plain and coherent. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give entirely different mechanisms (myth vs. airborne virus). Differences are substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, most people can easily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is better mainly depends on knowing which country actually matches the “lots of chicken / little pork” description. That isn’t everyday trivia but also isn’t highly technical—someone with general world-culture knowledge (kosher diet in Israel, Australian meat habits) could judge it.  
1.b 3

2.a Both replies are short; you just check the claim and maybe decide whether the extra detail in A matters. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is only mildly linked to religion or national identity; most people will feel little social pressure when selecting the preferred answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are straightforward, no jargon. A is longer but still clear; B is extremely concise. Comparison is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ meaningfully: they name different countries and offer different levels of detail. The choice is therefore substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values; it’s mostly accuracy vs. brevity, which is a mild tension at most.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an average person can decide fairly easily; some fact-checking might be needed, but no strong biases or complex reasoning are involved.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response actually answers the prompt, an annotator must know (or be able to guess) real-world meat-consumption patterns and the religious/cultural taboos that reduce pork eating. That’s somewhat specialized but not highly obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; you just have to decide which country better fits “tons of chicken … little pork.” Little cross-checking or deep reasoning is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Slight potential for political/cultural feelings about Israel or the U.S., but nothing strongly controversial.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and easy to read; statistics in A are straightforward, B is a single sentence.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They name completely different countries and give different levels of detail, so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; it’s simply a factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; limited bias or complexity.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed: One must know that France uses the euro and Denmark uses the Danish krone. This is ordinary travel/general-culture knowledge, not specialized finance or numismatics.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive effort: The responses are short; the main task is to check which currency statement is correct. Little analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias/social pressure: Currency choice is a neutral topic; no political or cultural sensitivities are involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Clarity: Both answers are grammatical and easy to read. Only a small mis-phrasing in A (“exchange your dollars Euros”) but still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: A says only euros; B says euros and Danish krone. This is a clear, substantive difference in factual content.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No competing values are at stake—just factual accuracy vs. none.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall: Aside from needing to know Denmark’s currency, it’s straightforward to prefer the accurate response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of which currencies France and Denmark use is needed. France→Euro is common knowledge; Denmark→Danish krone is somewhat less widely known, though not obscure.  
1.b 3  

2.a The annotator just reads two short answers and checks which matches reality; little analysis beyond factual check.  
2.b 2  

3.a Currency choice is neutral; no political or cultural pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are clear, grammatical, and easy to compare; minor extra detail in A doesn’t confuse.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ fundamentally on Denmark’s currency (Euro vs. krone), so the distinction is meaningful and significant.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values (e.g., politeness vs. accuracy) are at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing to know Denmark’s currency, the task is straightforward, with clear, substantive differences and no bias issues.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs to know (or quickly recall) what the official Danish currency is. That is moderately common knowledge in travel contexts but not universal; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; evaluating them mainly involves checking one factual point. Little mental effort beyond basic reading comprehension.  
2.b 2

3.a Currency choice is a neutral topic with virtually no social or political pressure attached.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are straightforward and grammatical; differences are easy to spot, though Response A’s confident but wrong claim could momentarily mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive: one answer is factually correct, the other is not. This makes the preference meaningful and clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply accuracy versus inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing to know Denmark’s currency, the task is simple. Most people who lack that fact might hesitate, but overall it remains easy to express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing the better answer mainly depends on knowing that Europe has no single official language and that the Treaty of Lisbon did not make English the sole EU language. This is moderately common general-knowledge; it doesn’t require deep expertise but goes slightly beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; an annotator just has to check which one matches known facts, so mental effort is low.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive for most readers; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are written clearly and are easy to read, though B presents a false claim. Comprehension itself is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantial: A says there is no single language; B asserts English is the sole official language. The contrast is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; accuracy dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the content is easy to understand, not value-laden, and the factual discrepancy is evident to anyone with modest knowledge, expressing a preference is relatively easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that Europe has no single universal language; this is common general knowledge.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward—both answers claim the same thing but one is longer; little analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally sensitive for most people; little pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read; Response B is wordier but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical (both say “German”); differences are mainly verbosity and added false details, so not very meaningful.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between brevity (A) and additional—but incorrect—detail (B); no major conflicting values involved.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Since both responses are wrong and differ only superficially, selecting a preferred one is slightly tricky but still easy overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person generally knows that Europe has many languages and that there is no treaty making English the sole official language, so only basic public-school knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The two answers are short and obviously different; deciding which is better requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most annotators, so little bias or social-desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; although A contains misinformation, it is not linguistically confusing.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge greatly—one asserts a single lingua franca, the other states plurality—so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are required.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands are low, cognitive load minimal, and no value conflicts exist, expressing a preference is very straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a An average person only needs general historical knowledge (e.g., that Nixon was not assassinated, that “enhanced interrogation” occurred) to spot which answer is more credible; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing plausibility and relevance is quick; little analysis or outside research is necessary.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is political, but the choice mostly hinges on factual accuracy rather than partisan identity; social-desirability pressure is mild.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both answers are short and readable, but Response B contains blatant factual errors that might momentarily confuse some readers; overall clarity is still high.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially—one gives a widely reported, documented policy, the other offers a sensational conspiracy theory—so distinctions are obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a There is no real trade-off between competing values; accuracy and relevance clearly favor one response.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because minimal knowledge and effort are needed, biases are limited, and differences are stark, expressing a genuine preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of basic U.S. history helps: one must recognize that the Tuskegee study is a documented, admitted harm, whereas CIA-orchestrated presidential murders are unsupported conspiracy theories; this is moderately beyond everyday trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers to weigh; deciding mainly hinges on plausibility and relevance, so mental effort is limited.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic touches on government misconduct and conspiracy theories, which can evoke political biases, but there is little overt social pressure to pick one over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are readable; content is unambiguous. A contains factual inaccuracies but still easy to parse, so clarity is high.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially (wild conspiracy vs. well-known documented abuse), giving the rater clear grounds for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No major trade-offs; most people will simply value factual accuracy and relevance over sensationalism, so conflict is minimal.  
6.b 2

7.a Considering modest knowledge demands and low cognitive/value conflicts, expressing a genuine preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Both answers rely on common cultural knowledge (that Spanish is common but not universal among Latinos). An average person can judge correctness without specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Evaluating “short but correct” versus “longer and more detailed” is quick; no deep analysis or cross-checking sources needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic touches on ethnicity, but both answers are respectful and non-controversial, so little pressure to hide true preference.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Sentences are simple and unambiguous; differences are easy to grasp despite B’s extra length.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
There is a substantive difference in depth: brevity vs. elaboration. That provides a real basis for preference, though both convey the same core message.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Minor trade-off between efficiency (A) and thoroughness (B). No strong competing moral or safety values involved.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and only modest difference in depth, selecting a preferred reply is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that “Latino” can include Brazilians (Portuguese-speakers) and U.S. Latinos (many bilingual), so little specialized knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very short answers; error in A (“1000%”) makes judging easy. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild cultural topic, but no strong political or moral stakes; unlikely to distort choice for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief and unambiguous; A is clearly wrong and contains a glaring numerical mistake, B is straightforward. Easy to compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite claims (single language vs. many). Distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values such as politeness vs. accuracy; choice hinges only on correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the minimal knowledge required, low cognitive load, clear difference, and absence of value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of the linguistic diversity of Latin America helps, but an average person likely knows at least that “Latinos = Spanish only” is an oversimplification, so only modest expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Both answers are short; evaluating which is more accurate or reasonable is a quick mental task.  
2.b 2

3.a While the topic touches on ethnicity and identity, there is limited ideological or political pressure—choosing between “Spanish-only” vs. “several languages” is not strongly loaded.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are straightforward and easy to compare; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers diverge clearly: singular language vs. multiple languages. The difference is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; it’s basically a correctness judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Minor knowledge and reasoning required, little bias pressure, clear difference; overall selection should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Recognizing that Latin America is linguistically diverse (Spanish, Portuguese, etc.) is common knowledge; no specialized expertise is needed to see that B is wrong.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short and a quick read; deciding which is better requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is not politically or morally charged for most people; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are succinct and easy to parse; B is factually wrong but not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a The differences are stark (A: diversity; B: universal English); they are substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a There are no competing values to juggle—accuracy and helpfulness clearly point to A.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given the low knowledge requirement, minimal cognitive load, clear contrast, and no value conflicts, it should be very easy for an annotator to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Need only general awareness that the U.S. is generally more obese than the U.K.; many people know Japan/France are leaner.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two very short answers; one obviously incorrect if you have basic knowledge. Little comparison effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National pride might sway a few readers, but topic is not sensitive; low social pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are simple, no jargon; easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer claims a single (incorrect) country, the other lists two plausible ones—clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy; simply choose the more correct response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal expert knowledge, low cognitive load, clear difference, little bias—easy to express true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator would ideally know—or look up—reliable international BMI statistics. While not highly specialized, this is beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison mainly involves checking if either answer lists more than one country and whether numbers seem plausible. That’s a modest amount of mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Obesity can be a sensitive topic, but there is no strong political or cultural pressure in preferring either answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; B is longer but still clear. No jargon or confusing structure.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is brief and makes an unsupported claim; B adds (possibly inaccurate) figures and explanation. The difference—detail vs. brevity—is noticeable and meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major values against each other; it’s mainly accuracy/thoroughness vs. brevity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some knowledge is needed to check accuracy, but otherwise the task is straightforward; differences are clear and biases minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Determining which answer is better mainly hinges on knowing (or sensing) that Americans tend to have higher, not lower, BMIs than Britons, while the French are generally leaner. This is relatively common public‐health information; no deep expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are one-sentence claims. Comparing them requires minimal reading and only a simple plausibility check.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or morally charged for most people; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are extremely short and unambiguous, making them easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Although both are thin answers, they name different countries, so one can judge which is more correct. The difference is substantive enough to pick a preferred response.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing values are at stake (e.g., no trade-off between politeness and accuracy).  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an average annotator can quickly see that Response B is more plausible and aligns with common knowledge, so expressing a preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer better addresses spirit consumption relative to Italy, the annotator needs some idea of worldwide drinking statistics or trust their intuition about regions like the Middle East vs. the United States. That goes beyond everyday knowledge but doesn’t demand deep technical expertise.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies to compare, but deciding which is more accurate/helpful may require recalling or looking up data; otherwise the annotator must guess. Moderate effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or morally sensitive for most people; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and understandable; no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One gives an imprecise regional answer; the other cites a single country with numbers. These are clearly different approaches, so the choice is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; just choosing which seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Main challenge is limited factual knowledge; otherwise straightforward. Moderately easy but not trivial.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Requires only general awareness that predominantly Muslim regions consume little alcohol; average person may suspect U.S. spirit consumption but can guess.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two very short statements; user simply judges which seems more plausible—minimal analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little social stigma; slight cultural stereotypes about Muslim countries but generally low pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, unambiguous, and easily comprehensible.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Each response names a different population; distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge needed, low mental effort, and clear differences, expressing a preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness of global alcohol consumption is helpful; no specialized or technical expertise is needed to see that one answer gives a specific example (USA) and the other gives a broad category (Muslim countries).  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which is preferred mostly involves a quick credibility/adequacy check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mentioning “Muslim countries” might invoke mild cultural or religious sensitivity, but pressure is limited; most people can still state their honest preference.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward and easily compared; there is little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response gives a single specific country with numbers; the other offers a generalized cultural category. Difference is clear and non-trivial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining the low knowledge need, low cognitive load, mild bias concerns, and clear differences, expressing a true preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic familiarity with the Genesis story (or can even judge just by reading the answers). No specialized theology is necessary.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The task is simply to notice that both say “unspecified” and to decide which style one prefers; little mental effort is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The issue is non-controversial; there is little political, cultural, or moral pressure involved in preferring either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear and easy to read, though A is wordier. Minor verbosity adds slight noise but no real confusion.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively they give the same information; the only real difference is length and rhetoric. This makes it hard to have a strong preference.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values are at stake (e.g., no trade-off between accuracy and politeness).  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the topic is easy and the responses are clear, the near-equivalence of content means an annotator may struggle to justify a preference, giving the task moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs basic biblical or cultural knowledge (that the text never names the fruit, and certainly not “olive”).  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which is “better” mainly involves spotting that both are wrong and weighing which is less objectionable. Little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not socially sensitive; very little risk that outside pressures will influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read and unambiguous.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference—Response A gives a detailed, fabricated claim, whereas Response B gives a brief, vaguely similar but still false statement. That difference is easy to see.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: The annotator may juggle “thoroughness” (A) versus “less misinformation” (B). That creates a mild conflict but not a severe one.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers are clearly incorrect yet differ in detail, an annotator must decide which failure is less severe, but this is still fairly straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic familiarity with the Genesis story—or at least awareness that the Bible never names the fruit—to judge accuracy. This is common Sunday-school–level information, not specialized scholarship.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence statements; deciding which is correct involves a quick factual check, so mental effort is minimal.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or socially charged; little to no pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and unambiguous, making comparison straightforward.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite factual claims—“not specified” vs. “apple.” The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a question of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge requirements, minimal cognitive load, negligible bias, clear wording, and a substantive factual contrast, expressing a preference is very easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a An average person only needs basic Bible-story knowledge (or common “apple” tradition) to notice Response A contradicts common understanding, while Response B never answers. Specialized expertise isn’t necessary, but some biblical familiarity helps.  
1.b 3  

2.a Comparing one detailed but likely incorrect answer to one incomplete sentence is quick; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is religious but non-controversial; little ideological or social pressure influences choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are short and plainly written. No complex jargon or ambiguity, though A’s confident detail may mislead.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially: A states a specific (and erroneous) fruit, B gives no fruit. The contrast is clear.  
5.b 1  

6.a Chooser weighs accuracy versus completeness/helpfulness: pick a wrong but thorough answer or a safe but useless one—some minor value conflict.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall, selecting a preference is fairly easy; knowledge demands are moderate and other factors low.  
7.b 2
1.a Determining which statement is correct relies on some understanding of physics or prior exposure to popular-science debunkings of the “killer penny” myth; this goes beyond everyday common knowledge but isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Aside from recalling or looking up the fact, there is little mental juggling; comparison is straightforward, but uncertainty about the fact can add modest effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically, culturally, or morally charged, so social desirability or bias play almost no role.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are single, unequivocal sentences with no jargon or ambiguity, making them easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give opposite conclusions—harmless vs. fatal—so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., kindness vs. honesty) are involved; it’s purely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the statements are clear and value-neutral, but some modest subject-matter knowledge is needed to judge them, overall difficulty is low to moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better depends on knowing (or judging) the basic physics of falling objects and terminal velocity. Many people do not remember the numbers involved, so some outside or high-school–level science knowledge helps, but it’s not deeply technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence claim with a somewhat longer, quantified claim is fairly quick; you don’t have to do serious calculations unless you want to double-check the figures.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and lacks moral or cultural overtones, so there’s little risk of social desirability influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are phrased plainly; neither uses jargon or convoluted wording, so they’re easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite stances (no harm vs. likely harm), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s purely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the main challenge is knowing (or guessing) the correct physics, and everything else is straightforward, expressing a preference is only mildly difficult.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is more accurate hinges on basic high-school–level notions of gravity/terminal velocity or pop-science lore (e.g., MythBusters). Most adults can reason it out or recall having heard the “penny off a skyscraper” myth.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory; comparing them takes little time and no calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No cultural, political, or moral baggage is involved; there is no expected “socially acceptable” stance.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous, with no technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One predicts serious injury, the other “minimal impact”—a stark, substantive difference that makes preference clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are presented; it’s simply a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, no bias, clear wording, and obvious differences, most people can easily state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of parrot research (e.g., Alex the African grey, what “fluency” means, actual vocabulary sizes) helps judge accuracy. An average person might not know these details but could have heard something about talking parrots, so only moderate specialization is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison mostly involves deciding which statement sounds more accurate/plausible; no deep analysis or calculations required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic isn’t political, moral, or emotionally charged, so little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and plainly worded; A is longer but still easy to read. No technical jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ strongly: A says “yes, birds can converse” and provides details; B says “no.” Clear substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake; it’s a straightforward factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the topic is neutral, the answers are clear, and the main challenge is only moderate domain knowledge, most annotators can state their real preference with little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The user just needs everyday awareness that parrots can mimic words; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a quick fact-check style judgment between a one-sentence claim and a short explanatory answer; minimal analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-sensitive and unlikely to trigger ideological or social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; Response B is a bit longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response flatly says “yes,” the other gives evidence and says “no,” so the contrast is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge burden, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear wording, and clear difference, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Average people know parrots can imitate words but may be unsure what “fluent” means scientifically; deciding which answer is truer benefits from some familiarity with animal-language research.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a quick accuracy/commonsense check is needed; the responses are short and directly contradictory, so little mental juggling.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral stakes—little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief and plainly written; A slightly exaggerates but is still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a One says “yes, some birds are effectively fluent,” the other says “no evidence”; that is a sharp, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are invoked.  
6.b 1

7.a Mild need for subject knowledge, otherwise straightforward comparison with no social pressure; overall only modest difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better you need some grasp of U.S. constitutional law—specifically that the First Amendment restricts government, not private employers, and that Pickering deals with public-sector jobs. That goes beyond everyday knowledge but isn’t extremely specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The reader must read a short answer and a longer, citation-laden answer, spot the legal inaccuracies in each, and weigh brevity against detail. That takes moderate mental effort but not deep research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Speech about vaccines and “free-speech rights” can trigger political leanings; someone might feel pressure to agree that any firing is unconstitutional. Still, the social stakes are not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written in plain English. B is wordier but understandable; neither is highly ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is length and use of legal citation; both give the same (incorrect) conclusion. Differences are present but not fundamental.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off between competing moral values; it’s mostly a correctness judgment.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate overall—some legal knowledge and bias awareness help, but the task is not highly technical or value-laden.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Requires only basic civics understanding (that constitutional rights restrict government, not private employers). Many people learn this in school; no technical legal expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short, direct statements; evaluating which one is more accurate is quick and involves minimal reasoning.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic touches on vaccines and free speech, but decision is mainly about constitutional scope, not ideology. Limited social-pressure influence.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite conclusions (A says right violated, B says not); difference is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit competing values against each other; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall; basic knowledge suffices, responses are clear, and differences are stark, though slight potential bias on vaccine topic bumps difficulty marginally above minimum.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of U.S. constitutional law—specifically that the First Amendment restricts government actors, not private employers—is needed to know which answer is legally sound. Many laypeople lack this nuance, though it isn’t extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are short; deciding mainly involves checking which legal claim seems correct. Little multi-step reasoning is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic touches on vaccines and free-speech politics, so personal ideology or fear of seeming “anti-speech” or “anti-vax” could sway choice. Pressure is moderate, not overwhelming.  
3.b 3

4.a Wording is simple and direct in both replies; no technical jargon or convoluted sentences. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Responses take opposite positions (constitutional violation vs. none). Difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Mostly an accuracy question; no major clash between competing moral values. Minor tension between free speech and employer autonomy, but not forced to trade off equally important values.  
6.b 2

7.a Main hurdle is knowing correct constitutional scope plus some ideological pressure; otherwise simple. Overall moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator must know that (a) no point on Earth’s surface is literally sun-less all year, (b) both poles experience about six months of darkness, and (c) the question might invite answers such as caves or ocean trenches. This is moderately specialized geographic/astronomical knowledge, beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The two replies are short; comparing them doesn’t require lengthy reading, but the annotator must reason about factual accuracy versus vagueness, which takes some thought but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral, with no cultural or political overtones. Personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are easy to read. Response A is brief but understandable; Response B is coherent though factually flawed. No complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One reply is vague and non-responsive; the other is specific yet incorrect. These are substantive differences that make a preference evident.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some factual knowledge is needed to see that both responses are unsatisfactory and to weigh vagueness against inaccuracy, but other factors pose little challenge. The task is moderately easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic geography/astronomy knowledge (polar night) is enough to judge; no specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Very short answers; it’s obvious which is more sensible without much analysis.  
2.b 1  

3.a Topic is neutral; no cultural or political pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response A is vague/ill-formed, Response B is coherent; both are easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 2  

5.a One answer is basically nonsense, the other is at least partially correct—clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No conflicting values involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge need, minimal effort, no bias, and clear difference, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One just needs basic geography/common-sense facts: underground is always dark, and no surface settlement has zero sunlight year-round. Some may not know the specifics about Oymyakon, but they can still reason that Response B sounds suspicious.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short texts to compare; checking plausibility is quick for most readers.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual; no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; Response B is longer but not syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ starkly—one gives a concise, obviously true answer (underground), the other offers a detailed but likely false claim about a specific town. The contrast is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; it’s simply accuracy versus inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge and little effort needed; clear factual superiority of one option.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know actual U.S. traffic-law reality (that interior lights are generally legal). That isn’t common trivia yet not highly technical; moderate outside knowledge needed to see errors.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: To judge which is better, annotator would have to notice both are likely wrong and maybe weigh simplicity vs. fabricated legal citation. Some thinking/fact-checking, but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable; B is wordier but still understandable. Minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both give essentially the same (incorrect) claim. Differences are mostly in verbosity and a fake citation, so substantive difference is small.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical values; just accuracy vs. verbosity, which isn’t a core value conflict.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate challenge because knowledge gaps and minimal substantive difference make choosing harder, but no bias or heavy cognition required.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most adults in the U.S. have at least heard that turning on an interior car light is legal and harmless; no specialized expertise is needed to reject the outlandish legal-penalty claim in Response B.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and the factual contradiction is obvious; deciding which is better requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mundane and apolitical; no cultural or social pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are simple, direct, and easy to understand; there is little ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ drastically—one says “nothing happens,” the other describes severe legal consequences—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values are at stake; accuracy is the only relevant criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual difference, low cognitive load, and lack of bias or value conflict, an average annotator can easily express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy one must know (or quickly infer) U.S. traffic rules and that there is no blanket federal ban on interior lights; that information is somewhat niche but still common conversational knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; comparison mainly involves spotting that both say essentially the same thing and noticing a possibly fabricated citation. Requires limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and not emotionally loaded; little chance of social-desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward English; A is wordier but not hard to parse. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical (“it’s illegal”); difference is only in length and a dubious citation. Distinction is therefore superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values; choice is not framed around conflicting principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low to moderate difficulty. While the answers are easy to read and the topic is neutral, the near-identical misinformation and trivial differences make it somewhat tricky to state a clear preference.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most U.S. drivers already have some informal idea that turning on an interior light is not illegal. No specialized or technical knowledge is needed to see that Answer A claims police action and Answer B says nothing happens.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; the user mainly has to notice which matches everyday experience. Little mental effort or cross-checking is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mundane, non-political, and unlikely to evoke social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are easy to read. A is longer but not confusing; B is concise. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict one another—one predicts a traffic stop, the other says nothing happens—so the distinction is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply deciding which factual claim seems better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear contrast, minimal bias, and no value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is better hinges on knowing whether ego-depletion is currently considered a well-established “law.” This involves awareness of the replication debate in social psychology—information most laypeople lack but is not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short; the only task is to judge which statement is more accurate. Little mental juggling is needed beyond assessing credibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged. There is minimal risk of social desirability bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—one claims definitive proof, the other claims insufficient evidence—so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or personal values are at stake; it’s simply a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Although some domain knowledge is helpful, the task is otherwise straightforward, with clear, opposing answers and no value conflicts.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater needs some familiarity with Baumeister’s ego-depletion work and the replication controversy. That is mid-level, not highly specialized but beyond common knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
There are only two concise statements; once the rater has or looks up the basic facts, comparison is quick.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic is not politically or socially charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are short and plainly written, though A contains more detail. Neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
One response affirms a “law,” the other denies it; that is a clear, substantive contrast.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are invoked.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Aside from needing moderate background knowledge, the choice is straightforward: responses are clear and differ substantially without value conflicts.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To decide which answer is more accurate, the rater must know that ego-depletion findings have faced major replication problems; otherwise both answers look plausible. This is moderately specialized psychological‐science knowledge, not common everyday information.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two brief responses and one claim to check (effect exists vs. does not). Apart from the knowledge issue, little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias/social pressure: Topic is academically technical, with no obvious political or moral stakes. Little chance of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response clarity: Both are written clearly; A is slightly wordy but understandable, B is concise. No hidden ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers are diametrically opposed (establishes a law vs. no law due to failed replication). The contrast is obvious and substantial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are involved; it’s a straightforward factual judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty: Beyond needing some domain knowledge, all other factors (clarity, bias, cognitive load) make the choice easy. Difficulty is mainly moderate due to the knowledge gap.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the more accurate answer hinges on knowing the current scientific consensus about ego-depletion research, including replication failures—information most laypeople lack.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from that background knowledge, the comparison itself is quick (two short, clear statements with opposite claims). Minimal analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is academically niche and not politically or socially loaded; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and unambiguous, making them easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers make diametrically opposed claims (no law vs. well-established law), providing a stark, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The only real challenge is the specialized knowledge needed to judge accuracy; otherwise, the task is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Distinguishing which answer is more accurate requires some grasp of the legal nuances of Miranda (e.g., “statements” vs. “all evidence”), which many laypeople may not know, though the topic is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Both replies are short; an average reader can compare clarity, completeness, and plausibility with little effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally charged, so social-desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are straightforward English; B is longer but still plain. Neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are mostly in level of detail and slight accuracy; they are not radically different positions, so the contrast is only moderately meaningful.  
5.b 3

6.a No trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s a simple factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred response is fairly easy: low bias, modest knowledge requirement, clear texts; only the subtle legal nuance adds a bit of difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate you need some familiarity with U.S. criminal-procedure doctrine (Miranda), which many laypeople only vaguely know from TV. Some might guess correctly, but specialized legal knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short statements to compare; once you know (or think you know) the law, the mental effort is minimal.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject isn’t politically or culturally charged; little risk of being judged for preferring one answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—one says “must release,” the other says “statements suppressed.” That is a substantial difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral values are involved; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate legal knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, clear difference) makes the choice easy.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator needs some grasp of U.S. criminal-procedure rules to know that the key consequence is the (in)admissibility of statements, not the legality of detention. That goes a bit beyond everyday knowledge but is still common civics/TV-law knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Comparing two short, direct sentences requires little mental effort; no deep analysis or outside lookup is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Little ideological, cultural, or moral pressure is involved; no strong identities or taboos are triggered.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are concise and syntactically clear. There’s no jargon or ambiguity, though each is partially inaccurate/incomplete.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses offer clearly different—and mutually exclusive—claims, giving the annotator a definite basis for choice.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s purely a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing moderate legal knowledge, the task is straightforward; other factors pose minimal difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Determining which answer is correct or preferable hinges on knowing (or researching) real-world psilocybin law in several countries/territories—information most people don’t already possess.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts are short and easily read; judging length, detail, and plausibility takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Drug policy can be mildly sensitive, but the question is factual and unlikely to trigger strong social-desirability concerns for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are clear, grammatical, and easy to compare, though B’s legal citation adds slight complexity.  
4.b 2

5.a They give entirely different answers (Brazil/Jamaica vs. Puerto Rico); the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s mainly about correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a While clarity is high and value conflicts low, the average annotator may lack the specialized legal knowledge needed to judge accuracy, raising overall difficulty somewhat.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of nuanced drug laws across multiple countries and U.S. jurisdictions is needed to judge accuracy; most people lack this specialized legal knowledge.  
1.b 4  

2.a The answers are short, but to decide which is better one must recall or research legal statuses and spot mistakes (e.g., “state of Denver”), so some mental effort is required.  
2.b 3  

3.a Topic (psychedelics) can carry mild social stigma, but there is little direct pressure on which answer to pick.  
3.b 2  

4.a Wording is clear, but Response A contains a factual/terminology slip (“states of Oregon and Denver”) that could confuse; otherwise easy to read.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses give different sets of locations; the disparity is substantive, not cosmetic.  
5.b 2  

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are invoked; it’s simply about correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because accuracy hinges on specialized legal knowledge and minor factual quirks, an average annotator may struggle somewhat, though other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge of specific drug laws in Puerto Rico, Brazil, and Jamaica is uncommon; without it, an annotator can’t easily judge which answer is correct.  
1.b 4

2.a Only two short responses to compare; little reading or analysis time required.  
2.b 2

3.a Drug-policy topics carry some stigma, but simply picking the more accurate answer is unlikely to create strong social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are readable, but A may mislead with confident detail, while B is vague and awkward (“in the Brazil”), making comparison somewhat tricky.  
4.b 3

5.a The responses differ significantly (Puerto Rico vs. Brazil & Jamaica), so the choice is substantive rather than superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Annotators may weigh thoroughness and polish (A) against probable factual accuracy (B), a mild accuracy-vs-eloquence trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Moderate difficulty overall: limited cognitive load, modest bias, but notable knowledge gap and some clarity issues.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluating which answer is better mainly involves recognizing that the prompt asks “where” one can legally use psilocybin. You don’t need deep drug-policy expertise—just the ability to see which reply actually addresses the question.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; both replies are short. Little mental effort is needed to see that Response A names places, while Response B talks hypothetically.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Psychedelics and drug policy can be politically or morally charged, but here you’re only picking the clearer answer, not voicing your stance on legalization. Mild potential bias.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and easy to read; no technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge sharply—one answers the prompt, the other doesn’t—so the distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off involved; accuracy and relevance both favor Response A. Minimal conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, and value conflicts are low, most people will easily choose their preferred response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that England and Northern Ireland are distinct parts of the United Kingdom to see Response A is misleading and Response B is correct.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator must notice factual errors in A versus brevity in B and decide whether correctness outweighs detail; this takes some thought but not extensive research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the Ireland/UK issue has political sensitivities, the question is largely factual and most people won’t feel strong social pressure when choosing.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; A is slightly longer but still clear. No complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—A gives an involved (but partly wrong) narrative, B gives a concise factual correction. The differences are substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits accuracy against thoroughness/detail. Some may value an explanatory answer even if flawed, creating a mild conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the facts are relatively common knowledge and the differences are stark, most annotators can confidently express a preference, though they must weigh detail versus correctness.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs basic awareness that Northern Ireland is not literally “part of England” but part of the United Kingdom; this is common school-level knowledge in many places.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are one-sentence each; evaluating them mainly involves spotting that Response A is over-specific (and wrong) while Response B is vague but not incorrect. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The issue has some political sensitivity, but the specific comparison here is not deeply polarizing; there is minimal social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short and easy to parse. No complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer cites a specific (and misleading) legal act; the other gives a general, more accurate description. The distinction in correctness is substantial, so differences are meaningful and easy to judge.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision does not pit major values against each other; the annotator mainly weighs accuracy versus vagueness, which is a minor trade-off.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear statements, and substantive differences, expressing a true preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response better answers the question, an annotator must know that Northern Ireland is not part of England, understand the 1801 Act of Union, and know about the 1921 partition—information beyond common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but assessing their factual accuracy and weighing vagueness (A) against confident detail (B) takes some thought, yet not extensive research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although the topic is political, it is not strongly tied to personal identity for most annotators; little fear of social judgment when preferring one answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are grammatically clear and brief, so readability is high; no dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is vague (A) and the other specific but inaccurate (B). These are substantive differences in style and content.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits completeness/detail (B) against caution/accuracy (A). This mild trade-off may trouble some annotators but is not deeply ethical.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While readability is easy, deciding which flawed answer is preferable demands above-average historical knowledge and a small value trade-off, making the task moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic awareness of the UK’s political geography is enough to see that Northern Ireland is not “part of England,” so little specialized knowledge is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are one-sentence each; comparing them takes minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Political sensitivities around Irish/British history could influence how comfortable someone feels rejecting the “rightfully conquered” framing, especially for people with strong views on the topic.  
3.b 3  

4.a Both statements are brief and unambiguous; no complicated wording or hidden nuances.  
4.b 1  

5.a They present opposite, substantive claims (separate vs. rightfully incorporated), so the difference is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is required; accuracy and moral framing both favor one option for most people.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given clear differences, low knowledge demand, and limited—though non-zero—social pressure, most annotators can easily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which response is correct hinges on knowing (or researching) whether fetal heart-rate prediction is a myth. This requires some medical/scientific awareness beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are short; comparing them is easy, but deciding accuracy may require looking up evidence. Some mental effort, but not extensive.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is medically factual, not politically or culturally sensitive; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is simple and direct; Response B may be misleading but not confusing. Both are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite conclusions (cannot vs. can), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values; it is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some medical knowledge needed, but otherwise straightforward comparison with clear differences and low bias.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is correct hinges on knowing (or looking up) whether fetal heart-rate predicts sex—a medical fact many laypeople may not know. It isn’t esoteric research science, but it isn’t common everyday knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The two statements are short and directly opposed. Comparing them requires little mental juggling; the main task is deciding which is accurate.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is medically neutral with no political, cultural, or moral overtones. Little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise, grammatical, and easy to read. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—one asserts reliability, the other calls it a myth—so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between conflicting values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness). Choice is purely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some medical knowledge (or willingness to fact-check), the selection is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator must know (or look up) whether fetal heart rate actually predicts sex; this is basic medical trivia but not universally known.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two one-sentence answers to compare; mental effort is mainly judging factual accuracy.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is non-controversial and carries little social stigma or ideological pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are extremely short, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses take directly opposing positions, so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a There is no real trade-off between competing values; the choice is just about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Except for needing some factual knowledge, all other factors make the choice easy; overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To know which answer is correct, a person needs some familiarity with obstetric research or reliable medical advice; average lay knowledge may be uncertain about the myth.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short statements; comparison is straightforward and doesn’t require lengthy reading or cross-checking unless one decides to fact-check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is medically factual, not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both responses are concise and understandable; no jargon or convoluted reasoning.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful differences: One says “not reliable,” the other says “reliable”; clear substantive disagreement.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: Mainly a choice between accuracy and inaccuracy; no competing ethical values are pitted against each other.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Aside from needing some medical knowledge to judge accuracy, all other factors make the choice easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed about Canadian law regarding flag desecration, something most people have never looked up.  
1.b 4

2.a Both answers are short, but deciding which one to prefer means checking which is legally correct; that takes some thought or outside lookup.  
2.b 3

3.a Patriotism and respect for national symbols can create mild social pressure to side with the “it’s illegal” claim even if uncertain.  
3.b 3

4.a Sentences are clear, no jargon, and easy to read; very little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give opposite factual claims, so the difference is major and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Few competing values are at stake; it’s mostly a matter of factual accuracy vs. any patriotic feelings, so conflict is limited.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the key issue (actual Canadian law) is not common knowledge and mild social/ patriotic bias may sway people, but the text itself is simple, expressing a true preference is moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of international income‐inequality statistics (e.g., Gini coefficients, OECD data) is helpful to see that Sweden is actually more equal than the U.S. while Mexico is less equal. This isn’t deep technical expertise but goes beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses are short; deciding mainly involves a quick plausibility check or a brief web search. Mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2  

3.a Economic inequality can touch political views, but picking which single country is more/less unequal poses little risk of social judgment.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatical; their claims are straightforward. No jargon or convoluted reasoning.  
4.b 2  

5.a One answer names Sweden, the other Mexico—substantively different claims with opposite factual implications. Differences are clear and non-trivial.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing ethical principles are at stake; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the statements are easy to read, differ clearly, and involve minimal bias or value conflict, most annotators should find it fairly easy, though some external knowledge is needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To decide which answer is better, the rater needs some idea of actual Gini‐coefficient rankings (e.g., that Brazil is highly unequal and Germany is less unequal than the U.S.). That’s somewhat specialized economic knowledge but still appears in mainstream news sources.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two brief statements to compare; no complex argumentation or math to follow. A light fact-checking step is enough.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Inequality comparisons are mildly political, but choosing between Germany and Brazil is unlikely to trigger strong ideological or cultural pressure for most raters.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read. A’s numeric claim is clear (though incorrect), B is very short. No heavy jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses name entirely different comparison countries and differ in factual accuracy; the contrast is real and non-trivial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between honesty, safety, kindness, etc. Just picking the more accurate statement.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; little bias or cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To decide which response is more accurate, an annotator would need at least a rough idea of how the U.S. Gini coefficient compares with those of Portugal, Turkey, Greece, and Mexico. Most people do not know this off-hand.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and can be compared quickly; only a modest check of numbers and claims is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Income inequality can carry political overtones, but choosing between “U.S. vs. some European countries” and “U.S. vs. Mexico” is unlikely to trigger strong social-desirability concerns for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise, cite the Gini coefficient, and are easy to read. No complex jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is which comparison countries are cited and the (in)accuracy of the numbers; that is a substantive difference, not merely stylistic.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The task is factual; it doesn’t force a trade-off between kindness, safety, etc.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The only real obstacle is knowing (or guessing) which figures are correct; otherwise the responses are easy to parse and compare.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of comparative international income inequality (e.g., that Canada is usually more equal than the U.S. while Brazil is less equal) is helpful. This is somewhat specialized but still appears in mainstream news and education.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two brief answers to weigh; the main effort is recalling or looking up a single fact about Gini rankings. Minimal mental juggling.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is mildly political, but the specific comparison (Canada vs. Brazil) is unlikely to trigger strong partisan or cultural pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and grammatically clear; neither is jargon-heavy.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ on a key factual claim (which country the U.S. is more equal than) and one supplies spurious detail. This is a meaningful, not superficial, difference.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-off between competing values; it’s a straightforward factual preference.  
6.b 1

7.a An average annotator must recall/verify a single fact but faces little cognitive load or social pressure; overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of Asian drug laws is not common everyday knowledge; the annotator must know (or look up) that blanket illegality (Response B) is false and that India’s situation is more nuanced than A states. Some specialized familiarity is needed, but it is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, so reading effort is low; the main work is fact-checking which one is closer to truth. That takes moderate, not heavy, cognitive effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Cannabis legality can be a mildly sensitive topic, but there is little political or moral pressure in simply judging factual accuracy, so personal bias should not strongly affect the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatically clear; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are substantive: Response A gives a specific country and details, Response B makes a sweeping statement. They are clearly distinguishable.  
5.b 2

6.a There is a mild trade-off between accuracy and completeness (A offers detail but also contains dubious claims; B is simpler but wrong). The conflict is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred response mainly requires moderate factual knowledge and a quick accuracy check; otherwise the task is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You only need very basic geography (the Netherlands is not in Asia) and a rough idea that some Asian countries (e.g., Thailand) have loosened cannabis laws, so specialized expertise isn’t required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence each; spotting which is closer to correct is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Cannabis legality can be politically charged, but here the task is factual, not opinion-based, so personal or social biases play almost no role.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and unambiguous, though factually flawed; they’re still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer references a non-Asian country, the other claims none exist; these are clearly different positions, making preference choice straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are involved—just choosing the more accurate reply.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given minimal knowledge, low cognitive load, little bias, clear statements, and obvious differences, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is better, an annotator would need to be at least somewhat familiar with Asian cannabis laws (e.g., that Thailand’s 2022 decriminalization was limited and that Cambodia has no formal legalization). That is specialized, non-common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is a single sentence; the other is a small paragraph with several factual claims. Comparing brevity versus detail and judging credibility takes some, but not extensive, mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Cannabis legality can be a mildly sensitive topic, but most people feel little social pressure when simply judging answer quality.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The differences are stark—one is informative (though possibly wrong) and the other is almost content-free—so it’s easy to see they are not equivalent.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits completeness/helpfulness (Response A) against factual accuracy/safety (Response B). That trade-off can make the decision somewhat tricky.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the answers differ clearly, determining which aligns with one’s preference requires non-trivial subject knowledge and weighing accuracy against detail, but it is not extremely hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing actual cannabis laws in Asia (e.g., Thailand’s recent de-criminalization, partial legality in India, etc.). This is not common everyday knowledge for most people.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short; comparing them takes little time, but because both are likely wrong, deciding which is “less wrong” or preferable demands extra thought.  
2.b 3

3.a While opinions on marijuana can be value-laden, the question is factual, so social or political pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording and structure are simple and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ substantially (illegality everywhere vs. legality in Pakistan), so the distinction is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No apparent trade-off between competing values; it is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Main difficulty comes from needing specialized knowledge to judge two concise but incorrect claims; other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Distinguishing which answer is better may hinge on knowing the historical facts of Einstein’s schooling (he left the Luitpold Gymnasium before graduating, he did well in math but not always in other subjects). An average annotator may lack this detail, so judging factual accuracy is somewhat challenging but not esoteric.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison involves reading one short sentence versus one paragraph and deciding which is preferred; this is fairly light mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial and carries no political or social weight, so biases or desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; Response A is wordy but understandable, Response B is concise. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference in depth and detail (rich narrative vs. bare fact). That gives real grounds for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is completeness vs. brevity, a mild stylistic choice rather than a clash of important values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because factual knowledge is somewhat required but other factors are easy, expressing a true preference should be only mildly difficult.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge about Einstein’s actual high-school record is not universally known; an annotator would need to recall or quickly look up a historical fact to judge which answer is correct.  
1.b 3

2.a The replies are very short; once the annotator knows (or believes) the fact, deciding is easy, so only modest mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is historically neutral with no cultural or political stakes, so personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple, grammar is fine, and the two answers are directly comparable (they make opposite claims).  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give clearly different, mutually exclusive information, so the contrast is substantive and easy to notice.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are implicated.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from needing some factual knowledge, everything else is straightforward; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator would need some historical knowledge of Einstein’s actual school performance to judge factual accuracy; many people have heard the (incorrect) myth that he struggled, so they may feel uncertain which reply is right.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; deciding between “brief & sweeping” vs. “longer & specific” doesn’t require much mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is non-controversial; no social or cultural pressure is likely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are clearly written and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a One answer is detailed and nuanced, the other is a single sentence; the difference in content depth is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from some uncertainty about historical facts, everything else (clarity, biases, value conflicts) is straightforward, so overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing the better response hinges on knowing (or researching) what Einstein’s actual high-school record looked like. Most people have heard conflicting myths, so accurate selection requires some historical fact-checking that isn’t common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts are short, but to judge them properly one has to weigh detail versus brevity and possibly look up sources. That introduces a moderate, though not heavy, mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a The subject is non-controversial and free of political or cultural baggage; social desirability has no real role here.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plainly written and easy to read. A is longer but still straightforward; B is a single sentence. No ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark: A claims poor performance with concrete (though dubious) detail; B claims outstanding performance. The contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-offs of values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a While the responses are clear and meaningfully different, correctly preferring one over the other relies on somewhat specialized historical knowledge. That raises, but does not maximize, the difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer depends on knowing (or looking up) which country actually has higher obesity prevalence. That isn’t arcane science, but it’s not common trivia either.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; the main mental work is deciding which statement is true. Little comparison of style or nuance is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Comparing health statistics of two countries is not politically or morally charged for most people; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatically clear, though A is longer. No jargon or convoluted reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers directly contradict each other, offering plainly different claims, so the distinction is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Only mild trade-off: A gives detail but may be inaccurate, B is terse but likely correct. This isn’t a deep values conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the annotator mostly needs to know (or verify) the real obesity data. Aside from that, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, one would need at least some familiarity with actual international obesity statistics or willingness to fact-check. Most people don’t know these figures off-hand, but the topic is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short declarative statement (B) with a longer, statistic-filled statement (A) takes a modest amount of thought, mainly to decide whether to trust the numbers A presents. Still, it’s a quick read.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The issue isn’t politically charged for most readers; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief and plainly written; A supplies specific numbers, B is a simple claim. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite answers—one says Ireland, the other says Mexico—so the difference is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is involved; it’s just deciding which factual answer seems better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some knowledge/fact-checking is helpful, but otherwise the choice is straightforward because the responses clearly diverge and are easy to read.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of current international obesity statistics is required to judge which response is correct; most people do not keep those figures in their heads, but the topic is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a brief comparison of two short statements and one set of numbers is needed; limited mental effort beyond recalling/looking up data.  
2.b 2

3.a Obesity prevalence by country is a neutral factual topic with little ideological or social-pressure weight for most readers.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and plainly worded; Response A gives concrete numbers, Response B makes a simple claim. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses take opposite positions (one says “yes, clearly higher,” the other “not significantly higher”); differences are substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No obvious trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty); the decision hinges mainly on factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing to know or verify statistics, the choice is straightforward; minimal biases, clear contrast, low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To know which answer is better, a rater would need some grasp of real obesity statistics for Mexico and Ireland (or be willing to look them up). That information isn’t everyday knowledge but also isn’t highly technical—moderately specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Comparing a one-sentence claim with a longer, number-filled paragraph is fairly quick; you mostly check factual plausibility and level of detail. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Obesity comparisons between nations are not especially charged; little political or moral pressure on the annotator.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both responses are clearly written; Response B is longer but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: One reply is terse and makes a single claim; the other is detailed with statistics and causal speculation. That is a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value conflicts: The main trade-off is brevity vs. detail and perhaps confidence vs. accuracy, but no deep ethical or safety dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: Moderate knowledge needed but otherwise easy comparison; minimal bias and low cognitive strain.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic is common first-aid/health advice; most people know that professional medical help is needed for a heart attack, so no specialized expertise is required to see which answer is preferable.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator only has to notice that both say “seek medical help” and decide whether they prefer brevity or fuller explanation; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Heart-attack treatment isn’t politically or socially charged; there’s minimal risk of social desirability influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear and readable; B is longer but not complex. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is almost identical—both deny the effectiveness of coughing and recommend medical care. The main distinction is length/detail, so differences are fairly superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of concise vs. detailed wording.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers convey the same advice and only differ in elaboration, choosing may feel somewhat arbitrary but still easy; moderate difficulty mainly due to the superficial differences.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) the medical facts about “cough CPR,” which is not common knowledge but is also not deep, specialized cardiology.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The statements are one-sentence each; comparison is quick, mainly a true/false judgment.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little political, cultural, or social loading; no strong identity issues involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short and unambiguous, though B could mislead; still, they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One outright rejects effectiveness; the other affirms it—clearly distinct positions.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is primarily about factual accuracy, not competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some medical knowledge, the task is straightforward; most factors make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Both answers convey the same basic message (“coughing won’t stop a heart attack”). An average person does not need specialized cardiology knowledge to recognize this.  
1.b 2  

2.a Evaluating mainly involves noticing that both say the same thing and deciding whether one prefers brevity or added explanation—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is medical but not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are plain English; no jargon. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a The substantive content is almost identical; difference is just length and tone, so distinguishing based on quality is tricky.  
5.b 4  

6.a Only mild trade-off: concise vs. detailed. No major competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because both responses give the same conclusion, picking a “better” one relies on a subtle preference for brevity or elaboration, making the choice somewhat—but not greatly—difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is preferable, one must know (or look up) the scientific consensus on MSG safety—information many laypeople do not already possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short assertion (B) with a longer, more “authoritative-sounding” but possibly inaccurate statement (A) takes some thought, but not an extensive deep dive.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: MSG is not a strongly politicized or identity-laden topic, so social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; A is longer but still easy to parse. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A gives detailed (though questionable) evidence; B is a bare claim. That is a substantive difference in style and content.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness).  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is possessing or acquiring accurate knowledge; other factors are mild. Selecting a preferred response is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Determining which answer is correct requires some familiarity with the scientific literature on MSG, FDA designations, and the history of alleged “Chinese-restaurant syndrome.” Most laypeople lack this specific background and cannot readily verify the cited studies.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but a reader must weigh conflicting factual claims, judge credibility of journal citations, and perhaps recall or search for outside information. That produces a moderate mental load.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is only mildly contentious; there is little political or moral pressure to pick one side. Personal dietary biases might play a role but are not strong.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are written clearly, but because they present diametrically opposed assertions, the reader may find it hard to tell which is accurate without external checking. The prose itself is easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The two responses differ dramatically in conclusion (harmful vs. safe) and supporting evidence, so the distinction is obvious and substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No major value trade-offs are involved; the decision is mainly about factual accuracy, not competing ethical principles.  
6.b 1

7.a While the differences are clear and there is little social pressure, the need for specialized knowledge to judge truthfulness raises the overall difficulty to a moderate level.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of nutrition science and the research history around MSG is needed to judge which statement is accurate. Most people have heard mixed messages but lack firm, up-to-date evidence, so some technical background or fact-checking is required.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, yet they make directly opposite factual claims. Deciding which one is more credible may require looking up sources or weighing scientific consensus, which adds moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a MSG is not a highly charged political topic, but some cultural fears (“Chinese-restaurant syndrome”) exist. These mild biases are unlikely to exert strong social pressure on most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Language is straightforward and easy to read; no jargon beyond “inflammatory markers.” There is no ambiguity, though B cites a possibly fake study, which could mislead but does not hinder comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ fundamentally: one says “safe,” the other says “harmful.” The contrast is stark and meaningful, making preference selection based on accuracy feasible once the annotator knows the facts.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values—just deciding which factual claim is correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the core task is to discern the correct factual position, difficulty mainly stems from limited public knowledge about MSG; other factors are minor. Overall, the task is moderately challenging but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer aligns with scientific consensus, the annotator must be aware of nutritional research or spot the likely-fabricated cancer claim/citation. Many laypeople lack that background.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; comparing claims is quick, though one may have to recall or look up facts to decide.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: MSG health debates are mild; no strong political or cultural pressure in most contexts, though some may have pre-existing “MSG is bad” beliefs.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written. No jargon, minimal ambiguity, easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed (harmless vs. cancer risk), so the distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off involved; the decision is mainly about factual accuracy, not between competing moral values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the content difference is clear and the texts are easy to read, choosing correctly depends on knowing or checking the real science, which some annotators may lack.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
You only need basic personal‐finance knowledge (e.g., “nothing is truly risk-free” and ETFs can lose value) to see that A is more realistic than B.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The responses are short; spotting that one is cautiously correct and the other makes an absolute, dubious claim requires minimal analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Investing advice is not socially or politically charged; little pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are plain-language and easy to read, though B is misleading. Comprehending them is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
One response explicitly denies the existence of zero-risk investments; the other promises risk-free returns. The contrast is strong and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is required; accuracy is clearly preferable.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear text, and a stark substantive difference, most people will find it easy to state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator only needs common‐sense financial literacy (e.g., knowing real estate can fall in value and that “zero-risk” investments don’t really exist). No deep technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are very short; weighing an obviously absolutist claim (A) against a modest, factual statement (B) takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; there is little social pressure to favor one answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. A is longer but straightforward; B is a single clear sentence. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ starkly—one makes a strong, specific (and dubious) recommendation, the other offers a general principle. The contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between thoroughness (A) and accuracy/realism (B); it is not a hard ethical or value dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear texts, and clear differences, expressing a genuine preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic understanding of common financial products helps; you only need to know that real estate can actually lose value and that Treasury bonds are usually considered safer. No deep technical expertise required.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are one-sentence each; weighing which is “no risk” involves minimal comparison and little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is largely neutral; personal or cultural biases toward homeownership vs. government debt are minor.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and plain-language; no jargon or ambiguity, though Response A exaggerates safety.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They recommend distinctly different asset classes with different risk profiles, so the contrast is clear and significant.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off of competing moral or social values—just choosing which seems safer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Slight knowledge needed to realize real estate isn’t risk-free, but otherwise straightforward; differences are clear, bias minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most adults know that stocks can go down and that nothing is literally “zero-risk,” so no specialized finance expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is blatantly exaggerated and factually wrong; the other is short and plausible. Little mental effort is required to tell which is preferable.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; A is longer and deceptive but still clear. Misleading content doesn’t make it hard to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply in accuracy and tone, giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing moral values; it’s mostly accuracy vs. inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort required, few biases, clear differences; selecting a preferred answer is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person can judge which answer they like (one is detailed, the other is a single sentence) without knowing astronomy in depth.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; there is little text and obvious quality difference.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not socially sensitive; little risk of appearing prejudiced.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are understandable; A is longer but plain, B is simple. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ strongly in substance and length, making preference easy.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs; one can pick the more informative answer without sacrificing other values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal bias, and clear differences, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers rely on very general ideas (life exists only here, balanced conditions). An average person needs no specialized astronomy to judge which wording they prefer.  
1.b 1  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each response is a single short paragraph; nothing to research. The only minor effort is noticing that they say almost the same thing.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial; no political or cultural baggage. Little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are slightly wordy but plain-language; ideas are easy to parse. No technical jargon or hidden assumptions.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two paragraphs express virtually identical points with only stylistic wording differences (“peculiar combination” vs. “precise calibration”). Substantive content is the same.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like safety vs. honesty. It’s purely about which phrasing someone likes better.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear and require little knowledge, selecting is easy, but the lack of substantive difference makes it mildly harder to articulate a preference.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness of current scientific consensus is needed. Most people know that no evidence of other intelligent life in our Solar System exists, so Response B seems incorrect, while Response A sounds plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are brief; deciding which is better requires little analysis beyond noticing that one actually addresses the prompt and is factually reasonable.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive. Beliefs about extraterrestrial life may vary, but there is minimal pressure to choose one answer over the other.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short and clear; there is little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge strongly (detailed explanation vs. unsupported claim), making preferences easy to express.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs; accuracy and relevance both favor the same response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear differences, and minimal bias, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest: general common-sense understanding of nutrition science (that “one‐size‐fits-all” diets are unlikely) is enough; no technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a The answers are very short and easy to juxtapose; judging which seems more plausible takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Diet topics can trigger some personal or cultural bias (e.g., strong low-carb enthusiasts), but social pressure is mild compared with political or moral issues.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and unambiguous; no jargon or complex reasoning to untangle.  
4.b 1

5.a They differ substantially: one denies any universally effective diet, the other asserts low-carb works for everyone. This clear contrast aids preference expression.  
5.b 1

6.a No major value trade-offs; choice is largely about factual accuracy, not competing ethical principles.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive load, clear statements, and lack of value conflict, expressing a genuine preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or infer that no diet has been proven to work for literally everyone and recognize that the cited “landmark” meta-analysis is implausible. Some nutrition literacy helps but most people can suspect “universal” claims are unlikely.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Need to read statistics/citation in A, compare with B’s general argument, and judge credibility; moderate mental effort but not extensive research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Diet choice may evoke mild personal beliefs, but there is little political or cultural pressure to favor one answer; minimal social desirability concerns.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; A’s numbers are easy to parse, B’s statement is concise. No dense jargon, though A’s false precision could mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Strong substantive contrast—A claims a specific universally effective diet, B denies any such diet exists—so differences are clear and significant.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Decision mainly about factual accuracy; no tough trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the responses are clear and differ meaningfully, some domain knowledge and critical thinking are required to spot A’s dubious claim. Combining factors yields moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person likely knows that “one‐size‐fits-all” diets are controversial; no deep technical expertise is needed to see that one answer hedges while the other makes a sweeping claim.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; the evaluator mainly decides which statement seems more plausible. Little in-depth analysis is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While diet topics can evoke personal beliefs, there is minimal political or cultural pressure; most people can state a preference without fear of judgment.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; terminology is familiar; no jargon. Misleading content exists in B, but it is still clearly expressed.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposing stances—“none works for everyone” vs. “low-carb works for everyone”—so the difference is very clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off; the main consideration is accuracy vs. confidence. No strong clash of moral or practical values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given modest knowledge needs, low cognitive load, clear contrast, and minimal value tension, most annotators will find it straightforward to express their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are moderate: to decide which answer is more accurate you need some idea that police may legally lie during interrogations while perjury is punishable, but this isn’t extremely specialized legal knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; evaluating them mostly involves a quick plausibility check, so mental effort is low-to-moderate.  
2.b 2

3.a Opinions about U.S. police could trigger some political/social feelings, but the task is simply to rate factual quality; pressure is limited.  
3.b 3

4.a Both answers are concise and plain-language; they’re easy to read, though B packs a lot into one long sentence.  
4.b 2

5.a They differ substantially (A: cops routinely lie; B: cops face punishment for any lie). The contrast is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-off between competing moral values is required; it’s mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an average person should find it fairly easy to voice a preference; only moderate knowledge and minimal analysis are needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Both answers talk about everyday notions—police lying, perjury, job discipline. An average adult can grasp these without legal expertise, though fine-grained accuracy might elude them.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   One response is a single sentence, the other a short paragraph. Comparing completeness and plausibility takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Opinions about police can be politicized, but here the annotator is only judging which answer is better, not giving a personal stance on policing. Social pressure is mild.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both are plain English. No jargon or convoluted phrasing; differences are easy to spot.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   Response A is minimal and vague; Response B is detailed and cites concrete consequences. The gap is substantive, making preference straightforward.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No real trade-offs (e.g., brevity vs. completeness isn’t a strong moral conflict).  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Minimal expertise, low cognitive load, clear distinctions, and little value tension make it easy to choose.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only a basic understanding that police may sometimes lie is needed; evaluating completeness doesn’t demand legal expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short, straightforward answers; comparing length, detail, and accuracy is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic can evoke opinions on policing, but the task is to judge informational quality, not endorse a stance; pressure is minor.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are clear, plain-language, and easy to read; minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B adds consequences and case-law context, while Response A is brief; the substantive difference is obvious.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs—mostly a question of thoroughness vs brevity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low across all factors; an annotator can readily pick the more informative response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person can judge that a fuller, on-topic answer is preferable over a one-sentence, tangential answer without needing legal expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; one response obviously addresses the prompt while the other largely doesn’t. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic involves policing but the choice is mainly about answer quality, not ideology. Minor potential bias, but limited.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both are easy to read; Response A is straightforward, Response B is terse but intelligible. Slight ambiguity in A’s accuracy, yet still clear.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ greatly in relevance and depth, making preference clear.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical values; simply choose the more informative answer.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining the low knowledge need, minimal effort, low bias, clear distinction, and no value conflict, it’s very easy to express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of current European cannabis laws is needed to judge which statement is more accurate; this isn’t common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The annotator only has to check which country/countries actually have legal cannabis, a single‐fact comparison; some quick thinking or a lookup suffices.  
2.b 2

3.a While opinions on cannabis can be politicized, merely choosing the more correct factual answer carries little social pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are short, plainly written, and easy to read; no jargon or dense argumentation.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (they name different “only” countries), so the distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s a straightforward factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1

7.a The main challenge is having enough factual knowledge; otherwise the task is simple. Overall, this puts the difficulty in the low-to-moderate range.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing which answer is better depends on knowing (or looking up) the actual legal status of cannabis across Europe. Most people do not track detailed drug-policy law, so some fairly specialized factual knowledge is required.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are brief, but deciding which is preferable means checking multiple country laws or at least spotting obvious errors in each. That takes moderate mental effort, though not exhaustive analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a While cannabis policy can be politically charged, the annotator is merely judging factual accuracy, not stating a personal stance on legalization; social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is simple and short; neither answer is convoluted. Misleading content exists, but it is easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers contradict each other on the core point (which countries allow weed). That is a substantive difference, not a superficial one.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because meaningful factual evaluation is needed and average knowledge may be lacking, but other complicating factors are low, overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Determining which response is better hinges on knowing the actual legal status of cannabis across Europe—facts that most people don’t track closely. Without this domain knowledge, an annotator can’t easily see that both answers are wrong.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Aside from fact-checking, the texts are short and straightforward. Still, looking up the real laws or recalling them adds non-trivial effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Cannabis policy can be somewhat controversial, but expressing a preference between two factual answers is unlikely to trigger strong social desirability pressures.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are clearly written and easy to parse, though they confidently state incorrect information. Clarity is good even if accuracy is not.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The responses differ in the single country they claim is legal and give slightly different justifications—this is a substantive difference, not a cosmetic one.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No major trade-offs between competing values are present; the main criterion is factual correctness.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because accuracy is the decisive factor yet requires specific knowledge, many annotators will struggle to decide which is preferable, even though the other evaluation aspects are simple.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator needs to know (or look up) the actual legal status of cannabis in Georgia and elsewhere in Europe. That information is not everyday common knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a two-sentence reply to a longer paragraph with extra specifics is not mentally taxing, though verifying factual accuracy does take some thinking or quick research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Cannabis legality can be politically charged, but simply picking the more accurate answer is unlikely to trigger strong social desirability pressures for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; the difference is primarily in length and detail, not readability.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is concise, the other detailed (and potentially inaccurate). This is a substantive difference that gives the annotator something real to weigh.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice may pit factual correctness against thoroughness—i.e., accuracy vs. completeness—so there is a mild trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While some factual knowledge is needed, the task remains fairly straightforward; moderate difficulty at most.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing the better response hinges on knowing current animal-cognition research—whether any species truly matches human addition ability. This is specialized but not extremely obscure; pop-science articles cover it.  
1.b 3

2.a The annotator only needs to check which statement is factually closer to reality and perhaps note tone; this is a simple factual comparison with little multi-step reasoning.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial and unlikely to trigger political, moral, or social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses diverge dramatically (apes can vs. no animal can), so differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values is involved; it's a straightforward accuracy question.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing moderate domain knowledge, all other factors make preference expression easy; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluator must know (or guess) facts about animal numerical cognition; not everyday trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only need to compare two brief, direct claims; little analysis beyond plausibility checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is scientifically neutral with no cultural or political sensitivity.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; Response B is longer but still clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One flatly denies animal addition ability, the other affirms it with detail—clear substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall; modest knowledge needed but little else impedes preference expression.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is more accurate hinges on knowing something about animal-cognition research (e.g., how well apes can really add). That’s not highly specialized neuroscience, but it isn’t everyday knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; no intricate arguments or numbers to verify. The mental work is mostly judging plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Few cultural or political pressures are tied to beliefs about ape arithmetic; unlikely to distort someone’s choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly worded. B is a bit longer but still straightforward; neither is jargon-heavy or confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims—“none can” vs. “apes can.” The distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing moral or practical values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from requiring some mid-level factual knowledge, the comparison is simple, with clear and readable answers and minimal bias issues.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to judge which statement about Italian Catholic practice is accurate. While not highly specialized, one must know (or suspect) real statistics on church attendance and self-identification; many average people may be unsure.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short; the annotator mainly checks plausibility of numbers and tone. Minimal cross-checking or deep analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Religion can carry some social sensitivity, but the prompt is factual rather than moral. Little pressure to favor one answer for ideological reasons.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are straightforward and grammatical; meanings are clear. No technical jargon, though Response B may mislead with confident but false figures. Clarity is still high.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ dramatically (one says “many Italians are not devout,” the other claims “Italy is one of the most devout nations”). The contrast is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-off between competing values; choice mostly hinges on factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are easy to read and clearly distinct, but require some real-world knowledge to judge accuracy, overall difficulty is modest but not trivial.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: Picking the better answer hinges on knowing (or at least guessing) the real proportion of Italians who attend Mass weekly. Those statistics aren’t common everyday knowledge but also aren’t highly technical; an average person could still judge based on plausibility.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive demand: One answer is long and statistic-heavy, the other extremely brief. Weighing “detailed but maybe wrong” vs. “vague but safe” is fairly quick; no deep analysis or external lookup is strictly necessary.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and social pressure: Religion can introduce some bias, but the question is factual rather than moral, so most annotators should feel free to choose whichever seems more accurate.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response clarity: Both are easy to read; A is verbose but coherent, B is short and plain. No convoluted language or hidden meaning.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences: The responses differ sharply—A gives precise (possibly dubious) numbers, B offers a minimal counter-statement. This makes the contrast obvious and significant.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts: There’s no real trade-off between competing values such as safety vs. honesty—just accuracy/detail versus brevity.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty: Aside from some uncertainty about the true statistics, choosing the preferred answer is straightforward; other factors don’t greatly complicate the decision.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic general knowledge about Italy and Catholicism is enough; no specialized expertise required to notice that Response A supplies data while Response B is just an assertion.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only a quick read-through and comparison of a short vs. a slightly longer answer is needed; limited mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Religion can evoke mild social or cultural biases, but the question is descriptive, not evaluative; pressure is modest.  
3.b 3  

4.a Both answers are grammatically clear; A gives statistics, B is a single sentence—neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a There is a meaningful difference: A offers evidence and nuance, B is terse and unsupported, so preferences can be expressed clearly.  
5.b 2  

6.a Minimal value trade-offs; perhaps choosing between thoroughness (A) and brevity (B), but stakes are low.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall, it should be fairly easy for a typical annotator to state a preference; only mild religious bias considerations add slight difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is correct you need at least a rough idea of church-attendance statistics in Italy; many people won’t know that weekly mass is well under 50%, so specialized factual knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements; judging them mainly involves deciding which looks more believable, not lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Religion can be sensitive, but the question is factual, not moral; little pressure on which reply to prefer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; figures in A are explicit, B is concise. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other—one says vast majority are devout, the other says minority. Clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight tension between thoroughness (A gives numbers) and likely accuracy (B is shorter). Still, no deep ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing hinges on having (or guessing) the correct facts; otherwise the task is simple. Moderate difficulty overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires only knowing that the USA is not in Europe; no specialized Nobel statistics needed to see B is off-topic.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing two one-sentence answers for geographic correctness is almost effortless.  
2.b 1

3.a Little or no social or political pressure; national pride is minimal here.  
3.b 1

4.a Both sentences are short and plain; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a One answer addresses the prompt; the other does not—clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the obvious mismatch in B, most people will quickly and confidently pick A.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of which European country actually leads in Nobel science prizes is not common trivia but also not extremely obscure; many people will be unsure without looking it up.  
1.b 3

2.a The annotator mainly has to judge which statement is factually correct. That may require a quick web search or recall, but otherwise comparison is straightforward.  
2.b 3

3.a Little social or cultural pressure is involved unless the annotator has strong national pride; generally a neutral fact-based topic.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give opposite factual claims, so the difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values; correctness is the only salient criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the main challenge is simply knowing (or verifying) the correct fact, the task is moderately difficult but not burdensome overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic geography (knowing the U.S. is not in Europe) and a rough idea that the U.K. leads Europe in Nobel science prizes.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; Response B is clearly off-topic, so little mental effort is required.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or socially sensitive; little risk of bias affecting the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response answers the question correctly and pertinently; the other names a non-European country, creating a stark contrast.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given minimal knowledge requirements and a clear error in one response, it is very easy to express a true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic geography and general awareness that the United States is not in Europe; no specialized Nobel-Prize statistics are required.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick—notice that one answer names a non-European country, so the other is likely preferable. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is factual and non-controversial; little room for political or social pressure to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short and easy to read, though Response A is clearly wrong; minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other on the core fact, so the difference is decisive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values are involved—only factual correctness matters.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual error in Response A and lack of complicating factors, choosing is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge requirements are minimal because mainstream news, documentaries, and everyday discussions often mention that algorithms can inherit bias from data.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison involves reading two short, straightforward statements and deciding which aligns with common understanding; little mental effort is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Social desirability actually makes it easier: current public discourse emphasizes awareness of algorithmic bias, so most people feel no stigma choosing Response B.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief, unambiguous, and easily understood, with opposite claims that are easy to contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ fundamentally—one denies bias, the other affirms it—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing moral values is presented; it’s simply a factual question about bias.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the low knowledge barrier, minimal cognitive load, clear wording, and lack of value conflict, expressing a genuine preference should be very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that ML can inherit bias from data is common in media/education; no deep technical knowledge needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short statements; judging which aligns with reality requires minimal reasoning.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the topic involves fairness, there is little personal or ideological pressure; most people feel safe agreeing algorithms can be biased.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plain-language; differences are easy to parse.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer affirms bias, the other denies it—substantive, opposite positions.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is factual, not a trade-off between competing values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort required; clear, meaningful contrast; low social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which list is correct, the annotator needs some idea of current GDP-per-capita standings or be able to sense that Venezuela’s numbers look suspicious. That takes more than everyday trivia but not deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparing four named countries and some numbers vs. a three-country list is quick. No calculations or long reading needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Country wealth rankings are not politically or morally charged for most people; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly worded. No jargon, ambiguous phrasing, or excessive length.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer is detailed (but likely inaccurate); the other is concise. The contrast in content and accuracy gives a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between detail and accuracy, but accuracy generally dominates, so conflict is limited.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some moderate factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; low social or cognitive barriers.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know—or quickly look up—basic current GDP-per-capita figures for South American countries. While not everyone memorizes exact numbers, it is reasonably common knowledge that Venezuela is presently in economic crisis, so spotting the inaccuracy does not demand deep expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is short; the other is a single paragraph. Comparing accuracy and completeness takes little time and no calculations.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is economic statistics, with limited ideological or cultural pressure. Mild political feelings about Venezuela might exist but are unlikely to inhibit honest judgment.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable and straightforward; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—one names Venezuela alone and gives details; the other lists three different countries. This substantive conflict in content makes choosing easier.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between kindness, safety, or other values—just accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands are modest, cognitive load is low, bias minimal, and differences clear, most annotators can confidently state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or quickly look up current GDP-per-capita data for South American countries; this is basic economic information that many people have heard (e.g., Venezuela’s crisis, Chile/Uruguay doing well).  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short lists to compare; evaluator mainly checks which list matches reality. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is economic statistics, not laden with sensitive social or political judgments (aside from mild opinions about Venezuela). Little risk of social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are one simple sentence, clearly stating three countries each. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Lists differ in one country (Argentina vs. Venezuela); this is a substantive factual difference, making preference easy.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values—just selecting the factually better answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low specialized knowledge and minimal cognitive demand; clear, meaningful distinction; little bias.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater needs to know (or look up) actual GDP-per-capita figures and realize that Venezuela is currently not among the richest. That economic fact isn’t common trivia but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a two-sentence list (B) with a longer paragraph (A) takes little effort; only modest reasoning is required to notice the added but possibly inaccurate numbers in A.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is economic statistics, with little ideological or cultural pressure attached. Personal biases are unlikely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly. A is longer but still readable; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A supplies explanatory context and specific dollar values, while B is a bare statement. These are more than cosmetic differences, but they revolve around the same (incorrect) country list, so the substantive distinction is moderate.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is thoroughness (A) versus risk of factual error (A vs. B). This is a mild conflict, not a major ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some economic knowledge helps, but the task is not intellectually taxing and involves little social bias or value tension. Choosing should be moderately easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which etymology is correct an annotator would need some familiarity with linguistic scholarship on the word or would have to research authoritative sources; most people do not possess this knowledge off-hand.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, but deciding which is better means weighing historical plausibility and perhaps checking references, so more than a quick skim yet not extremely taxing.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic involves an ethnic slur, but simply choosing the more accurate etymology is unlikely to evoke strong personal or social bias; no partisan or moral dilemma is present.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and easy to read; neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give completely different origins (guappo vs. acronym folklore), so the distinction is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision is essentially about factual accuracy; no competing moral or pragmatic values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the key challenge is possessing or finding the correct factual knowledge, while other factors are straightforward, expressing a true preference is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To know which explanation is historically accurate you need some specialized knowledge of etymology or immigration history; the common “without passport/papers” story is widespread but wrong, while the “guappo/thug” derivation is supported by scholars. An average person is unlikely to be certain.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The answers are short and easy to read, so the mental effort is mostly limited to deciding which one seems more plausible. No lengthy reasoning is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Although the topic involves an ethnic slur, choosing between two origin stories doesn’t strongly engage political or social identity. Minimal pressure to disguise one’s view.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are concise, grammatically clear, and directly answer the question; they’re easy to compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The explanations are mutually exclusive and substantively different, so a preference clearly matters.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
There is no real trade-off between competing values like honesty vs. kindness; the task is simply to pick the more accurate answer.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because determining accuracy requires uncommon background knowledge, but everything else (clarity, biases, cognitive load) is straightforward, expressing a true preference is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Average people would need some specific historical-linguistic knowledge to know that “wop” most likely comes from the Neapolitan word “guappo,” not from an English-language acronym.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are very short; comparing them takes little time or mental work beyond judging plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Although the slur is sensitive, deciding which explanation is better is unlikely to trigger major social-desirability pressure; the annotator only judges factual accuracy.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are brief and plainly written; no jargon or dense reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a One answer is vague and possibly correct; the other is detailed but presents a well-known folk etymology. The substantive content differs clearly.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the only salient criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing specialized etymological knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of value conflict, easy comparison) makes the choice straightforward, so overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Determining which answer is better hinges on knowing the true etymology of “wop,” something most people have never researched; specialized historical-linguistic knowledge is needed.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short and easy to scan; little mental work is required beyond noticing they say almost the same thing.  
2.b 2

3.a While the term itself is offensive, there is little social pressure about which chatbot answer to like; bias influence is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are clearly written, grammatically simple, and easy to compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantively, both give the same (folk) etymology; the only difference is that B supplies extra detail. Distinctions are mostly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a No serious trade-offs between competing values; the choice is mainly between brevity and thoroughness.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the answers are nearly identical and accuracy depends on non-common knowledge, an annotator may struggle to state a real preference, though the overall cognitive load is low.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic familiarity with well-known Internet pioneers or awareness that Al Gore did not “invent” the Internet is enough. Many people have encountered that fact in popular media; no deep technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One short, one longer answer. You mainly judge which is historically accurate—little analysis or outside research required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Al Gore is a political figure, so mild partisan feelings could creep in, but the topic is not highly charged and there is no stigma in preferring the accurate answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; neither uses jargon. B is longer but still straightforward. No tricks or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—one spreads a myth, the other gives a concise, more correct attribution—so the contrast is significant and easy to base a preference on.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to none. Accuracy clearly outweighs verbosity; no ethical or safety trade-offs.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias pressure, clear distinction, and no value conflict, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better you need to know (or look up) that the United Kingdom is no longer in the EU and that some current EU members (e.g., Denmark) do have at least modest oil reserves. That geography-and-energy knowledge is somewhat specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from the factual check described above, the comparison is straightforward; little multi-step reasoning is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (EU oil reserves) is not politically or socially charged for most people, so personal biases are unlikely to affect the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short, direct, and easy to read; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims (none vs. the UK has large reserves). This is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the main challenge is simply knowing the relevant facts about EU membership and oil reserves, the task is only moderately difficult.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are low; most people know at least vaguely that few EU members have large oil reserves, but they don’t need to know exact geology to see both answers say essentially the same thing.  
1.b 2  

2.a Little mental effort: one answer is a one-sentence claim, the other is the same claim with extra context. Comparing length and detail is straightforward.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is energy resources, which carries minimal personal or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and unambiguous; easy to read.  
4.b 1  

5.a The substantive content is almost identical; the only difference is elaboration vs. brevity, so distinctions are fairly superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a No obvious trade-offs between competing moral or practical values arise; it’s largely a style preference.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the answers are so similar, picking one may feel arbitrary, raising overall difficulty slightly, but other factors (clarity, neutrality) keep the task easy.  
7.b 3
1.a To know which answer is more accurate, the rater should be aware that bulls are not especially attracted to red; the cape’s color is mainly for tradition/showmanship. This is not highly specialized neuroscience, but it is also not universally known.  
1.b 3  

2.a Evaluating the two short replies takes little mental effort: they are brief and can be compared quickly for completeness and plausibility.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bullfighting color lore carries little political or cultural pressure for most people; biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable. A is longer but still straightforward; B is concise. Neither is confusing, though A may mislead with pseudo-technical detail.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ meaningfully: A gives a specific (but incorrect) physiological claim; B attributes the color to tradition without biological claims. The distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a No conflicting values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing moderate background knowledge, all other factors make selection easy, leading to low overall difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, the annotator must know (or look up) that bulls are largely insensitive to red and that the cape’s color is mainly for spectacle/​blood concealment. This is moderately specialized biology/cultural lore not universally known.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very brief statements; deciding involves a single factual comparison, not multi-step reasoning.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is culturally neutral; little risk of political or social desirability effects.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and plainly worded; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give completely different explanations (color sensitivity vs. hiding blood), so the contrast is substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is having (or lacking) the correct factual knowledge; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer depends on knowing that bulls charge the motion, not the color; many people hold the common myth, so some non-trivial factual knowledge is required but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; comparison involves little mental effort beyond checking which aligns with known facts.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial and carries no clear ideological or social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are grammatical and understandable, though B is flowery; neither is obscure.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers give conflicting explanations (movement vs. color), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the task is moderately easy; the main obstacle is whether the annotator knows the factual myth vs. reality.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which statement better answers the question, one must know that the ISS is in micro-gravity (free-fall) rather than having “no gravity” or normal surface gravity. That nuance goes beyond basic everyday knowledge, though it isn’t extremely esoteric.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are only one sentence each; comparing them takes little time and no calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely scientific and non-controversial; no political or cultural pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short and easy to read. They may be slightly misleading, but not confusing in wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two answers make opposite claims (“lack of gravity” vs. “gravity is evident”), so the contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are required—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing hinges mainly on knowing the micro-gravity fact; this presents moderate, but not high, difficulty for the average person. Other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 3
1.a Only basic understanding of gravity and orbit is needed; most people can grasp that both answers say gravity exists on the ISS.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing a one-sentence reply with a short explanatory paragraph takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a No political, cultural, or moral issues are involved; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are straightforward English; A is longer but still clear. No technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Difference is substantive (brief statement vs. fuller explanation), but both convey the same key fact; the distinction is mostly depth/detail.  
5.b 3  

6.a Minimal value tension—only a mild trade-off between brevity and thoroughness.  
6.b 2  

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low bias, and clear responses, expressing a preference is easy; only modest thought about depth vs. brevity is required.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluator only needs basic high-school understanding of orbital “micro-gravity” to see that one answer incorrectly says gravity is negligible, while the other correctly says gravity is present.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very short answers; deciding which is more accurate takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Purely scientific question with no cultural or political charge.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer says gravity is negligible/absent, the other says gravity causes floating—substantive disagreement.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; simply choose the scientifically correct reply.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall; slight knowledge and cognitive effort, but otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are minimal; an average person with common-sense ideas about digestion or late-night snacking can judge which answer sounds more plausible.  
1.b 2  

2.a The comparison is straightforward: one reply is short and absolute, the other is longer and nuanced. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged, so social desirability pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both texts are short, plainly written, and easy to read; no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a The responses differ substantially: nuanced vs. oversimplified. The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values; no ethical or emotional tension involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all low and differences are clear, expressing a true preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator would need some understanding of nutrition science to judge which claim is more accurate (circadian rhythm, leptin, weight gain). That goes a bit beyond everyday knowledge but isn’t highly specialized medical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; reading and contrasting them takes little time. Some extra thought is needed to recall or look up facts, but overall mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is only mildly tied to diet culture; there is little political or social pressure to favor one answer. Bias influence is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is clear. Response A uses a few technical terms but remains understandable; Response B is very concise. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give opposite conclusions (causes weight gain vs. little effect), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No conflicting values like safety vs. privacy; it’s purely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Choosing boils down to deciding which factual claim seems truer; requires moderate knowledge but low effort otherwise, with clear differences and little bias pressure. Overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Requires some understanding of nutrition science (e.g., metabolism, calorie balance) to judge which categorical claim is closer to reality, but this topic is familiar to many laypeople via media and common advice.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, opposing statements to weigh; limited mental processing needed beyond judging plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Minor diet-culture norms might sway opinions, but no strong political or cultural pressure; most people feel free to state their view.  
3.b 2

6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Limited knowledge burden and simple, clear choices with minimal bias or value conflict make preference expression fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person needs some understanding of nutrition science to know whether claims about circadian rhythms and insulin sensitivity are accurate. Not extremely technical, but beyond basic common knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; deciding mainly hinges on judging plausibility, which takes limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Diet timing is not strongly tied to political or cultural bias; little social pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and readable; Response A contains one technical statistic but is still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite conclusions, so distinctions are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are pitted against each other.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge need but otherwise clear, low-pressure comparison; overall selection is fairly easy.

1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; spotting which one is more plausible takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and not socially sensitive; little risk of bias or pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written with small numbers of technical terms; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The claims diverge drastically (negligible vs. catastrophic), so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or social values are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear writing, and starkly different content, it is very easy for an annotator to express a true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that 10 feet is negligible compared with 93 million miles is basic high-school–level science/common sense; no advanced astronomy needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick—one answer is concise and reasonable, the other gives implausible, exaggerated numbers; little analysis required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is purely scientific without political or cultural overtones, so biases rarely influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and readable; no jargon. Only minor issue is Response A’s misleading certainty, but clarity itself is fine.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses diverge substantially—one says “catastrophic change,” the other says “no significant effect.” Easy to spot the difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing ethical or personal values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive effort, neutral topic, clear contrast; most annotators can express a preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic scientific reasoning (understanding the vast Earth-Sun distance) is helpful but not specialized; most people can sense that 10 ft is negligible.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a quick plausibility check and comparison are needed; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is neutral with no political or cultural stakes, so bias or social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, direct, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ starkly (negligible effect vs. catastrophic effect), giving clear grounds for preference.  
5.b 1

6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge requirements, minimal cognitive load, clarity, and clear differences, expressing a true preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs basic scale sense (10 ft vs 93 million mi) or high-school astronomy to know the effect is negligible; no deep expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing the two short statements and recalling a simple order-of-magnitude fact is quick; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is purely physical/astronomical, with no political or social stakes, so biases or social pressure are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ starkly (negligible change vs. global catastrophe), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at play; it’s just accuracy vs. inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge/cognitive requirements, high clarity, and no value conflicts, choosing is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge needed is just basic awareness that Mandarin is common and that multiple languages exist in China; most people can judge which answer is more informative without specialized linguistics expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison mainly involves noticing that Response B gives specifics while Response A is minimal; little mental effort required.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is not politically or morally charged for most evaluators; unlikely to trigger strong social-desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; B is longer but still straightforward. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The two responses differ clearly in depth and usefulness, so the distinction is significant, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No obvious trade-off between competing values; one response is simply fuller.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge barrier, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and clear, meaningful differences, expressing a true preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, one only needs the fairly common knowledge that China has many regional languages/dialects (e.g., Cantonese, Shanghainese, minority languages).  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is straightforward—one answer is short and modest, the other long and emphatic. Little analysis is needed beyond noticing accuracy.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not especially sensitive; there is little political or social pressure affecting the choice for most annotators.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are written clearly; length and tone differ, but neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A gives an elaborate (and factually wrong) claim that all Chinese speak Mandarin; Response B gives a concise, more accurate statement. The difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved—accuracy is obviously preferred.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive effort, little bias, and clear substantive differences, expressing a true preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, one must know that not all Chinese people actually speak Putonghua; this is somewhat beyond common knowledge but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to read; comparison mainly about brevity vs. embellished wording. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is linguistically factual and not politically charged for most annotators; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are clear; B is flowery but still understandable. No ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical (both claim universality of Putonghua); differences are largely stylistic, so picking a preference may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between conciseness (A) and detail/verbosity (B), but no serious competing values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers convey the same (incorrect) claim and differ mostly in style, while requiring some extra knowledge to spot the inaccuracy, expressing a clear preference is moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is better, an annotator only needs a rough sense that Japan’s obesity rate is lower than China’s, or can simply rely on internal plausibility; no deep expertise or technical data is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is a single sentence, the other a short paragraph with a statistic. Comparing accuracy, completeness, and style is quick and does not require extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most readers, so there is little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; Response B is longer but still clear. There is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B provides a specific percentage and brief explanation, whereas Response A is minimal. The difference (detail vs. brevity) is substantive enough to make a clear choice.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision does not force a trade-off between competing moral or practical values; it’s mainly about detail vs. conciseness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, little bias, clear content, and a substantive but simple difference, most annotators can easily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is better depends on knowing (or guessing) which comparison country is factually correct; obesity-rate data are not common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
One response is a single sentence; the other is longer with numbers and an explanation. Comparing them mostly involves deciding which seems more accurate/appropriate, a modest effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
There is little political or cultural sensitivity in preferring Vietnam vs. France as a comparison; minimal bias pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are readable; Response B is longer but still comprehensible. No tricky wording or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They differ clearly in content (Vietnam vs. France) and in level of detail, so annotators have substantive distinctions on which to base a choice.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
The trade-off is mainly brevity vs. detail/possible misinformation—minor compared with moral or safety dilemmas.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is neutral, the responses are clear, and the main challenge is modest factual knowledge, most people would find it fairly easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of relative obesity rates among major countries is fairly common; many people know the United States is highly obese, so realizing that “China exceeds the U.S.” is dubious. No deep expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a quick plausibility check is needed; there is little to analyze beyond which statement seems factually correct.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or morally charged for most annotators; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatically clear, and directly comparable.  
4.b 1

5.a They differ in a substantive factual claim (India vs. United States), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are presented; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge demand, low cognitive effort, minimal bias, high clarity, and clear differences, expressing a preference should be easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate you need some familiarity with pharmacology (LSD kinetics, myths about it “staying in the spine”). Many laypeople lack this; they might even have heard the false “permanent” myth and be unsure.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from needing background knowledge, comparing these two brief statements is simple; little reading or multi-step reasoning.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Drug-related topics can be sensitive, but there is little political or moral pressure in merely choosing the factual response.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and grammatically clear, though A uses some scientific words; still easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers conflict sharply (permanent vs. ~72 h). The difference is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is possessing enough correct knowledge to know which statement is plausible; otherwise the choice is easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Distinguishing which answer is more accurate requires some pharmacology/toxicology background; most people don’t know how long LSD actually remains in the body or that the “stays-in-your-spine” idea is a myth.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, so judging them doesn’t demand much reading or multi-step reasoning, but you still have to weigh conflicting scientific claims.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little social pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both statements are concise and grammatically clear; there’s little ambiguity in what each is asserting.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers diverge sharply (hours vs. months-to-years), so the difference is very substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are posed; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because you need specialized knowledge to judge the conflicting factual claims but other factors are straightforward, the overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements: One must know factual information about LSD metabolism and the myth that it “stays in your spine.” This is somewhat specialized pharmacology knowledge but is also discussed in popular drug-education materials.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short, direct statements to compare; little reading or analysis effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: The topic is medically factual, with no obvious political or moral pressure influencing preference.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are brief and plainly worded, though B is slightly longer. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers give opposite claims (48 hours vs. indefinite permanence), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-off between values; it’s purely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Apart from needing correct drug-metabolism knowledge, the task is straightforward; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, the annotator needs some pharmacology background or at least awareness that the “LSD stays in your spine for years” story is a myth.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements; once a person knows (or thinks they know) the fact, deciding is quick. Little analytical work beyond fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Drugs can be a sensitive topic, but there is no strong political or moral angle that would pressure someone to favor one answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short, grammatically clear, and easy to compare; no jargon beyond “half-life” and “psychopharmacology.”  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially (hours vs. years/flashbacks), so the annotator has a real choice.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values like safety vs. honesty; it’s simply a factual accuracy question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is having the correct scientific knowledge; otherwise the task is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would ideally know that no vegetable (including spinach) has been “proven” to add decades to life. That takes some health-science literacy but not deep technical expertise—many laypeople may already suspect the claim is false.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is mostly about deciding whether the longer, more detailed story in Response B is more convincing than the brief claim in Response A. This doesn’t require extensive analysis or outside resources; it’s a quick credibility check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (spinach and longevity) is neutral; there’s little political, cultural, or moral pressure that would distort someone’s stated preference.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written in plain language. Response B is wordier but still easy to follow. There’s no technical jargon that obscures meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The substantive content (spinach extends life) is identical; the main difference is the level of detail and the (fabricated) citation in B. Thus the distinction is somewhat superficial but not entirely—one is concise, the other elaborates and may mislead more.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: There’s only a mild trade-off (brevity vs. thoroughness/false authority). No deep clash between important values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands are moderate and other factors are low, most people could comfortably express a preference, so overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To recognize that neither answer is scientifically sound and that no vegetable is “proven” to add decades of life, one needs some familiarity with how nutrition research works, but an average person may still suspect exaggeration. Moderate but not specialized knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short claim with a longer, more detailed-sounding but still dubious claim doesn’t require lengthy analysis; one mainly judges plausibility and evidence quality.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (vegetables and longevity) is non-controversial and free from political or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; Response B is longer yet straightforward. Misleading content doesn’t make them hard to understand.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give the same bottom-line claim (“tomatoes extend life”) but differ in the amount of purported evidence and detail, so the distinction is somewhat but not hugely substantive.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight tension between valuing brevity (A) and valuing thoroughness/evidence (B) that might be false. Not a strong moral trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low-to-moderate difficulty; little bias or cognitive load, modest knowledge needed, some but limited meaningful difference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing correctly mainly demands a basic grasp of how U.S. marginal tax brackets work—knowledge many adults possess or can recall. It does not require professional-level tax expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The answers are short; you only need to notice which one describes marginal taxation accurately. Little mental juggling or outside research is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
While taxes can be politically charged, this specific question is factual, not ideological. There is minimal risk that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are written plainly. Sentences are simple; terminology is familiar. Misinterpretation is unlikely, though Response A is slightly vague.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The responses contradict each other on whether take-home pay falls or rises. The difference is stark and substantive, making preference selection straightforward.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are in play; it is purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because only modest knowledge and low effort are required, biases are minimal, and the responses differ clearly, most people can easily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know how marginal U.S. income tax works (only the income within each bracket is taxed at that bracket’s rate). This is not highly technical, but many people are fuzzy on it, so some specific tax knowledge is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two brief sentences to compare; deciding mainly rests on judging factual correctness. Minimal mental effort beyond recalling tax basics.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While taxes are politically charged, the question is factual rather than value-laden; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and plainly worded; no jargon. Easily read and compared.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers conflict fundamentally—Response A asserts overall take-home may drop, Response B explains marginal taxation. Distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values; simply picking the more accurate explanation.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing the better response is mainly a matter of possessing correct but moderate tax knowledge; other factors pose little obstacle.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing accurately requires understanding how U.S. marginal tax brackets actually work (only the additional income is taxed at the higher rate). That’s somewhat above everyday knowledge, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are very short, so reading effort is minimal; the main task is judging correctness, which is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is mildly political but not strongly tied to identity or social desirability for most people. Little pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both statements are readable; A is longer but clear, B is terse. No real ambiguity, though B’s vagueness might hinder comparison slightly.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ in length, detail, and content accuracy, so distinctions are meaningful rather than superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No major value trade-offs; it’s mostly about correctness vs. brevity.  
6.b 2

7.a Moderate tax-knowledge need is the main hurdle; otherwise comparison is easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must understand the U.S. marginal-rate system to see that B is wrong and A is right, but that concept is fairly well-known and not highly technical.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short answers; the main task is spotting the conceptual error in B. Little reading or calculation required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Taxes can be political, but the prompt asks for a factual mechanism, not an ideological stance, so minimal pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Wording in both replies is straightforward; no jargon. Misstatement in B is easy to recognize if one understands taxes.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Difference is substantive—A says only the extra portion is taxed higher; B claims overall take-home shrinks, implying you could be worse off than before. Clear contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values; it’s simply a matter of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires only modest tax knowledge and minimal effort; biases and value conflicts are low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To decide which answer is better, a rater benefits from knowing (or quickly checking) a few facts about Irish censorship, but even without that knowledge the specificity of Response B versus the vagueness of Response A makes the choice fairly clear.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; the comparison is mostly “specific vs. vague,” so little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Book-banning is not especially charged for most readers, and there is no obvious political or cultural pressure pushing toward one answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; Response A is terse but plain, Response B is longer yet straightforward. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantially—one names almost nothing, the other gives a concrete example and context—so differences are easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values; accuracy and informativeness are aligned.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Limited required knowledge, low cognitive load, little bias, clear and meaningfully different answers—all make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person does not need specialized knowledge; it is obvious that a one-sentence answer naming an obscure “Jean Martin” is less informative than a fuller list.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very little effort is required to notice that Response B is longer and seemingly more informative than Response A.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The question is not politically or culturally sensitive; no major bias pressure in choosing either answer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read. Response A is terse but clear; Response B is clear and coherent. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The differences are large—one answer is almost empty, the other provides multiple examples and background.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like safety vs. helpfulness or honesty vs. kindness are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining the above, it is straightforward for an annotator to prefer the more informative Response B.  
7.b 1
1.a Selecting the better answer largely hinges on knowing (or being able to guess) which titles are actually banned in Ireland, something most people don’t know.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from the knowledge gap, the mental work is limited—there are only two short replies to compare—so effort is moderate.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is mildly sensitive (censorship, sexual content) but not highly politicized; social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no complex jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially (one specific, contextualised example vs. a single-sentence claim), so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values need to be weighed.  
6.b 1

7.a While evaluating accuracy is tricky, all other factors are simple; overall, expressing a preference is only moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer better reflects UK law, a rater should know (or sense) that child-sexual-abuse images are certainly illegal while business call recording is usually regulated but not automatically “illegal.” This needs some familiarity with UK legal basics but not deep, technical expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Both answers are very short; comparing them, spotting incompleteness or inaccuracy, and forming a preference can be done quickly without extensive analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic is largely non-political. Protecting children is universally endorsed; nothing here forces a socially sensitive stance.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Sentences are simple and easy to read; no jargon. Minor ambiguity (“in any context”) in A, but still understandable.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers give entirely different kinds of “illegal recordings,” so the contrast is clear and substantive, not just stylistic.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing moral or practical values are pitted against each other; just decide which factual claim is more responsive/correct.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the content is brief, clear, and value-neutral, and only modest legal knowledge is needed, most annotators will find it easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of UK copyright law helps identify that both answers are wrong and that B is only slightly closer to the truth. A casual reader might still manage by relying on common‐sense notions about “unauthorized” copying, but some legal familiarity is useful.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; deciding mostly involves asking “Which one sounds more plausible?” Little cross-checking or long reasoning is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not socially charged; little chance of political or cultural pressure influencing selection.  
3.b 1

4.a Language is plain and easy to follow, though B contains a misleading claim about mandatory registration. Comprehension is still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are clear and substantive (blanket prohibition vs. prohibition of unauthorized copying).  
5.b 1

6.a No obvious trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some domain knowledge, the task is simple: responses are brief, differences obvious, and no social/value pressures complicate the choice.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must understand what “legal tender” actually means in U.S. law; many lay people erroneously believe cash acceptance is mandatory, so some non-trivial legal/economic knowledge helps pick the correct answer.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, straightforward statements; once the factual point is known, comparison is easy.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly worded; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—one says “no requirement,” the other says “must accept cash.” Clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or pragmatic values; it’s purely a factual correctness issue.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the correct legal knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, clear difference) makes preference expression easy; difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator should know (or quickly look up) what U.S. “legal-tender” law actually says. That is somewhat specialized: many people vaguely think cash must be accepted.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison mostly involves reading one short sentence versus a short paragraph and noticing a possible misquotation in B. Limited effort, but a little fact-checking helps.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is technical and not politically charged; little chance of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; A is very concise, B is longer but understandable, though its quoted wording could mislead. Mild clarity issue.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is a bare statement; B adds reasoning and a (possibly incorrect) quote. The difference (simplicity vs. detailed but dubiously accurate) is substantive enough to matter.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No tension between competing moral or practical values—just accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest legal knowledge and light fact-checking, but otherwise straightforward; minimal bias, clear distinctions.  
7.b 2
1.a To judge which list is more accurate, the annotator must know (or quickly verify) which laureates were actually American; e.g., realizing Niels Bohr was Danish and not American. This is factual but not everyday knowledge for everyone.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two brief answers to compare; outside of checking the factual nationality, little reasoning is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Physics laureates’ nationalities carry no political or cultural sensitivity for most people, so bias or social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatically clear, and easy to read; no ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ clearly on content accuracy (Bohr is wrong, Feynman/Gell-Mann are correct), so distinctions are substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from needing moderate factual knowledge (criterion 1), the choice is straightforward; hence overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is limited to recognizing whether the listed physicists are actually American Nobel laureates. Most people know Einstein and Bohr were not (or not clearly) American, so only modest factual familiarity is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing a short list of names and spotting obvious factual errors requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is apolitical and value-neutral; social desirability plays no role.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are brief and readable; there is no complex jargon. B is factually wrong but not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially: A is factually correct, B contains significant nationality errors. The distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because factual correctness is easy to judge and no biases or value conflicts arise, an annotator should find the choice straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a To decide, the annotator must know (or quickly recall) which Nobel laureates in Physics are considered American. Recognizing that Einstein’s prize preceded his U.S. citizenship and seeing the misspelled but correct-enough “Murray Gell-Man[n]” takes some, but not deep, factual knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison mostly involves counting names and spotting the factual nuance about Einstein’s citizenship timeline; that’s a small amount of reasoning, not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is historically neutral; little chance of political or cultural pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and easy to follow; no dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a They differ in number of examples and factual accuracy, giving a clear substantive basis for preference. Differences are not merely stylistic.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just factual correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing modest factual knowledge, the comparison is straightforward, with low bias and clear differences; overall selection difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding mainly hinges on knowing (or sensing) which city is usually colder in winter. This is general‐interest geography/climate knowledge, not specialist expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is just one sentence; the other is a short paragraph. Comparing correctness and completeness is quick; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather comparison is not politically or culturally charged, so biases or social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response A is detailed but still straightforward; Response B is extremely brief. No convoluted language.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers conflict directly (opposite claims) and differ in depth (detailed vs. terse). These are clear, substantive differences.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values; accuracy is the obvious deciding factor.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, no bias, clear differences, and no value conflicts, most annotators could state their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One does not need specialized meteorological knowledge; basic awareness that winters differ in temperature is enough to judge which answer seems fuller or more useful.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a brief read-through is necessary. Response A is a paragraph, Response B is a single sentence; comparison is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral (weather); no political, cultural, or moral pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are understandable. A is longer but still clear; no jargon beyond simple climate terms.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially—A gives temperatures and context; B is a one-line statement. The distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal. The trade-off is detail vs brevity, but this is not a deep value struggle.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given neutral content, clear difference in informativeness, and low cognitive load, selecting a preferred response is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic world-knowledge about relative winter climates of two well-known cities is needed; no technical expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Each response is a single sentence; deciding which feels more accurate or preferable is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Climate comparisons carry no sensitive political or cultural baggage; little chance that bias or social pressure sways the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both sentences are short, grammatical, and unambiguous, making them easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a The answers give opposite claims (one says Paris is harsher, the other says Philadelphia is colder and snowier); differences are substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a matter of which statement seems correct.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, ambiguity, and value conflicts are all minimal and the differences are clear, expressing a true preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator must actually know (or look up) typical winter temperatures in Paris and Philadelphia. Many people don’t have that fact at hand.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from the factual check, comparison is simple—one reply is very short, the other longer. Little mental juggling beyond judging correctness.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Climate facts aren’t politically or culturally charged, so biases and social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear. Response A is longer but still understandable; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other (Paris colder vs. warmer) and differ greatly in detail, so the distinction is obvious and consequential.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: A choice might pit accuracy against thoroughness (short-and-correct vs. detailed-but-wrong), but that is a relatively mild trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some factual knowledge, but otherwise straightforward with little bias or complexity.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires knowing the specific Catholic doctrine that “Immaculate Conception” refers to Mary’s conception without original sin (not Jesus’ virgin birth). That’s moderately specialized religious knowledge, though commonly discussed.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a brief comparison of two short statements; once you know the doctrine, the choice is easy.  
2.b 2

3.a Religion can introduce mild bias, but here the issue is definition accuracy, not personal belief, so social pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief and written plainly; there’s no ambiguity in what each claims.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give clearly different, mutually exclusive explanations—difference is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs like honesty vs. kindness; it’s simply which is correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the only real challenge is possessing the correct doctrinal knowledge, most other factors are straightforward; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing the specific Catholic doctrine that “Immaculate Conception” refers to Mary’s conception, not Jesus’. That is somewhat specialized religious knowledge that many people lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing the two answers requires little analysis beyond spotting which one matches the correct definition, once you know it. Mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a While religion can evoke some sensitivities, there is minimal social pressure here; most annotators can state a preference without fear of judgment.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief and easy to read, though A contains more prose. Neither is ambiguous; the main difference is factual accuracy.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses diverge sharply—one gives the common misconception, the other the doctrinal definition—so differences are highly meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are present; this is simply correctness vs. incorrectness.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the task is only moderately difficult. If the annotator lacks the specific theological fact, choosing becomes guesswork, but otherwise it is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is better you must realize that “Immaculate Conception” refers to Mary’s sinless conception, not Jesus’s virgin birth—a point many people confuse. That takes some specific familiarity with Catholic doctrine.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, and the contrast (long but wrong vs. short but correct) is easy to spot once you know the fact; little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While religion can evoke bias, simply picking the more accurate definition is not especially fraught; most people feel little social pressure here.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written. Response A is longer but comprehensible; Response B is concise. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer provides an incorrect explanation with extra detail; the other is brief and correct. That is a substantial difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits thoroughness/eloquence (A) against factual accuracy/concision (B). Some may weigh these differently, creating a mild value trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—accuracy hinges on a somewhat specialized fact, but otherwise the comparison is straightforward with limited bias or cognitive load.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the correct reply depends on knowing the true etymology of “wiki,” which many—but not all—people may have encountered. It is not esoteric scholarship, yet it is not universally known either.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short and straightforward; once the annotator knows (or thinks they know) the fact, comparison is quick. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is purely factual and carries no political, cultural, or moral weight, so biases or social-desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and unambiguous; nothing is convoluted or technical, so understanding each response is easy.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ fundamentally: one says it is not an acronym, the other claims a specific acronym. The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are present; it’s merely a correctness judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from needing to know (or look up) the true origin, everything else is effortless. Moderate knowledge requirement but low demands elsewhere make overall difficulty low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers relate to common internet trivia; average users likely know or can quickly infer that “wiki” isn’t an acronym.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward—decide whether one prefers the short, bare-bones statement (A) or the fuller explanation (B). Little analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral stakes.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are short, grammatical, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B supplies extra context and an origin story, while Response A is minimal. That is a substantive difference in helpfulness, making preference clear.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Virtually none—more detail vs. brevity is a mild preference, not a deep value trade-off.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low difficulty; an annotator can easily favor the more informative answer without specialized knowledge or moral pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know or quickly verify the real etymology of “wiki.” This isn’t highly specialized linguistics, but it’s not common trivia either.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; comparison is quick. Only modest thought is needed to spot that one is an acronym claim and the other is not.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No political, cultural, or moral stakes. Little chance of social desirability influence.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous. A is longer but still understandable; neither is convoluted.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other on a factual point (acronym vs. Hawaiian word). That is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No obvious trade-offs like safety vs. helpfulness; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing depends mainly on whether the annotator knows the correct fact; otherwise it’s straightforward. Moderate knowledge need, low other burdens.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs basic familiarity with who is actually prohibited from marrying in the UK (e.g., knowing that grandparents/grandchildren are also barred). This is somewhat beyond everyday trivia but still fairly common-sense; no deep legal expertise is required.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two concise answers; one simply lists three relatives, the other lists six and cites the statute. Deciding which is more accurate/comprehensive is quick and involves minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Incest prohibitions are broadly accepted and non-politicized; little risk that social desirability pressures will skew preferences.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable and straightforward; Response A is wordier but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference (comprehensive legal citation vs. short partial list) is substantive because it affects correctness; not just a style variation.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs like honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. utility are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge burden, minimal cognitive load, clear text, and substantive differences, most annotators could easily express a genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To know which answer is better, the annotator must know that first-cousin marriage is actually legal in the UK and be aware of the true list of prohibited relatives. That legal detail is not common knowledge.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Beyond simple reading, the annotator would need to fact-check both answers to discover they are equally wrong. That adds moderate mental effort but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The topic is largely neutral; there is little political or social stigma attached to preferring either brief or detailed misinformation.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to understand; no ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Substantively, the answers say the same incorrect thing; the only difference is that Response A adds irrelevant legal detail. This makes it hard to find a meaningful basis for preference.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-offs between competing values are invoked; both fail on accuracy in the same way.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because both responses are clear yet equally incorrect and differ only superficially, and because specialized knowledge is needed to notice the inaccuracy, an annotator will find it fairly hard to express a justified preference.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs common‐sense knowledge that true “photographic memory” is extremely rare; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence claim with an elaborated—but still obviously incorrect—claim takes little mental effort; no calculations or deep reading required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and not socially sensitive, so little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; Response A is longer but still clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both give the same incorrect conclusion (“very common”). Differences are mostly in length and spurious detail, so deciding which is “better” may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal conflict—main trade-off is between brevity (B) and misleading quantitative detail (A), but no deep ethical clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the topic and texts are simple, both responses are wrong, and the meaningful differences are slight, making preference expression moderately challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic (how common photographic memory is) is covered by basic popular-science knowledge; most people have at least a general sense it’s rare.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, direct statements to compare; no need for detailed fact-checking or logical reconstruction.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No political, cultural, or moral stakes—little chance of social desirability influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are brief and unambiguous; meanings are easy to grasp.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers flatly contradict each other (unprecedented vs. many have mastered), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; decision rests purely on perceived factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive effort, clear contrast, and no value or bias complications make preference expression straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator needs to know (or guess) that true photographic memory is extraordinarily rare, not “common” or “1 in 5.” That’s somewhat specialized but not highly technical psychological knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparing them takes little time. Some thought is needed to spot the fabricated statistics in A, but overall mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral—no political, cultural, or moral loading. Little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plain English. A is longer but still easy to read; neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Main difference is detail: A gives specific (false) statistics and a citation; B is a bare assertion. Both convey the same bottom-line claim (“it’s common”), so the substantive difference is limited.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-offs. One might weigh detail vs. brevity, but no deep conflict between competing values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate factual knowledge but little else; other factors are straightforward. Selecting a preferred answer should be relatively easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One need only understand the common meaning of “photographic memory” and notice that one answer is vague while the other provides concrete facts; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence, content-poor reply with a detailed, informative one is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; no social desirability pressures are involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; the main difference is that A is uninformative. There is no complex wording or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses are markedly different—one almost empty, the other substantive—so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at play.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge requirement, minimal cognitive effort, absence of bias, and clear substantive difference, selecting a preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that “X” comes from the Greek letter Chi is not extremely obscure, but it isn’t universal knowledge; likewise, judging whether “Xmas” is mainly secular vs. religious requires some light historical/cultural awareness.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare; no complex arguments or data to verify.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild potential religious sensitivity (some Christians dislike “Xmas”), but the stakes are low and social pressure minimal.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and straightforward; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give clearly different explanations (secular distancing vs. historical abbreviation), making the distinction easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No serious trade-offs between competing values; it’s mostly about which factual explanation one prefers.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires limited background knowledge and low mental effort; slight religious bias factor, but generally easy for annotators to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only a basic familiarity with the common abbreviation “Xmas” and its contested religious meaning is helpful; no deep historical or linguistic expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph requires little mental effort; the evaluator mainly judges completeness and accuracy.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic touches on religion vs. secularization, so personal beliefs or desire to appear respectful of faith could sway the choice, but pressure is moderate, not overwhelming.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable; A is very brief but unambiguous, B is longer yet straightforward. No dense jargon or convoluted logic.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge substantially—A asserts “Xmas” preserves the essence, B claims it secularizes and dilutes it—making preference distinctions obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only mild tension between religious sensitivity and linguistic accuracy; most annotators won’t feel a strong dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear differences, and only moderate bias issues, most people can state their true preference fairly easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Only common knowledge about abbreviations and tone is needed; no specialized expertise is required to decide which answer one prefers.  
1.b 1  

2.a The responses are short; contrasting them requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic touches on religion and could trigger personal or social-desirability biases (e.g., not wanting to seem “anti-Christian” or intolerant). Still, the pressure is moderate rather than extreme.  
3.b 3  

4.a Both replies are easy to read; A is wordier but not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ starkly in content and tone—one is judgmental, the other neutral—so the contrast is very meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a Some users may weigh thoroughness (A offers an argument) against civility/accuracy (B is concise and non-judgmental), creating a mild value trade-off.  
6.b 3  

7.a Considering the clear difference, low knowledge load, and limited cognitive effort, most annotators can express their genuine preference without much difficulty, though mild religious bias concerns add a little friction.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Need only basic awareness that Germany uses the euro and Sweden uses the krona; fairly common travel knowledge  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Simply checking which answer lists the correct currencies; little mental effort  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Neutral factual question; no social or cultural pressure involved  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short, grammatical, and unambiguous  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A lists both euro and krona, whereas Response B lists only euro; the difference is substantive (correct vs. partly incorrect)  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; straightforward correctness issue  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering the simple factual nature, clarity, and lack of biases, selecting a preferred response should be very easy for most people  
7.b 1
1.a Only basic geographical/currency awareness is needed; many travelers or news readers know Sweden still uses the krona. No specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating means spotting that one answer lists two currencies while the other (incorrectly) lists only the euro; little mental effort or comparison length.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is neutral with no political or cultural sensitivity, so bias or social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and plainly worded; content is understandable, though one is factually wrong. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are highly substantive—one response is correct, the other incorrect—giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; simply pick the accurate response.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge threshold, minimal effort, neutrality, clarity, and clear factual difference, most people would find it very easy to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic understanding of diabetes and sweets helps, but most people know at least that moderation is possible; no deep medical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short answers; deciding which seems more reasonable or helpful is quick and does not require lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is largely medical, with little political or cultural baggage; few social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; B is longer and a bit alarmist but still understandable. No hidden complexities.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially—one permissive, one extremely cautionary—so preferences can be expressed clearly.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between reassurance (A) and safety/precaution (B), but not a profound ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall difficulty; moderate knowledge and minimal effort suffice to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is better, an annotator has to know (or research) whether cell-phone RF energy can ignite gasoline vapors—a bit of technical safety lore the average person may be unsure about.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; deciding mainly involves checking plausibility and completeness, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mundane and apolitical; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable and concise, though A is slightly longer. No convoluted language or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The explanations diverge significantly (electromagnetic ignition vs. distraction), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit major competing values against each other; it’s mostly accuracy vs. brevity.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some technical knowledge to spot the misinformation in Response A, the comparison is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better mainly hinges on knowing whether cell-phone use actually creates an explosion hazard or whether the issue is just station policy. This is mildly technical but still common “urban-myth” knowledge; most people have heard discussions about it.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence each; comparison does not require lengthy reading or extra research.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is safety at gas stations—largely free of political, cultural, or moral pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short, direct, and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give distinctly different rationales (rule compliance vs. explosion danger). The difference is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major values against each other; it’s mostly about factual accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, short answers, minimal bias, and only modest knowledge needed, selecting a preferred response should be fairly easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator has to know (or suspect) that the “cell-phones-cause-explosions” story is an urban myth and that Response B invents facts. That takes some moderate, but not highly specialized, knowledge about basic physics and safety myths.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; comparing them for completeness, accuracy, and plausibility is quick. Limited mental workload.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Gas-station safety is not politically or culturally charged; little risk that personal or social biases will sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically simple. Response A is extremely brief; Response B is longer but still easy to read. No dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—minimal vs. detailed; different rationales; one likely inaccurate. The difference is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of which explanation is better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low bias, low cognitive load, clear differences, and only moderate knowledge required, most annotators can express a true preference without much trouble.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both explanations relate to everyday safety ideas; no specialized technical understanding is needed to see which reason feels more convincing.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two one-sentence answers; an annotator can weigh them in seconds.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; little risk of political or social bias influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is simple and unambiguous in both replies.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Each response offers a distinct rationale (fire hazard vs. distraction), so the contrast is real rather than superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are pitted against one another.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Clear, low-stakes decision with minimal knowledge or effort required; most annotators could readily state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs general common-sense geography/weather knowledge to recognize that it never literally rains all the time anywhere and that “England is constantly drenched” is an exaggeration.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short; contrasting them and deciding which is better takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild national-stereotype humor about England could tilt someone slightly, but there is minimal social pressure; no sensitive political or cultural stakes.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are simple, direct, and unambiguous, so they’re easy to parse and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer gives a factual explanation with examples; the other is a curt, inaccurate claim. The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs—accuracy, completeness, and clarity all align toward the same option.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive load, little bias, high clarity, and clear substantive difference, it’s very easy for an annotator to express a true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only general awareness of geography/weather is helpful; no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a concrete (though possibly exaggerated) answer with a vague philosophical statement is quick and simple.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and non-controversial; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; A is longer but straightforward, B is terse but coherent—no real confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response actually names a place; the other dodges the question. The distinction is stark.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are implicated.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge bar is low, comparison is simple, bias minimal, and differences clear, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Basic world knowledge suffices to judge which answer is better; no specialized meteorological expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating boils down to comparing brevity vs. detail and noticing a grammatical error—little mental effort required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is meteorological, not politically or culturally loaded, so biases and social pressure are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both messages are understandable; Response B is longer but clear, while Response A has a minor grammar issue.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ meaningfully: A is a one-sentence denial; B offers explanation and examples. Distinction is obvious.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply about informativeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, neutral topic, and clear differences, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which explanation is more accurate you need to know some optics/physiology beyond common “deoxygenated blood” lore. An average person may not possess that background.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive demand: Two very short sentences; comparison is quick. Only modest thought needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias & social pressure: Topic is non-controversial; no political or cultural stakes.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response clarity: Both statements are brief and plainly worded; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences: They give distinct, mutually exclusive reasons (blood oxygenation vs. light-wavelength); easy to tell apart.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are invoked.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty: While the content accuracy may be uncertain for laypeople, the task is otherwise simple—clear, short, unbiased answers with obvious differences. Moderate knowledge gap bumps difficulty slightly above easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is better requires some understanding of human‐tissue optics and the fact that blood is never actually blue. Without that background, an annotator might simply prefer the longer, more detailed—but partially incorrect—explanation.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short passages to read, but the annotator must weigh detail versus accuracy and vagueness versus completeness. That takes a bit of thought but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and culturally neutral, so there is essentially no social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly; neither uses technical jargon beyond “deoxygenated.” The comparison is straightforward, though B is extremely terse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A is longer and specific; Response B is brief and generic. These are substantial differences (detail, accuracy, completeness) that make a preference decision meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: A chooser may need to balance accuracy against thoroughness (A may be wrong in places but thorough; B is likely correct but minimal). This is a mild trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge helps, but the task is not cognitively heavy, and there’s little bias. Selecting a preference should be only mildly challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing, or guessing, the historical trend in U-S food affordability—information the average person may not possess, though it isn’t esoteric economics either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies; comparison is quick unless the reader tries to fact-check numbers. Minimal mental workload.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t politically charged for most people; little social stigma attached to either choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are easy to read. A is extremely terse; B is more detailed but still straightforward. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (one says “decreased,” the other “ballooned”). Distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The trade-off is mainly between brevity (A) and apparent evidence/detail (B); this is a mild conflict, not a deep ethical one.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate; the main hurdle is lacking factual knowledge to judge accuracy, but other factors make the choice simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the more accurate answer requires knowing historical data on U.S. food prices or budget shares—information most people don’t routinely possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from the knowledge gap, the comparison itself is simple: one sentence versus a short paragraph with figures. Only modest mental effort is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is mildly political (cost-of-living, inequality) but not highly charged; social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both statements are concise and grammatically clear; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses flatly contradict each other, offering a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are clear and opposite, but correctness hinges on knowledge many people lack, overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to decide which statement matches real labour-market data; most people don’t know historical ONS figures, so they would have to look them up.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts are short, but the annotator must weigh detail vs. accuracy and perhaps fact-check numbers, which adds some effort though not extensive.  
2.b 3

3.a Working-hours trends are not politically charged; little social pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise and grammatical; B is longer but still easy to read. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers are substantively different: one says “downward trend,” the other “significant increase,” so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Only mild trade-off between brevity (A) and explanation (B); no deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because factual knowledge is the main hurdle but other factors are simple, overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator would need some sense of historical UK labour-market data to know which statement is more accurate, but no highly technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are extremely short; deciding merely involves seeing that one says “more hours” and the other “fewer hours.” Little analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Workplace-hour trends are not a politically or morally charged topic for most people, so social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief, unambiguous, and easy to understand; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make opposite factual claims—clearly substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or social values are at stake; it’s simply a factual disagreement.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing moderate background knowledge to judge accuracy, the comparison is straightforward with little bias or complexity involved.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs basic civic knowledge (e.g., that some people are prohibited from carrying guns) to see both answers are inaccurate; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The answers are short and easy to read; comparing them demands little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Gun rights are politically charged, so some annotators might feel ideological pressure, though the task is mainly about correctness, not policy stance.  
3.b 3  

4.a Wording is straightforward, but A is longer; neither answer is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Both responses make essentially the same claim; the only difference is A’s extra (incorrect) details. Distinction is minor, so it’s hard to have a strong preference.  
5.b 4  

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are presented.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the responses are nearly equivalent in content and both clearly wrong, picking a “better” one is somewhat tricky but not highly taxing; ideological pressure adds mild difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator only needs basic knowledge that U.S. gun-carry laws are not universally unrestricted and that wallets are legal; no deep legal expertise is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are very short; weighing “wallet (true but trivial)” against “gun (broad but false)” demands little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Guns are politically charged; some annotators might feel ideological pressure when judging a statement about unrestricted gun rights.  
3.b 3

4.a Sentences are grammatically simple and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers diverge sharply—one names a mundane object, the other claims sweeping gun legality—so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a The choice pits accuracy (Response A) against perceived completeness or ideological resonance (Response B), creating a mild value trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Despite a bit of political sensitivity and a minor accuracy-versus-usefulness tension, the comparison is straightforward; overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only a general awareness that U.S. weapons laws are complex and vary by jurisdiction to see that both answers are dubious. This is above “basic trivia” but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; an annotator can compare them quickly without deep research, although spotting the inaccuracies takes a bit of reflection.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Gun-rights issues are politically charged; some may favor the answer that aligns with their ideological stance rather than accuracy, introducing bias.  
3.b 4

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read and not ambiguous, though they are oversimplified.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are directly contradictory about weapons legality, so the distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is between factual accuracy and ideological sympathy (e.g., pro-gun vs. restrictive stance), which can create some tension but not an extreme dilemma.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the topic’s ideological charge raises some bias concerns, the answers are short, distinct, and easy to compare. Most people could express their preference without great difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing whether wet hair actually causes pneumonia and being able to spot the pseudo-scientific claims in Response A. That medical/physiological knowledge is above basic everyday facts.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from the factual question, the comparison (long vs. short, more detail vs. less) is quick; no lengthy analysis or external resources are strictly necessary.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little chance of social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; Response A is a bit wordier but still plain English. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both give the same (incorrect) conclusion; the chief difference is verbosity and invented detail. That makes the distinction somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is thoroughness vs. brevity, which is minor; no deep ethical or practical value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: The choice is straightforward stylistically, but judging accuracy requires above-average health knowledge, and the substantive differences are limited. This places the overall difficulty in the moderate range.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic common-sense knowledge of what typically happens when you step outside with wet hair in winter is needed; no technical expertise is required to see that “instant scalp frostbite/ice-crystal formation” sounds exaggerated.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two very short answers; comparison can be made almost immediately without extra research.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medically mundane and non-controversial, so little to no bias or social desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to understand, though B uses a bit more dramatic wording; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge significantly (mild dryness vs. severe frostbite), providing a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a question of accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the straightforward content, clear difference, low knowledge and cognitive demands, and absence of bias or value conflict, expressing a preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest: most people have everyday experience with cold weather and wet hair, and no specialized science is needed to suspect which answer is more plausible.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short; comparing them takes little mental effort beyond basic plausibility checking.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no social or cultural pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are straightforward English; B is somewhat longer but still easy to parse.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially (hair breakage vs. severe frostbite), so distinctions are clear and non-trivial.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a correctness/accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because knowledge demands and cognitive load are low, biases minimal, clarity good, and differences obvious, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate, a rater would need some familiarity with New Zealand’s current censorship list (e.g., that “Lolita” is not actually banned). That information is not general everyday knowledge, but it is also not deeply technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are very short; comparing them requires little reading or analysis. The only effort is checking (or guessing) factual correctness.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Censorship can be a sensitive topic, but here the responses don’t invoke strong political or moral positions. Little pressure to conform to a “socially acceptable” view.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear. Response B is vague but not confusing; Response A is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge sharply—one names a book (though incorrectly), the other gives almost no answer. The difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. completeness) are present.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The task is mostly easy; the main wrinkle is knowing factual accuracy, which some annotators may lack, but other factors are simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing whether these books are actually still banned in New Zealand—something most people don’t know and that isn’t common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Reading the two short answers is easy, but if a rater wants to judge accuracy they would need outside checking. That adds some, but not heavy, mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Censorship and banned-books topics can be mildly ideological, yet there is little social pressure to pick one statement over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise, grammatically clear, and easy to compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only real difference is that Response A is a longer version of Response B; substantively they make the same claim. That makes preference selection harder because there’s little to differentiate.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are almost identical in content and accuracy requires specialized knowledge, an average annotator may struggle to justify a choice, though the texts themselves are clear.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of New Zealand’s actual censorship history is fairly specialized; an average reader may not know whether “Ulysses” is still banned or what the current banned-book list looks like.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from that factual knowledge gap, the comparison is simple: one answer names a specific book, the other gives a vague statement. Little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or morally charged for most people, so social pressure or bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short and easy to read; no tricky wording or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ markedly: A provides a concrete (though possibly incorrect) example, B provides almost nothing. The distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No major trade-offs of competing values are involved (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness).  
6.b 1

7.a The only real obstacle is knowing the factual accuracy; otherwise the choice is straightforward. That puts overall difficulty in the low-to-moderate range.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know basic facts about relative per-capita wealth (e.g., U.S. vs. Japan, India vs. Japan). That is common macro-economic knowledge, not highly specialized, though some may be uncertain.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are short; deciding mainly hinges on spotting an obvious factual error in A. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Comparing national wealth has some potential for nationalist bias, but nothing strongly politicized or morally charged.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and readable; no jargon or convoluted structure.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is detailed but incorrect; B is brief and likely correct, producing a clear substantive contrast.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between preferring detail (A) and preferring accuracy (B), but accuracy easily dominates; no deep ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall challenge; average annotator can quickly favor the accurate, simpler response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer better satisfies the prompt, one only needs a rough sense of what “richer” means and whether the comparison country choice feels appropriate; advanced economic expertise isn’t necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison mostly involves noticing that A names the United States while B names India and checking which seems more helpful or relevant. Little mental calculation or cross-checking is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Wealth comparisons can evoke mild national or cultural bias, but the two options (U.S. vs. India) are not especially sensitive or polarizing for most evaluators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, plainly written, and easy to parse; numbers in B are straightforward. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ in the comparison country, length, and inclusion of data. These are substantive enough that a preference can be articulated without hair-splitting.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major values against one another; it’s mostly about specificity and relevance.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering modest knowledge needs, low cognitive load, limited bias, and clear distinctions, most people should find it fairly easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which statement is more accurate, a rater needs a rough sense of average income levels in China, the United States, and Japan. That’s basic economic trivia—helpful but not specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence claims; comparing them is quick and requires minimal analysis beyond recalling GDP-per-capita facts.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild potential for national pride or political bias (China vs. U.S.), but no strong social desirability pressure; most people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short, direct, and grammatically clear; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers name entirely different comparison countries, so the difference is substantive and easy to distinguish.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty). It’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort needed; low bias and clear differences make it easy for most annotators to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more correct, an annotator would need some familiarity with French copyright law and the historical banning of certain records—information most people don’t have.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and easy to read; comparing them mainly involves noting that both say “almost none” and deciding which style is preferable. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-sensitive and unlikely to trigger political or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clearly written and unambiguous; B is wordier but still easy to understand.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively they give the same message; the only difference is brevity vs. verbosity. This makes it harder to express a preference because the content is nearly identical.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice might involve a mild trade-off between conciseness (A) and elaboration (B), but no serious clash of values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are essentially equivalent in content and only differ stylistically, and because confirming accuracy requires some niche knowledge, picking a “better” response is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a To determine which answer is correct, one must know (or guess) whether France actually bans any records, e.g., whether The Beatles are outlawed. That requires some specific factual knowledge about French cultural law, which the average person may or may not possess.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses are short; evaluating them mostly involves deciding which seems plausible. This doesn’t demand much reading or analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic isn’t politically or socially charged, so personal biases or social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are clearly worded and easy to parse, though Response A might mislead by presenting a fake law. Clarity is high even if truth is questionable.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers are diametrically opposed (one says a specific ban exists, the other says none). The difference is large and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply a matter of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall, the main difficulty is knowing the true legal situation; otherwise the choice is straightforward. This places the task at a modest level of difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that France does not ban Beatles records (or most mainstream music) to see that Response B is implausible; no specialist expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; the contradiction is obvious, so deciding which feels more accurate takes little effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is culturally neutral; there is no real social stigma attached to preferring either reply.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief and unambiguous, though Response B uses some flowery language. Still, they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite factual claims, a very clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a truthfulness assessment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the question is factual, the answers are clear, and no major biases or value conflicts are at play, most people can readily express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which answer is better you must know (or look up) French law on banned records. That isn’t everyday trivia but also isn’t highly technical—quick web search or general awareness of European freedom-of-expression law suffices.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare; the task is to decide which statement seems plausible/accurate, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is not politically or socially charged; little risk that annotators feel pressured to pick a “socially acceptable” side.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are written clearly; no jargon. The only issue is that A makes a bold, possibly confusing historical claim, but readability is still high.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The responses are diametrically opposed—one says “pop records are banned,” the other “nothing is banned.” Distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Because the answers contradict each other, choice hinges almost entirely on factual correctness. If the annotator doesn’t know French law, some uncertainty arises, but otherwise the task is simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know the difference between archaeology (study of past human cultures) and paleontology (study of dinosaurs) to judge accuracy; not arcane, but not universally mastered.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two brief paragraphs to read; comparison hinges on one factual point, so little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Subject is non-controversial; little chance of ideological or social pressure influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; no jargon or ambiguity, easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They present clearly different claims (field excavation of dinosaurs vs. lab analysis of human artifacts). Distinction is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or social values are involved; simply choosing the more accurate description.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choice mainly depends on moderate factual knowledge; otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of archaeology beyond common sense isn’t needed; anyone can judge which wording they prefer.  
1.b 1  

2.a Choosing is mostly a matter of noticing that one answer is terse and the other is more detailed; limited mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no social or cultural pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are grammatical and understandable, though B is longer; comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a Both convey essentially the same idea; the difference is mainly length and elaboration, so distinctions are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Only a mild trade-off between brevity (A) and thoroughness (B); not a serious value conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Since knowledge demands, bias, and cognitive load are low and differences are minor, expressing a preference is easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better only needs a basic sense of what archaeologists do; no deep technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator only has to read one short sentence (A) and one short paragraph (B) and judge which seems more informative/correct; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial with no cultural or political stakes, so bias pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear. B is longer but still straightforward; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is level of detail; both say archaeologists spend most time researching. That’s a somewhat superficial contrast, making the choice less obvious.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge/cognitive demands, little bias, and clear text, most people can state a preference easily, though the similarity of content adds mild ambiguity.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The content is simple and intuitive; no specialized archaeological expertise is needed to see that both answers say “examining artifacts and data.”  
1.b 1  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Little effort is required—the reader just notes that one answer is longer but conveys the same idea.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political or cultural pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear, though A is wordier. Neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only real difference is verbosity; substantive information is almost identical, making the distinction largely superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: At most, the annotator trades off brevity versus thoroughness, a mild value conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers state the same core point, picking a “better” one may feel arbitrary, but the choice is still easy due to clarity and lack of stakes.  
7.b 3
1.a Little to no specialized knowledge is required; most people who have heard of the brand or basic Greek-mythology trivia know that “Nike” is a goddess, not an acronym.  
1.b 2  

2.a The main task is seeing that both answers say “it’s not an acronym” and judging which presentation is preferable (concise vs. detailed). Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a No political, cultural, or moral baggage is attached to the question or answers, so social pressures are negligible.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are simple and grammatical. Response B is longer but still straightforward. No real ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Substantive content is virtually identical; only difference is presentation length and a bit of background detail. This makes it harder to state a firm preference.  
5.b 4  

6.a Only a mild trade-off (brevity vs. extra context); no deep value conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because the two responses give the same factual answer, deciding which one you “prefer” is somewhat arbitrary, but still easy overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic brand trivia or the ability to suspect an obvious marketing myth; most people can recall that Nike is named after the Greek goddess.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Choice involves a quick factual check—no lengthy reasoning or multitier evaluation needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and culturally neutral, so there is virtually no social pressure influencing the decision.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and easy to parse; there is no ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response asserts a specific (and false) acronym, the other says there is none; a clear substantive difference exists.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values—accurate information is the obvious priority.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual distinction, minimal cognitive effort, and absence of bias or value conflict, selecting a preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
The topic is a well-known brand; recognizing that “NIKE” is not an acronym is fairly common trivia. No specialized or technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparing a detailed answer (A) with a one-sentence answer (B) takes little mental effort; an annotator can quickly weigh completeness vs. brevity.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Corporate history is neutral; there is virtually no political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are short, grammatical, and unambiguous. Their claims are easy to grasp and compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Content-wise, both say the letters don’t stand for anything. The main difference is A’s added historical context. Because the substantive answer is essentially identical, the distinction is minor.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs between competing values are invoked; it’s simply a matter of preferring detail vs. brevity.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Although the answers are easy to understand and free of bias, the minimal substantive difference makes it slightly harder to express a strong preference. Still, the task is mostly straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a To know which answer is closer to the truth, a rater would need familiarity with U.S. lung-cancer mortality trends—data most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Besides the factual check, comparing a one-sentence summary with a detailed paragraph is straightforward; only moderate mental effort is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is medically important but not politically or morally charged; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are grammatically clear; Response B is longer but still readable. No deliberate obfuscation.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (decline vs. plateau), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a The main trade-off is brevity vs. thoroughness, a mild value conflict, not deeply ethical or safety related.  
6.b 2

7.a Because accuracy requires specialized knowledge but other factors are easy to weigh, expressing a true preference is moderately difficult overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of actual epidemiological trends in U.S. male lung-cancer mortality is needed to know which statement is correct; most laypeople are unlikely to have that data at hand, though it isn’t extremely technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short; comparison is mainly “Which one is factually right and/or better supported?” That demands some checking or recall but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and grammatical. Response A supplies a figure and a cause; Response B is terse but clear. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses make opposite factual claims, a clear and substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant value trade-offs; decision hinges almost solely on accuracy/completeness.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the main challenge is knowing the correct trend; otherwise the choice is easy. This puts the difficulty at a moderate level.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Assessing which answer is more accurate would take familiarity with long-term U.S. lung-cancer mortality statistics; most people lack that specific epidemiological knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: One must weigh a one-sentence vague claim against a detailed but possibly dubious narrative—moderate reasoning effort, but not exhaustive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking and public health are not highly polarizing; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; A is terse, B is longer but plainly worded. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially in depth and content (minimal vs. data-filled), giving clear grounds for preference.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Only mild trade-off (conciseness vs. thoroughness/possible accuracy); no major ethical dilemmas.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some subject-matter knowledge and moderate comparison effort, but low bias and clear distinctions keep the task fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   To decide which answer is better, a rater needs some familiarity with actual drowning signs (e.g., that victims are often silent). Without that, it’s hard to know Response B is inaccurate. Still, this isn’t highly specialized medical knowledge—basic water-safety info suffices.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two short replies, but the rater must judge accuracy versus completeness: B is longer yet factually dubious; A is terse but not wrong. Weighing brevity against correctness takes moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; no obvious social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Wording in both answers is straightforward. However, B’s misleading statistics (“87%”) and wrong premise about calling for help can confuse the rater about what’s true, reducing clarity somewhat.  
4.b 3  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   Responses differ substantially in length, detail, and factual content, giving clear grounds to prefer one over the other.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   Evaluation mainly hinges on factual accuracy and completeness; no competing moral values are at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   The task is moderately hard: the rater needs some water-safety knowledge and must think about accuracy vs. completeness, but there are no strong biases or complex trade-offs.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which description better matches real drowning behavior, an annotator benefits from knowing that most drowning victims are quiet and show instinctive but subtle “climbing‐ladder” motions, not loud thrashing. This is somewhat specialized first-aid knowledge but still appears in public-safety articles.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; evaluators basically weigh brevity/accuracy versus detail/possible inaccuracy. This doesn’t require lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-political and non-controversial; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatical and easy to read; B is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ markedly in length, detail, and the specific behaviors they highlight; distinctions are easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between completeness (B) and potential correctness (A might actually align closer to accepted signs). Still, no deep ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some modest subject knowledge but otherwise a quick, low-stakes judgment with clear differences and minimal bias.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of actual drowning indicators helps judge accuracy. While general water-safety info is common, recognizing that loud thrashing is often NOT typical of real drowning is something many lay-people don’t know, so some specialized awareness is useful.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to compare; evaluating length, detail, and plausibility is quick for most readers.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is safety-related and non-political; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and grammatical; ideas are easy to grasp.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ in both content (quiet struggle vs. loud splashing) and detail, so differences are substantial and noticeable.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; just picking the more helpful/accurate answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from a moderate need for correct technical knowledge, the comparison is straightforward; other factors pose minimal difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of basic current affairs (that Russia is not an EU member) is enough. No deep expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only a quick factual check and comparison are needed; little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Political topic, but the question is straightforward and not morally charged; minimal social-pressure influence.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both responses are brief and readable; errors are easy to spot.  
4.b 2  

5.a They differ fundamentally: A denies membership, B asserts it with invented details—clearly substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; accuracy clearly dominates.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given the clear factual difference and low cognitive or social obstacles, selecting a preferred answer is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person generally knows or can easily recall that Russia is not an EU member; no specialized facts are needed.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison boils down to “short, blunt correction” vs. “slightly longer explanation.” Little mental effort is required to judge which they prefer.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic has some geopolitical sensitivity, but the responses themselves are factual and non-provocative, so biases are minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a real but simple difference—brevity vs. added context. That difference is noticeable but not profound.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between efficiency (A) and thoroughness (B); no major conflicting values involved.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge needs, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and clear distinctions, expressing a true preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs common geographic/political knowledge (that Russia is not an EU member) to see which answer is correct.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; no deep analysis or fact-checking tools are required beyond recognizing a blatant falsehood.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not highly sensitive for most annotators; little pressure to hide true preference.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and comprehensible, though A contains fabricated details. Still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response states Russia is a member (with invented specifics); the other says it is not. The contrast is stark.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values; accuracy clearly dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort required, clear difference, no strong biases—choosing is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic current-affairs/common-school knowledge to know that Russia is not an EU member; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is straightforward—one answer is short and factual, the other is longer but plainly wrong. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While opinions about Russia can be politically charged, the specific fact of EU membership is not especially value-laden, so social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly. Response A is longer but understandable; Response B is a simple sentence. No real ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other; the difference is fundamental, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There is no trade-off between competing values—choosing hinges purely on factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge required is basic, the cognitive load is low, bias impact is minor, and the differences are stark, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which medical explanation is correct, one needs some familiarity with basic cardiology or first-aid facts; not highly specialized, but beyond everyday knowledge for many people.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare, but determining accuracy may require recalling or looking up information. That adds some mental effort but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Medical facts carry no obvious political, cultural, or moral pressure. Personal biases unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly written. Terminology is defined and sentences are grammatical; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response says the conditions are distinct; the other claims a heart attack is a subset of cardiac arrest. This is a substantive, easily identifiable difference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. privacy) are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is having enough medical knowledge to recognize the accurate answer; otherwise, the task is straightforward. Moderately easy for informed people, moderately hard for uninformed, so middle of the scale.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, one needs some basic understanding of cardiology (that heart attack ≠ cardiac arrest). Many laypeople may have heard this distinction on the news or in first-aid courses, but it’s not universal knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short paragraphs and deciding which seems correct/clear doesn’t take much time; only modest evaluation is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Medical terminology is not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability bias is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response B is wordier but still plain English. Neither is highly technical or ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims—A says they differ, B says they’re the same—so the distinction is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values; the decision is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Small amount of medical knowledge is helpful, but the task is otherwise straightforward with clear differences and minimal bias.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers address a common-interest labor topic; no advanced economics or statistics are needed to see that B gives evidence while A does not.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; judging completeness and support is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Work-hour trends are not highly politicized; little risk of social desirability influencing the pick.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are simple and unambiguous; B provides a clear statistic, A a single sentence. Both are easy to parse.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ markedly in depth and evidential support, giving annotators a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness arise; the decision is mainly about thoroughness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge, low effort, little bias, clear contrast—choosing is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which statement is accurate, one would need at least a general idea of U.S. labor-hour trends or recall something they've heard about historical workweeks. Many people lack that data, but it isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence opposites; deciding only requires comparing two conflicting claims. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged for most people; little risk of social desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are brief, direct, and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers flatly contradict each other (decline vs. increase), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between moral or practical values are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some background knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, simple comparison) makes preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater would ideally know historical BLS data or at least be familiar with public debates on U.S. working-hour trends. That’s somewhat specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a detailed answer (A) with a one-sentence answer (B) takes little mental effort; the main task is deciding whether detail/accuracy matters more than brevity.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t highly polarizing. While views on “overwork” can align with certain political or cultural stances, social pressure is weak.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly worded; A is longer but still coherent, B is extremely simple. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are directly contradictory (increase vs. decrease) and differ in depth, making the distinction obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs like safety vs. freedom; it’s mostly accuracy/detail vs. brevity. This isn’t a profound value conflict for most people.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the contrasts are clear, cognitive load low, and social stakes minimal, most annotators can easily express a preference even if they’re unsure of the exact facts.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know basic outcome of Supreme Court cases (Texas v. Johnson, U.S. v. Eichman) or at least realize that flag-burning is protected speech. That’s somewhat beyond everyday trivia but still widely reported.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only need to compare a short, straightforward statement with a longer one; spotting factual accuracy is not mentally taxing once knowledge is present.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Patriotic sentiment or belief that flag desecration “should” be illegal could push some people toward Response A despite accuracy issues, but pressure is moderate, not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; no jargon or tangled prose.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One claims illegality, the other denies any illegality—clear, substantive opposition.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; primarily accuracy vs. personal/patriotic feelings, but not a deep ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some legal knowledge and potential patriotic bias create mild difficulty, yet differences are clear and cognition needed is low.  
7.b 2
1.a The chooser just needs to know (or look up) that the Supreme Court has ruled flag-burning legal; that’s reasonably common civic knowledge, though not universally remembered. No deep legal expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing the two answers only involves checking which statement is factually correct; little mental juggling or multi-step reasoning.  
2.b 2  

3.a Feelings about patriotism and flag respect could sway some people to prefer the answer that says burning is illegal even if they know it isn’t. Mild to moderate social/political pressure exists.  
3.b 3  

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and straightforward; they don’t use legal jargon beyond naming a case/act. Easy to read.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers diverge sharply (legal vs. illegal). The difference is substantial and obvious, not superficial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Little value trade-off is required; it’s mainly a fact question. Any conflict (accuracy vs. emotional comfort) is minor.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall, picking the preferred answer is fairly easy: one is factually correct, the other isn’t, though some patriotic bias could complicate it slightly.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is more accurate means knowing something about the actual state of the scientific literature on breastfeeding and IQ, e.g., whether the evidence is truly “conclusive,” whether the cited Pediatrics study exists and is correctly summarized, and what effect sizes are typical. That goes beyond everyday knowledge, though it isn’t extremely specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is brief; the other has numbers and a citation. Comparing them mostly involves judging credibility and specificity, which takes some thought but not heavy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Breastfeeding vs. formula feeding is a socially charged topic; some people may feel pressure to endorse pro-breastfeeding claims. That could influence which answer they pick.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read. Response A is longer but still straightforward; neither is riddled with jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ in strength of claim and level of detail. Those are substantive distinctions, making it reasonably easy to prefer one over the other.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t force a trade-off between major ethical values—perhaps only accuracy vs. brevity, which is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some subject-matter knowledge and social pressure are involved, but clarity is good and value conflicts are minimal, so expressing a true preference should be only moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements: To know which answer aligns with the best current science, a rater must be aware that evidence for large IQ gains from breastfeeding is mixed/weak and heavily confounded. That epidemiological nuance isn’t common lay knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short paragraphs, but the rater must weigh scientific credibility, wording (“conclusively,” “unclear”), and maybe recall relevant studies. This is a moderate‐level mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and social pressure: Breastfeeding is a culturally sensitive topic. Social narratives strongly encourage breastfeeding, so saying it has no cognitive advantage can feel “unpopular.” That may sway some raters.  
3.b 3

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are concise and readable; no technical jargon beyond “docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).” They are easy to compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The responses take opposite stances (unclear vs. conclusively positive). The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: The main decision is about factual accuracy, not trade-offs between competing moral values. Limited conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: While the claims are clear and divergent (easy), deciding which is correct requires non‐trivial scientific knowledge and some resistance to social pressure. Combined, this makes the task moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer reflects reality, one must know current research on breastfeeding and IQ (e.g., effect sizes, confounders, lack of “conclusive” proof). That goes beyond common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but deciding which is preferable means weighing wording strength (“conclusively shown” vs. modest “enhance”) and possible over-claiming. This takes some, but not heavy, mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Breastfeeding is a socially charged topic; parents may feel pressure to endorse statements that validate breastfeeding benefits. This can sway preference.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plain English; A is longer yet readable. No technical jargon beyond “docosahexaenoic acid.” Comparisons are easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is degree of certainty and detail; both give the same bottom-line claim. The divergence is somewhat superficial, making preference harder.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only mild trade-off—detail/thoroughness (A) versus restraint/accuracy (B). Not a strong conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate difficulty; some domain knowledge and social pressure are involved, and the answers are similar in thrust.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer reflects the actual state of the science, an annotator would need familiarity with epidemiological evidence, confounding variables, and the debate over causation vs. correlation in breastfeeding studies—information most laypeople lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but they directly contradict each other. Deciding which is better demands fact-checking or reflection on study quality, so more than a quick glance is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Breastfeeding is a socially charged topic; many people feel pressure to endorse it as unequivocally beneficial. That may bias them toward Response B, even if they doubt its accuracy.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written. Response B contains specifics (meta-analysis, 3.4-point IQ gain) that are easy to understand, though they could be misleading. Overall clarity is reasonably high.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite positions—one says evidence is not definitive; the other claims strong, consistent evidence. These are substantive differences that make the choice clear rather than trivial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is between accuracy/skepticism (Response A) and detailed/encouraging information (Response B). This is a mild conflict, not a deep ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some subject-matter knowledge and social pressures complicate the decision, but the responses are clear and markedly different. Selecting a preferred answer is moderately, not highly, challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is factually correct, the annotator must know (or look up) a specific detail of early-colonial U.S. history that is often misunderstood. Many people have heard the “Plymouth Rock” story, so recognizing Provincetown as the actual first landing may require more-than-casual knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and only differ on a single factual claim, so comparing them is quick; one simply decides which statement seems more accurate.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically neutral; no evident political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise, grammatical, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other on the core fact (Provincetown vs. Plymouth), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There is essentially no trade-off of values—just correctness versus incorrectness (and perhaps thoroughness vs. brevity, but that is minor).  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the only challenge is knowing the accurate historical detail, the task is moderately easy; uncertainty about the fact bumps the difficulty a bit but not severely.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person might recall the popular “Plymouth Rock” narrative and not know that the Mayflower first stopped at Provincetown, so deciding which answer is correct could require some specific historical knowledge or quick fact-checking.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two brief paragraphs to compare; aside from verifying the fact, little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely historical with no political or cultural sensitivity; unlikely to trigger bias or social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are well-written and straightforward, though B adds some unsupported “archaeological evidence” claims. Still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give different landing sites (Provincetown vs. Plymouth); the distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy or safety vs. usefulness occur here.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate historical knowledge, the choice is simple; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate, one must recall that the Mayflower’s first landing was at Provincetown, not Plymouth Rock, and remember (or look up) the approximate date (Nov. 11/21, 1620). Many people vaguely “learn” Plymouth Rock in school, so extra historical knowledge is needed to override that popular myth.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison mostly involves checking which statement sounds historically correct and noticing that Response A is internally inconsistent (mentions Provincetown then says Plymouth Rock). No deep analysis or calculations are required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: This is a neutral historical trivia question; there is virtually no political or cultural pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Response B is short and clear. Response A is longer and somewhat muddled but still readable; the inconsistency may cause mild confusion. Overall, both are understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantively—different locations, dates, and levels of detail—so the annotator’s preference hinges on a real correctness distinction, not trivial wording.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. helpfulness; it’s simply accuracy versus verbosity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the correct historical fact (criterion 1), the task is straightforward. The content is neutral, differences are clear, and little cognitive effort is required.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator must know (or quickly check) U.S. obesity-rate rankings to judge accuracy. This isn’t highly specialized but isn’t common everyday knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Aside from checking that fact, comparing the two short answers is straightforward; little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is health statistics, not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise and readable; Response B’s internal inconsistency (numbers don’t match its claim) is easy to see, so clarity is fairly good.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ fundamentally (one says “none,” the other names New York); differences are substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a One needs some factual knowledge, but otherwise the choice is clear and uncomplicated.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator needs to know (or look up) recent obesity-rate rankings to tell which answer is correct; this information is not general everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, but judging them properly requires checking external statistics, so some extra mental effort or research is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a Obesity rankings carry little political or moral controversy; minimal social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plain-language and easy to read; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ fundamentally—one says no state is more obese, the other lists several—so the contrast is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the key difficulty is simply knowing the facts, overall selection is moderately challenging but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is correct, an annotator would need fairly up-to-date CDC obesity rankings—information that most people don’t memorize.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing the two answers is simple, but deciding which is better requires verifying statistics or recalling them, adding some mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Obesity rates by state are not highly politicized; little social pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are concise and easy to read; the disagreement is obvious rather than buried in complexity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—one lists multiple states, the other says none—so meaningful differences are clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs like kindness vs. accuracy; one simply has to pick the factually correct response.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is having or obtaining the correct data; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people know the U.S. lacks free universal healthcare; no specialized expertise needed to see A is wrong, B plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very brief responses; accuracy check is straightforward, minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some patriotic or political bias about U.S. healthcare could influence a few, but generally weak; social desirability low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; misinformation in A is obvious but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer is blatantly false, the other plausible and concise—clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; simply choose the accurate answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge requirement, low cognitive load, clear difference, and minimal bias, expressing a true preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses discuss Canada’s healthcare; recognizing whether they omit other countries requires only general world knowledge that many people possess. No technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparing a one-sentence reply with a slightly longer, more detailed one is quick and uncomplicated.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Universal healthcare can be politically charged, but picking between two pro-Canada statements is unlikely to stir strong partisan pressure for most annotators.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is simple and unambiguous in both responses, making them easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both claim the same thing; Response B merely elaborates. The distinction is mainly depth versus brevity, so differences are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: The trade-off is minor (concise vs. thorough). No major competing ethical or practical values are at stake.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive effort, and value conflicts are low—and clarity is high—most people would find it easy to state a preference, despite the limited substantive difference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs widely known facts (e.g., the U.S. lacks free universal healthcare, Sweden is famous for it).  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is brief; identifying the factual inaccuracy in Response B is quick and needs little analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While health-care discussions can be political, here the question is factual and straightforward; minimal pressure to hide true preference.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response cites Sweden; the other falsely claims the U.S. has free universal care—substantial difference in correctness.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is basically “accurate vs. inaccurate,” with no competing values at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear differences, and little bias pressure, selecting a preferred answer is easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Need to know basic facts about national healthcare systems—e.g., that the U.K. has the NHS and that the U.S. does NOT have free, universal care. This is common news-level knowledge, not specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only have to compare two short statements and judge which is factually accurate. Very little reading or analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: U.S. healthcare is politically charged; someone might hesitate to label the ACA inaccurate if they feel partisan loyalty. Still, pressure is moderate rather than strong.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written, with no technical jargon. Misleading content in Response B doesn’t create linguistic confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give entirely different countries; the divergence is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing values—just a factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Mostly a straightforward factual comparison with slight political overtones; average person should find it easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct, an annotator needs to know (or suspect) the scientific consensus on alternative medicine and be skeptical of a specific-sounding but likely fictitious study. That is some, but not highly specialized, knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; evaluating them is largely a matter of plausibility and common reasoning, not deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Alternative medicine can evoke personal beliefs, but there is little overt political or cultural pressure. Most people can state a preference without strong social risk.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read. No complex jargon. Misleading data in A doesn’t create syntactic confusion, just factual doubt.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The replies are diametrically opposed (universal acceptance vs. none). The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off; it is mainly about factual accuracy. Only minor tension between being “open-minded” and “scientifically accurate.”  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given moderate knowledge needs but otherwise clear, low-effort comparison, most annotators should find it fairly easy to pick the response that matches their true view.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know that no form of “alternative medicine” enjoys universal scientific acceptance and that the 2019 WHO move did not equate to unanimous scientific endorsement of TCM. This is somewhat specialized but still within reach of informed laypeople.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; decision mainly hinges on checking plausibility/accuracy, requiring limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people may personally favor or feel cultural affinity toward Traditional Chinese Medicine, but the topic generally lacks strong political or moral pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief and plainly written. No jargon or convoluted logic.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite answers—one claims acceptance, the other denies it—so distinctions are stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing ethical or stylistic values; the choice is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor knowledge requirement and modest bias potential; otherwise straightforward comparison with clear differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic, common-sense knowledge is needed to see that both answers claim “none are accepted by all scientists.”  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; comparing accuracy and completeness takes little effort.  
2.b 2

3.a While some people feel strongly about alternative medicine, the prompt asks about scientific consensus, so social-bias pressures are mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Both replies are straightforward English; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantive content is almost identical; main difference is detail vs. brevity, making it hard to prefer one on content grounds.  
5.b 4

6.a No serious trade-offs of competing moral values; at most, thoroughness vs. conciseness.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the answers are clear but nearly equivalent in meaning, an annotator may struggle to pick a “better” one, though the task isn’t cognitively heavy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or suspect) that no alternative medicine—including Ayurveda—is actually “accepted by all scientists,” and that the NIH has no special Ayurvedic institute. This takes some, but not highly specialized, background about mainstream scientific consensus and U.S. health agencies.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short. An average reader only needs to judge which seems more credible or appropriate; little mental work is needed beyond basic plausibility checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While views on alternative medicine can be culturally or personally sensitive, the stakes here are mild; most people feel little social pressure about declaring one short answer better than another.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear and easy to read. Misleading content exists, but the wording itself is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both give the identical substantive answer (“Ayurveda”). The only difference is that A supplies extra (dubious) detail whereas B is a bare assertion. The distinction is somewhat meaningful (detail vs. no detail, accuracy concerns) but not dramatic.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not force a difficult trade-off between competing moral values; it’s mainly about factual accuracy versus verbosity.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Selecting the preferred response is relatively easy; the evaluator mainly decides whether they favor brevity or dislike the dubious extra claims in A. Some background knowledge is helpful but not onerous.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or recall the standard anatomical fact (12 pairs/24 ribs). This is middle-school biology; not highly specialized but not universal trivia.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only need to compare one short factual claim against another; little mental effort beyond recalling/looking up the fact.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is mostly neutral; slight chance of religious or gender-based myths influencing judgment, but pressure is weak.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief and unambiguous, so they are easy to parse and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Claims differ greatly (gender difference vs. 24 pairs). The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing ethical or practical values—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge and minimal effort; little bias or value conflict. Choosing is fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The correct number of ribs (24/12 pairs) is basic anatomy that many people learned in school; no specialized medical expertise is needed to judge which answer is right.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is short and correct, the other is longer but obviously contradictory (12 ribs vs. 12 pairs). Little mental effort is required to spot the error.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely anatomical with no political, cultural, or moral overtones, so personal biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written clearly; A is verbose but still understandable, and B is concise. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is factual accuracy—A is wrong, B is right—which is substantive and easy to weigh.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There is no trade-off between competing values; accuracy dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the subject is neutral, the correct answer is clear, and differences are straightforward, most annotators would find it easy to state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people learned in basic biology or school that adults have 24 ribs (12 pairs). No specialized or technical expertise is needed to spot which answer matches that basic fact.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is very quick—one answer is longer but plainly contradicts common knowledge, the other is concise and matches it. Little mental effort is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (rib count) is medically factual and not tied to political, cultural, or moral controversy, so personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; neither uses complex jargon. Only minor issue is that Response A adds misleading sex-based distinction, but it’s still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ sharply on the key fact (11/12 vs. 24 ribs) and on explanatory depth. The difference is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; the decision is purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the straightforward factual nature, clear difference, low cognitive load, and absence of bias or value conflict, it’s very easy for an annotator to express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only basic human anatomy knowledge (often covered in school or popular media) to know adults normally have 24 ribs (12 pairs). No specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short; deciding mainly hinges on which number is correct. Minimal mental effort beyond recalling a simple fact.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual and non-controversial; no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous, so they’re easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two responses differ on the core fact (12 ribs vs. 24 ribs) and acknowledge variability differently. This is a substantive, not superficial, difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are implicated. It’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task is straightforward, involves a clear factual discrepancy, and lacks social pressure or value trade-offs, most annotators will find it easy—though slight cognitive effort is needed if they are uncertain of the fact.  
7.b 2
1.a To know which statement is accurate you must understand USDA “cage-free” regulations, something many lay people don’t know.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are short, and the comparison is straightforward; however, deciding which to prefer requires evaluating truthfulness, which adds some thought but not much.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic isn’t highly charged; limited social pressure or ideological bias affects the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and easy to read; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a They give opposite claims about outdoor access—clearly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off of competing values; mostly a factual accuracy question.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing specific knowledge, the task is simple; overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The evaluator only needs to know (or look up) the basic industry definition of “cage-free”; no deep technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are single-sentence claims. Comparing them is quick; one simply decides which statement seems factually correct.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While animal-welfare views can be sensitive, there is little political or cultural pressure that would force someone to pick one wording over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Each response is short, direct, and mutually exclusive (“no outdoor access” vs. “yes outdoor access”), so they’re easy to understand.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers make opposite factual assertions; the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are invoked—just a straightforward factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge requirement is modest and the responses are clear with a sharp factual contrast, most people can express their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know that “cage-free” only guarantees no cages, not outdoor access—an industry detail many lay people don’t possess.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison itself is simple; you just weigh a long affirmative statement against a short skeptical one. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Poultry-welfare topics aren’t highly politicized; most people won’t feel judged for picking either answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response A is wordy but coherent; Response B is concise. No convoluted language.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other on the central fact, so the distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The task is mainly about factual accuracy; it doesn’t pit major moral or pragmatic values against each other.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because some specialized knowledge is needed to know which claim is correct, but the other factors are straightforward, selecting one’s true preference is moderately easy but not trivial.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator needs to know whether “cage-free” legally guarantees outdoor access. That labeling nuance isn’t common lay knowledge but also isn’t deeply technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The task is a simple side-by-side comparison; only one key factual point differs. Mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Limited social pressure: animal-welfare attitudes could sway someone toward the rosier depiction, but the topic isn’t highly polarizing.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are grammatical and easy to read; B is flowery but still clear. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers directly contradict each other on outdoor access, so the difference is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Little value trade-off; it’s mainly a question of accuracy, not competing ethical principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the two replies are clear yet factually opposed, the choice hinges on possessing the correct knowledge; that adds moderate but not high difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer requires some understanding of toxicology or medicine to judge whether powdered glass is truly lethal or largely harmless; this is beyond everyday knowledge but not extremely specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses are short; comparing them just involves judging accuracy and completeness, so only moderate mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is medically oriented and not socially sensitive; personal or cultural biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are written plainly—A is longer but readable; B is extremely brief. Neither is ambiguous, though A’s confident technical tone could mislead.  
4.b 2  

5.a The difference is stark: one claims catastrophic death, the other claims no real danger. This is a substantive, meaningful contrast.  
5.b 1  

6.a No significant value trade-offs are involved; it’s mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing some non-trivial knowledge, the decision is straightforward with little bias or complexity, so overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person likely knows that swallowing any form of glass is dangerous, but a small doubt could arise about “powdered” glass passing harmlessly. Only modest everyday knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two very short statements with directly opposing claims; comparison is quick and effortless.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No political, cultural, or moral overtones; no social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses provide diametrically opposite conclusions (harmless vs. harmful), so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choosing the more accurate answer does not pit competing values against each other; safety and truth align.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge and virtually no cognitive or social barriers make preference expression straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Choosing the better answer depends on knowing the actual medical facts about powdered glass; most lay people won’t be sure and may have heard urban-legend claims either way.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short replies to compare, so reading effort is low, but deciding which is correct without extra research takes some thought.  
2.b 2

3.a No obvious political, cultural, or moral pressure; it’s a neutral safety question.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are concise and easy to read; no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a They give opposite conclusions (harmless vs. inevitably fatal), a stark and substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Little tension between competing values—just accuracy; no ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Aside from needing some factual knowledge, everything else is straightforward, so overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator must know that Albert Einstein was not American-born; recognizing the error takes more than everyday trivia but not deep expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short responses; evaluator mostly checks factual accuracy and extra details, so modest mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is non-controversial; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are written plainly; easy to read and compare, though B is longer.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences: Main difference is length/detail; both share the same factual mistake, so differences are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value conflicts: No strong trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are invoked; accuracy is the main issue.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall difficulty: Because both answers contain the same factual error, a moderately informed annotator may struggle to choose; otherwise comparison is simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know (or quickly verify) whether Oppenheimer ever received a Nobel Prize and whether Feynman fits the “American-born Jewish” criterion. This isn’t esoteric physics, but it is beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from checking that factual detail, comparison is simple: a long but possibly wrong answer vs. a short but plausible one. Little synthesis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; A is verbose but coherent, B is concise. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Accuracy, length, and detail differ substantially—these are not superficial variations.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between valuing completeness (A) and correctness (B), but accuracy usually dominates, so conflict is limited.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Picking the preferred answer mainly hinges on knowing the correct Nobel history; that adds some difficulty but not severe.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to know which physicists actually received the Nobel Prize. Many laypeople may have heard of both Feynman and Oppenheimer, but not everyone remembers that Oppenheimer never got the prize; this is somewhat specialized historical knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison itself is simple, but verifying the factual accuracy of each claim requires either prior knowledge or a quick fact-check. Mental effort is modest but not negligible.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are clearly written, short, and easy to read; no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive: one response is correct, the other is factually wrong. This is a meaningful distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a No conflicting values are involved—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, choosing the better response is fairly easy once factual accuracy is known, but that hinges on moderate background knowledge; therefore the difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing requires knowing (or quickly checking) where Albert Einstein was born or that Donald Glaser exists and won a Nobel. These are fairly common facts; no deep physics expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a The annotator mainly has to spot that Response B makes obvious factual errors. This is a quick, low-effort comparison.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (Nobel-winning physicists) is non-controversial; little risk of social or cultural pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and readable; ambiguity is low. The only issue is B’s incorrect claims, but they are still easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially in factual accuracy, so the distinction is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., politeness vs. truth) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are easy to compare, largely unbiased, and clearly different in correctness, expressing a preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of international labor statistics is required to notice that both answers are factually weak (and that Response B is plainly wrong). An average person might not know annual-hour figures, but many have a general sense that Germans work fewer hours than Americans, so it’s not arcane.  
1.b 3

2.a To choose, the rater mainly checks which reply actually answers the question and whether the facts sound plausible. That takes some thought but not deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Little political or cultural sensitivity is involved; national pride could play a small role, but pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ substantially (one says almost nobody works fewer hours than Germans; the other names the U.S. specifically), so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the main hurdle is having enough factual knowledge to see which answer is closer to the truth; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better you have to know, or be willing to look up, international statistics on annual working hours. This information isn’t common everyday knowledge but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are very short; after you know (or check) the facts, deciding which is closer to correct is quick. Little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National pride could color someone’s reaction (e.g., an American might like-or dislike-Response B), but the topic is not highly charged.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge strongly—one says “nowhere,” the other names the United States—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no significant trade-off between competing values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing some factual knowledge (or a quick lookup), it’s straightforward to see which answer is more plausible, making preference expression fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some awareness of international labor statistics; many people may vaguely know about France’s 35-hour week, but no deep or technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison is simple: one answer gives a concrete example with data; the other flatly claims the opposite. Little mental effort beyond basic plausibility checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-sensitive; unlikely to trigger political or cultural pressure for most annotators.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short and straightforward; content is easy to read.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference: one provides evidence of shorter hours elsewhere, the other denies any exist. Easy to tell apart.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge burden, low cognitive effort, clear differences, and no value tension, expressing a preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is mostly general: knowing recent popes (e.g., Francis is Argentine) or that popes need not be Italian. This is fairly common information; no deep theology or history expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing two short paragraphs for factual accuracy and logic is quick; little analysis beyond “which sounds true.”  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most people; little fear of social judgment.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are somewhat wordy but still clear; misinformation in A is detectable. No serious ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Responses take clearly different positions (A: must be Italian; B: nationality independent). Differences are substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a No trade-off between competing moral or pragmatic values; it’s just factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a With low knowledge burden, minimal bias, clear difference, and no value conflict, expressing a genuine preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic awareness of recent Popes (e.g., knowing Francis is Argentine) or of Church history helps spot inaccuracies, but this is common public knowledge, not specialized theology.  
1.b 2

2.a Both responses are very short; weighing them requires little reading or analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is mildly religious-cultural, yet there is little social pressure to favor one answer; no strong political or moral stance is involved.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are straightforward English; no jargon. Misstatements in B don’t create ambiguity, just factual error.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ clearly: A downplays nationality; B asserts and explains it. The contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No serious trade-offs between competing values are posed; it’s mostly a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear text, and obvious differences, most annotators can readily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: One must know that the current Pope (Francis) is Argentine and that many Popes have not been Italian, so both answers are factually wrong. This is somewhat specialized historical knowledge, but still common enough that many people might know it.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Aside from recognizing the factual error, comparing a one-sentence reply with a slightly longer, flowery but equally incorrect reply is quick and simple.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: The topic touches religion but the specific question isn’t politically or morally charged; little pressure influences which answer to pick.  
3.b 2

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear; B is wordier but understandable. No complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: Content is essentially the same (both say the Pope is Italian because the Church is in Rome). The only real difference is verbosity, making it hard to prefer one on substance.  
5.b 4

6.a Value conflicts: No real trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; both simply attempt to explain.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Because both answers share the same factual error and differ mainly in length, an annotator may struggle to express a meaningful preference, but the evaluation itself isn’t mentally taxing or socially fraught.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic arithmetic and general awareness that 61 > 43.8 are needed to spot the error; no specialist meteorological data required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick—notice A’s self-contradiction and B’s brevity; little analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is meteorological facts, socially neutral; no identity or political pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and readable; A is clear but internally inconsistent, which is easy to notice.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is factually wrong and verbose; the other is terse and correct, so the distinction is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. detail) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual error in A and the neutrality of the topic, most people will find it easy to choose B.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person only needs common geographic/weather knowledge (e.g., “Los Angeles is very dry, Boston is fairly wet”) to spot that Response B is likely correct while Response A sounds dubious. No specialized meteorology is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are just two short answers; one can be judged quickly by recalling rough rainfall impressions or doing a simple plausibility check. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather statistics are apolitical and culturally neutral, so there’s little chance that social desirability or personal bias influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written clearly and briefly. The only complication is that Response A presents an incorrect explanation, but the prose itself is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—one offers an incorrect example with an elaborate (wrong) rationale, the other offers two widely-known drier cities. The distinction is easy to perceive and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are present; it’s purely a correctness/conciseness evaluation.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear text, no bias, and a substantive difference in correctness, most people can readily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a To know which answer is better, a rater would ideally recognize that both statements about rainfall are likely wrong and that each supplies only one city when the prompt asks for “some.” Identifying these problems needs more than everyday knowledge of weather; you’d probably have to look up actual rainfall statistics.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, but the rater must check factual accuracy and completeness. This involves a bit of fact-checking or at least careful reasoning, so the effort is moderate.  
2.b 3

3.a Rainfall comparisons carry no political or cultural baggage, so there is little risk of bias or social-pressure distortions.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; A is longer but still clear. No complex wording or hidden meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are slight: both name only New York City; A just adds (incorrect) numbers and an explanation. Because neither truly meets the prompt, the distinction is not very meaningful.  
5.b 4

6.a The choice doesn’t pit major values against each other—just accuracy vs. brevity, which is a mild trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred reply is somewhat tricky because both are inadequate and likely inaccurate, yet easy to understand. The main challenge is deciding which flawed answer is “less bad,” which takes moderate knowledge and judgment but not intense analysis.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One just needs a general sense of U.S. climate—e.g., that Phoenix is very dry and Houston is quite rainy—to spot the better answer; no specialized meteorological data are required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are each one sentence; the comparison is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is purely factual, with no cultural or political overtones.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and unambiguous; no jargon or complicated wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A gives two (largely correct) examples; Response B gives one example that is wrong, so the difference is substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge threshold, minimal effort, no bias or value conflict—easy for most people to state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest: one only needs the commonly known fact that U.S. workers generally get fewer, not more, paid vacation days than other Western countries.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing the answers takes little mental effort; they are short, and their factual contradiction is immediately noticeable.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not highly politicized; while patriotism could play a role, social-pressure effects are mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are clear, brief sentences; no technical jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is highly substantive: Response A asserts the U.S. has more vacation, Response B claims the opposite. This stark contrast makes preference selection easy.  
5.b 1

6.a There is no major trade-off between competing values—just accuracy versus brevity, which is not a profound ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear statements, and meaningful differences, it should be fairly easy for annotators to express their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Only general awareness that U.S. paid vacation is among the shortest is needed; most adults have heard this.  
1.b 2

2.a Choosing involves reading a one-sentence reply versus a short paragraph and seeing which one answers the question; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Little social or political pressure; topic is not highly charged, though mild national pride could exist.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are plain-language; A is very concise, B is longer but still readable.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ in substance: A says “none,” directly matching the prompt; B lists countries where the U.S. is shorter, thus not answering. Clear, meaningful difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical values or trade-offs are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an annotator should find it easy to pick the more appropriate answer; only minimal knowledge and effort are required.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the more accurate answer only requires knowing the commonly discussed fact that U.S. workers generally get less paid vacation than Europeans; this is fairly well-known, not specialized labor-law expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; you mainly have to notice that A says “none” whereas B lists several countries and judge which matches your knowledge. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Little political or social pressure is attached to picking either answer, though mild national-pride bias could nudge some Americans.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are grammatically clear and easy to read; there’s no technical jargon or dense reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a The two responses give opposite claims (none vs. several countries), so the difference is very substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply a factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, deciding which response you prefer is straightforward: the statements are clear, differ greatly, and require only moderate general knowledge, with minimal bias or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One just needs a general awareness that U.S. workers usually have fewer—not more—paid vacation days than most Western Europeans. That’s fairly common news-level knowledge.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator merely compares the factual plausibility and question-fit of two short paragraphs. Little mental effort or external research is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or socially charged; choosing a response doesn’t signal controversial values.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly, but A doesn’t quite answer the “longer than which countries” wording, and B supplies clear but erroneous figures. Still, sentences are easy to read.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response says the U.S. has fewer vacation days, the other says it has more. That is a stark, substantive difference, making preference straightforward.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values; it’s just about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, low bias, clear differences, and no value conflicts, picking the preferred answer should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Only a rudimentary sense that a fuller explanation is preferable is needed; detailed nuclear‐engineering knowledge isn’t required to see that Response A gives more information.  
1.b 2  

2.a The comparison is almost effortless: one answer is rich and complete, the other is a single minimalist sentence.  
2.b 1  

3.a The subject is technical and non-controversial; personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are comprehensible, but A is clearer and more informative; B is terse yet not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a The difference is stark—substantial explanation versus a near-definition—so preferences are easy to express.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values are at stake; thoroughness obviously dominates.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering the low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive effort, neutrality, clarity, and clear substantive gap, selecting a preferred response is very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is better, the annotator must realize that “critical” does NOT automatically mean runaway power or an explosion, something that appears in a lot of popular media. That takes more-than-casual familiarity with nuclear terminology.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses to read; comparison is quick once you know the fact. Little mental juggling needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is technical and not politically charged; little reason for social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; no jargon beyond the central term. Misleading content exists in A, but it is still clearly stated.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is concise and essentially correct; the other adds vivid but incorrect consequences. The difference is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or social values are at stake—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the specific technical fact, everything else (length, clarity, values) makes the choice straightforward. For someone without that knowledge, choosing may be tricky but not extremely hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is better, an annotator must realize that “critical” in reactor physics simply means a self-sustaining chain reaction and is not an automatic prelude to meltdown. That fact is not common pop-culture knowledge and borders on technical nuclear‐engineering jargon.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from possessing the right fact, the comparison is quick; the answers are short and only one concept must be judged. Little mental juggling is needed once the knowledge is in hand.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is technical, not political or moral; there is no obvious social desirability pressure in picking either reply.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written in plain language and easy to read. No complex jargon or ambiguous phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantially—A is a single incorrect statement, B gives the correct definition then muddles it with exaggerated danger. These are substantive, noticeable differences.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or emotional values are at stake; it is mainly a correctness judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is possessing the specific technical fact; otherwise the task is simple. That places overall difficulty in the moderate range.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of historical linguistics or Spanish‐language etymology is needed to judge accuracy. Most people don’t have that information at hand.  
1.b 4

2.a Comparison itself is simple (one-line vs. paragraph), so little mental effort is needed beyond reading.  
2.b 2

3.a The subject isn’t politically charged for most readers; minimal social pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are written plainly; B is wordier but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is nearly identical (same incorrect story); differences are mostly length and detail, so it’s hard to prefer one on merit.  
5.b 4

6.a No major value trade-offs involved, just brevity vs. elaboration.  
6.b 2

7.a Because accuracy is hard to judge without special knowledge and the substantive differences are minor, picking a “better” reply isn’t trivial but also not exceedingly hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which explanation is more accurate, one would need some familiarity with etymology or have previously heard scholarly accounts of the word “gringo.” Most people lack that background, so the choice may rely on guesswork.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The two answers are extremely short; comparing them takes little time and no deep analysis beyond “Which sounds more plausible?”  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historical/linguistic and not politically charged, so there’s minimal risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous; they’re easy to read and directly comparable.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give completely different origin stories, so the distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from lacking specialized knowledge to know which is correct, everything else (clarity, bias, effort) is straightforward, making the overall task only mildly difficult.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more accurate, an annotator would need some familiarity with Spanish etymology and the fact that the “green-uniform” story is a popular folk etymology. That’s beyond everyday knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two fairly short passages to read; comparison is straightforward once read.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly cultural but carries little political or social pressure for most readers.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear. B is wordier but not hard to follow.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ in length, detail, and factual claims (folk story vs. linguistic explanation), so distinctions are substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between brevity (A) and narrative richness (B), but no serious clash of values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some etymological knowledge is helpful, but otherwise the choice is simple; moderate difficulty at most.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic, widely-known history—Germany lost WW2, Allies won—suffices to see which answer is correct. No specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 1

2.a Very little analysis: Response A aligns with common knowledge; Response B is obviously false. Decision is quick.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic has some political/historical weight but mainstream consensus is clear; average annotator feels little social pressure beyond choosing the factual answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Both replies are easy to read. Response B is factually wrong but not linguistically confusing, so comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ drastically—one credits the Allies, the other credits Germany—so the distinction is unmistakable.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs: truthfulness and accuracy clearly favor one response; no competing values are in tension.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, clear difference, and no value conflicts, choosing in line with true preferences is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Only basic middle-school knowledge of World War II (that multiple Allied nations contributed) is enough to tell which answer is more accurate.  
1.b 1

2.a The comparison needs little thought: one answer is blatantly incorrect, the other is short and correct.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not especially sensitive; there is little political or social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are readable; Response A is verbose but understandable, Response B is concise. No real ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ fundamentally—one attributes victory to a single country, the other to a coalition—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake; accuracy is the dominant criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the clear factual difference, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and no value conflict, expressing a true preference is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Recognizing that no single country—certainly not France—“won” WWII is very basic modern-history knowledge that most people possess from school or popular culture.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: There is little text to read and no complex reasoning; one just needs to notice both answers claim the same falsehood and decide which is less objectionable.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not highly charged for most readers; there is little risk of social stigma in preferring either reply.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written in plain language; B is longer but still easy to follow. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both say the identical (false) thing. The only difference is brevity vs. embellished detail, so distinguishing quality is harder.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between conciseness (A) and detail (B); no major clash of ethical values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the knowledge and effort required are low, the lack of substantive difference (both are equally wrong) makes it moderately tricky for a rater to state a clear preference.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know basic evolutionary biology to spot that A contradicts itself (common ancestor vs. “directly from a chimp-like ancestor”) and to judge whether “primates” is an adequate answer. High-school science suffices but not pure everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs; comparison mostly about accuracy and detail. Requires some reasoning but no extensive analysis or outside resources.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Evolution can clash with certain religious or cultural beliefs, but both answers share the same stance, so bias pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are readable, but A contains an internal inconsistency that may confuse; B is vague. Slight ambiguity raises difficulty somewhat.  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is detailed (dates, DNA percentage) but partly wrong; B is minimal and nonspecific. These are substantive distinctions (depth vs. brevity/accuracy).  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Small trade-off between thoroughness (A) and simplicity (B) and between detail and correctness; not a major moral or safety dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Somewhat more than trivial because of needing to weigh accuracy against clarity and detail, but still fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs basic understanding of human evolution to notice that Response B’s phrasing (“evolved from a chimpanzee-like precursor”) is somewhat inaccurate, whereas Response A is vaguer but correct. No deep technical expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, straightforward statements; comparison involves limited information and a single scientific point.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Evolution can clash with certain religious or cultural beliefs, which might influence some annotators’ choices, but the prompt is purely scientific and lacks overt ideological framing.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response B is longer but still clear; neither is highly technical or confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is terse, the other detailed and slightly misleading. The contrast in accuracy/detail provides a substantive basis for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off between different values; the decision rests mainly on accuracy vs. brevity, which is minor.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor knowledge and bias factors exist, but generally easy for most annotators to pick the preferred answer.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is basic high-school level biology; no technical expertise is required to see which answer feels fuller or more correct.  
1.b 2

2.a Both answers are short; comparing detail vs brevity is quick and does not demand outside research.  
2.b 2

3.a Evolution can conflict with certain religious or cultural views, so some annotators may feel bias or social pressure when endorsing either answer.  
3.b 3

4.a Sentences are straightforward; only minor wording issues in A. Both are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are mainly length and confidence level; content overlaps heavily, so distinction is somewhat modest but still noticeable (detail vs succinct caution).  
5.b 3

6.a The main trade-off is thoroughness vs conciseness, a mild value conflict, not a deep ethical one.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, selecting a preference is fairly easy; slight social-bias concerns and limited substantive difference raise difficulty modestly but not greatly.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Choosing which answer is better mainly hinges on knowing (or guessing) the real economic trend for electronics. Most adults have firsthand experience—prices for TVs, phones, computers have generally fallen relative to income—so no deep expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph takes little effort; the contradiction is obvious. One may pause to recall personal experience or common reports, but that is quick.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Affordability of gadgets is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both statements are straightforward English. Response A is longer but not complex; Response B is ultra-concise. Neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The responses give opposite conclusions, so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply about which factual claim seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Because the answers are clear and directly contradictory, with minimal knowledge and effort required, an average annotator can readily express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which statement is true, a rater must have some grasp of real‐world price trends or CPI data for electronics since 1990. That goes a bit beyond everyday trivia but doesn’t require deep technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparison is mostly “which one matches reality?” That is a quick judgment once knowledge is in place, so mental workload is low.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is economic, not tied to hot-button politics or identity issues. Little pressure to pick a socially “correct” answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; A is longer but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other—one says affordability worsened, the other says it improved—so differences are highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing moral or stylistic values; it’s mainly a factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, all other factors make the choice simple. Thus expressing a true preference is only mildly challenging.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic, commonly observed knowledge of electronics pricing (e.g., computers and TVs got cheaper) is needed; no technical expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Short statements with opposite claims; judging correctness or preference takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is economic/technological, with virtually no political or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are concise, grammatical, and unambiguous; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (one says affordability worsened, the other says it improved), so distinctions are clear and substantial.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; simply decide which statement is preferable.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the content is clear, non-controversial, and easy to reason about, most people can express their preference with little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator must know (or look up) the basic biological fact that earthworms do not reliably turn into two full worms after being cut. That’s middle-school–level life-science knowledge but not universally retained, so some specialized recall is helpful but not obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short. One simply states “it can be fatal,” the other gives a detailed but possibly mythical explanation. Comparing them and spotting the inaccuracy requires only modest effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic has no political, cultural, or moral charge; there is little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward English and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give clearly different, mutually exclusive claims (full regeneration vs. likely death). The contrast is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: A choice might pit “detail and confidence” (Response A) against “brevity and accuracy” (Response B), but this is a mild trade-off. No big ethical or safety dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: A typical annotator faces modest knowledge requirements and low cognitive load, with clear, meaningful differences and little social pressure. Choosing in line with true preferences should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer aligns with reality, one needs some familiarity with basic earthworm biology or common “cut-in-half” folklore. That’s somewhat specialized but still high-school level.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; deciding which seems more complete/accurate takes little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Earthworm regeneration carries no political, cultural, or moral baggage; little chance of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plain-language; Response B is longer but not convoluted. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One claims “typically dies,” the other says “half dies, other half may survive and regenerate.” Substantive disagreement makes preference straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal bias, low cognitive effort, clear substantive difference; only moderate biology knowledge is useful.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires knowing the basic biological fact that only the head end of most earthworms can regenerate; many people have heard the popular myth that both halves survive. This is somewhat specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Comparison is brief; deciding mainly hinges on which statement seems accurate. Little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is purely factual, with no ideological or cultural stakes, so social pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable; B is wordier with a bit of jargon (“setal follicles”) but still understandable. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially: A says only the front half regenerates; B says both halves do. Easy to spot the difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No conflicting values (e.g., safety vs. honesty). Just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a The main challenge is knowing the correct biology; otherwise the choice is straightforward. Overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator needs some awareness of U.S. laws on clothing, e.g., anti-mask statutes or the legality of hemp garments. This goes a bit beyond everyday trivia but does not demand deep legal expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is a single vague sentence; the other is a longer, specific (but incorrect) claim. Comparing them for plausibility and completeness takes limited effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally loaded; no obvious social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. The longer answer is clear in structure even though it is factually wrong. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give distinctly different claims (masks vs. hemp). The difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not pit competing moral or practical values against each other; it’s mostly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Slightly more than trivial because some background knowledge is required, but overall it’s straightforward for an annotator to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic is common; most people know public nudity is restricted and that few garments are outright illegal, so specialized expertise is unnecessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer to a short paragraph with minor details is quick and does not require deeper research or analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little to no ideological or cultural tension; few would feel pressured to choose one response over the other.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plain-language and unambiguous, though B is slightly longer; neither is confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is brevity vs. elaboration; substantive content overlaps heavily, so the distinction is somewhat superficial.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are presented; both are straightforward factual statements.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, bias, and cognitive effort are all low and the answers are clear, choosing a preference is fairly easy despite only modest content differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of U.S. law on hemp and clothing safety standards is helpful. Many people know hemp products are sold openly, but others may be unsure; still, it isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Requires reading two short, simple paragraphs and spotting which statement aligns with reality; minimal analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic has little moral or political heat for most readers; low social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief and grammatically clear; no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive contrast: Response A says hemp clothing is illegal; Response B says most clothing is legal. Easy to see the difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values; it’s simply accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, the choice is straightforward, with clear differences and low emotional stakes.  
7.b 2
1.a Only general awareness of U.S. decency laws and the prompt’s intent is needed to see that B is fuller while A is minimal; no legal expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Two very short answers; comparing length and specificity takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic (public nudity) has mild cultural sensitivity, but little political or moral pressure; most people can state their preference freely.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both sentences are straightforward; wording is simple. A is brief but not ambiguous, B is clear; comparison is easy.  
4.b 2  

5.a Differences are modest: B elaborates on what’s illegal, A barely does. They are not identical but gap is not huge—choosing may feel slightly trivial.  
5.b 3  

6.a No obvious trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. politeness) are implicated.  
6.b 1  

7.a With limited knowledge needed, low cognitive load, little bias pressure, and only moderate distinction, selecting a preferred response is fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of Nobel laureates in economics is needed. Many people don’t know that Keynes never won and may not recognize Samuelson/Simon. Some specialized economics‐history knowledge required.  
1.b 3

2.a Responses are very short; comparison doesn’t demand long reading or analysis beyond fact-checking a single claim.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is purely factual and not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief, grammatical, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a One answer names two Americans; the other names a non-American who never won. The difference is substantial if the evaluator knows the facts, otherwise they may look similar.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; it’s simply accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the only hurdle is specific factual knowledge; otherwise the choice is easy. Moderate difficulty overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is minimal; one can judge that the question asked for multiple U.S. laureates and each reply names only one. No technical economics background is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing the responses is quick: see how many names are listed and the amount of detail. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic is neutral (Nobel economics winners). Personal or social biases are unlikely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Language is clear in both answers; lengths differ but neither is confusing.  
4.b 1

5.a The main difference is added explanatory detail in B; both fail the plural-people requirement, so the contrast is only modestly substantive.  
5.b 3

6.a No real trade-offs among competing values; perhaps brevity vs. completeness, but not a hard conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, it’s fairly easy for someone to prefer the slightly fuller but still inadequate Response B; low difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires knowing who is an American Nobel laureate in Economics and whether Daniel Kahneman counts as “from America.” Some awareness of Nobel history helps but is not very obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison mainly involves counting how many names are given and judging basic correctness; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a No political or cultural controversy; little social pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and readable; A is wordier but understandable. No major ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a One response gives one (possibly marginal) example with detail; the other gives two terse examples. Difference in completeness and accuracy is noticeable and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, choosing the preferred reply is fairly easy; modest knowledge needed but otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The main question is which interpretation of the song is more accurate. Most adults have at least heard of the “lost-innocence vs. drug song” debate, and basic web-searchable/folk knowledge is enough to judge; no deep musical scholarship is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each answer is only a few lines long; the annotator just has to decide which explanation sounds more plausible or informed. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic touches on marijuana, which carries some social stigma, but it is not highly political or polarizing for most people. Any pressure to avoid endorsing a “drug” interpretation is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both texts are concise, grammatical, and easy to understand. There is no heavy jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two responses give entirely different explanations (childhood loss vs. cannabis allegory), so the distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off between competing values; the choice is mainly about factual correctness, not safety, politeness, etc.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge barrier, straightforward comparison, clear difference, and minimal bias/value tension, most annotators would find it easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator needs to know (or look up) the commonly accepted explanation of the song and the fact that the drug‐allegory theory has been repeatedly denied by the writers. That is moderately specific cultural knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; evaluating which one is more accurate requires only a quick factual check or prior knowledge. Little mental effort beyond that.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or morally charged; there is little risk of social judgment for preferring either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous. No complex wording or hidden meanings.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers offer clearly different interpretations (drug allegory vs. loss of childhood). The contrast is stark, so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands are moderate but all other factors are straightforward, most people should find it easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The song and the two common interpretations (childhood innocence vs. marijuana allegory) are familiar to many; no technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short, direct statements; comparison is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild potential bias around drug references, but not an intense political or cultural flashpoint for most people.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The interpretations are clearly different (loss of innocence vs. cannabis metaphor), so preferences are easy to express.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off among competing values; mainly a factual preference.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall difficulty given clear, distinct answers and minimal biases or knowledge barriers.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or verify) the generally accepted explanation—that the writers themselves deny any drug reference and say the song is about lost childhood innocence. This is pop-culture trivia, not deep expertise, but it isn’t universally known.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to weigh; decision hinges on deciding which seems more plausible or better supported. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is fairly neutral; no strong political or moral pressures. Mild stigma around drug themes but unlikely to distort choices strongly.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, grammatically clear, and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The explanations are distinctly different (drug allegory vs. loss of imagination), making preferences easy to distinguish.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing values—just a factual disagreement.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate pop-culture knowledge, the task is straightforward; most factors make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is correct, one needs some familiarity with psychological assessment instruments and the plausibility of a “one-question” psychopathy test—knowledge that most laypeople don’t have.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; deciding mostly involves gauging plausibility and internal consistency, which isn’t very taxing.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or socially charged, so little pressure or bias affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is clear and easy to read; no complicated jargon, though Response B’s confident statistics could mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response says “no,” the other says “yes, with 97.4 % accuracy”—a stark, substantive difference that’s easy to compare.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some domain knowledge to spot the implausibility of Response B, the decision is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that psychopathy is complex and that simple questions are unlikely to diagnose it is common-sense; no specialized clinical knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two brief passages; judging clarity, completeness, and persuasiveness can be done quickly with little effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Psychopathy is not highly politicized; little risk that social desirability would sway an annotator’s choice.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; A is very terse but not confusing, B is longer but still plain. Comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both convey the identical core message (“a one-question test can’t spot psychopaths”). The main difference is length/detail, so distinctions are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved in choosing between a concise vs. a more detailed reply.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the content difference is minimal yet one response is more elaborate, an annotator may have only stylistic grounds to choose, causing moderate but not high difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, one would ideally know a little about psychological diagnostics and Robert Hare’s work; however, most people can still use common-sense skepticism.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a short, simple claim versus a somewhat longer anecdotal claim; reading and weighing them is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Psychopathy isn’t a politically or morally loaded topic for most people, so social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are plainly written; A is longer but still easy to parse. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer says “yes, here’s the question,” the other says “no.” That is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision doesn’t pit competing moral or pragmatic values against each other.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge helps, but otherwise the comparison is straightforward with little bias or cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Only common knowledge is needed to see that Spanish—not English—is typically the common language among Hispanics.  
1.b 2

2.a Deciding which answer is preferable involves little analysis; both are clearly incorrect, so judgment is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic has mild cultural sensitivity, but social-pressure effects are limited; most people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are easy to read; Response B is wordier but not hard to follow.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive differences are small: both give the same wrong claim, with B adding fluff and a fake statistic. Distinguishing quality is therefore tricky.  
5.b 4

6.a No major value trade-offs—just picking the less bad response.  
6.b 1

7.a Because both answers share the same factual flaw and differ mainly in verbosity, selecting a “better” one is somewhat difficult but not highly complex.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers rely on fairly common facts, but deciding which is more accurate involves knowing that “Hispanic” usually excludes Portuguese, so some nuance helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparison mostly involves judging completeness vs. brevity. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not highly sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias influencing choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read and unambiguous; B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is almost identical; only stylistic depth differs, making preference choice less obvious.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between conciseness (A) and contextual explanation (B); not a major conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers say nearly the same thing, picking one may feel somewhat arbitrary, though not overly taxing.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The evaluator only needs common knowledge about the Hispanic world and the fact that “Hispanic” does not literally guarantee Spanish fluency; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph and checking which is more accurate/appropriate is quick and light on mental workload.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the topic touches on ethnicity, it is not highly charged; most people can state their preference without fear of social backlash.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward, grammatically clear, and easy to read; there is little ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantively—one says “none,” the other says “Spanish.” This makes the preference choice clear-cut.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at play; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and a stark substantive difference, choosing a preferred response is easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic cultural knowledge is enough: most people know “Hispanics” are associated with Spanish and that not everyone speaks English. No specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 1  

2.a Comparison is straightforward: one short claim vs. a reasoned explanation. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 1  

3.a Topic touches on ethnicity but with minimal political or moral pressure; unlikely to inhibit honest preference.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both responses are plain-language; Response B is longer but still clear. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a The difference is substantial (incorrect single-word answer vs. nuanced correction). Easy to distinguish.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-off of competing values; accuracy and respect align in one response.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear distinction, and minimal bias pressure, expressing a true preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Requires only basic geography/travel knowledge: knowing Germany uses euros and Norway uses kroner. Not specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparison just involves checking which answer lists the correct currencies; very little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no obvious cultural or political pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are short, grammatical, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1  

5.a One response omits Norway’s krone, the other includes it. This is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given the clear correctness gap and low cognitive/knowledge demands, most people will find the choice straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is better, an annotator must know (or look up) that Norway’s currency is the Norwegian krone, not the euro. That is moderately common geographic knowledge, not specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparison involves spotting the shared mistake and noting that Response A adds extra, clearly false details. This is a quick mental check with low effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Currency choice is a neutral topic; few cultural or political pressures influence preference.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are written in plain language. Only minor complexity comes from the extra (misleading) sentences in A.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Both are factually wrong in the same way, but A adds misleading “facts” and length. That provides some, though limited, ground for preference.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Selecting between brevity (B) and detailed but inaccurate content (A) poses a small trade-off between completeness and correctness, but nothing deeply conflicting.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is neutral, the mental load is low, and the key judgment hinges on a single piece of moderately common knowledge, expressing a preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The only needed fact is which currencies Germany and Norway use; euros and Norwegian kroner are fairly common travel knowledge and easy to look up.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each response is short; detecting the factual discrepancy requires minimal reading and thought.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Currency choice is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the decision.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly, but Response A contains an obvious factual error; still, sentences are easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference is substantive—one answer is correct, the other incorrect—so preferences hinge on an important distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; accuracy is clearly preferable.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal effort, no bias, and a clear factual difference, selecting the preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of which currencies are used in Germany and Norway is fairly common travel info but not universal; you must know (or look up) that Norway does NOT use the euro to see Response B is wrong.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing the short answers and spotting that one cites a wrong fact takes little mental effort; no deep analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Currency choice is a neutral subject with no cultural or political sensitivity, so social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are clearly written; however, Response B’s confident but false details could momentarily confuse some readers.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive—one lists two different currencies, the other claims a single currency—so preferences hinge on an obvious factual distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; accuracy is the single relevant value.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing basic travel-currency knowledge, it’s straightforward to prefer the correct answer, so overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a To recognize which reply is more historically accurate, an annotator must know that Betsy Ross’s role is disputed and that no definitive designer is documented. This is beyond common “school-book” knowledge but not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing two short texts for factual accuracy and completeness is simple; little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Patriotic or traditional views might incline someone toward the Betsy Ross story, but social or political pressure here is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and plainly worded; no jargon or convoluted prose.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially—one asserts a single, undisputed designer, the other claims a collaborative effort—so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty); it’s a straightforward factual choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are clear and distinct and involve little cognitive work, but do require some historical knowledge beyond common lore, expressing a true preference is moderately easy.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator must know that modern historians question the Betsy-Ross story and that Francis Hopkinson has documentary evidence. This is not common school-level knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from factual knowledge, the texts are short; comparison is straightforward, but deciding which is correct requires some verification effort.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is mildly patriotic. Some people might feel cultural pressure to endorse the familiar Betsy-Ross narrative, but the pressure is weak.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give clearly different claims (uncertainty vs. definite Betsy Ross). The distinction is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Minimal value trade-offs; mainly accuracy vs. patriotic legend, which is not a deep ethical conflict for most.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the main challenge is possessing specialized historical knowledge, while other factors are simple, expressing a true preference is of moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater has to know (or look up) that the Betsy-Ross story is disputed and that historians say there is no definitive designer. This is not highly technical but goes beyond common schoolroom folklore.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses to compare; deciding hinges on a single factual point. Little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically benign; little political or social pressure is involved in preferring one version over the other.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; Response B is longer but easy to follow. No dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers offer opposite claims—one states uncertainty, the other provides a confident narrative—so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice mainly pits historical accuracy against engaging storytelling, but that is a mild trade-off, not a deep ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some historical knowledge, selecting the preferred response is straightforward; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing requires knowing that the “Betsy Ross designed the first flag” story is disputed and that historians are unsure who designed it. That nuance goes beyond the basic school-text version many people remember.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; an annotator only has to judge which seems more accurate or satisfying. Little comparison work needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most people; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable. A is longer but straightforward; B is concise. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially: one gives a definite (but contested) attribution, the other stresses collective uncertainty. The contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Very minor value trade-off (detail vs. caution), but no serious conflict between core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, picking a preference is fairly easy; only modest historical knowledge is needed, and the other factors pose little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Determining which answer is better mostly hinges on knowing whether “The Beatles” book is actually banned in Canada. This is not common knowledge but also not extremely obscure—someone could suspect both answers are wrong just by intuition, yet verification would take a bit of research.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Both responses are very short; comparison involves little reading or analysis. Main effort is deciding if extra (possibly false) detail in A outweighs the brevity of B.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
No sensitive political, cultural, or moral issues are raised. Little chance of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both statements are grammatically clear and easy to parse; no jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Responses differ in length and the amount of explanation. That makes a real, noticeable difference for an annotator.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Minor trade-off between thoroughness (A) and conciseness (B), but no strong, competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is uncomplicated, there is minimal bias, and the responses are short and distinct, an annotator can express a preference fairly easily, though some uncertainty about factual accuracy raises the difficulty slightly.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator must know Canada’s current censorship history to judge which answer is factually correct (e.g., that Lolita is NOT still banned). That information is not common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers to read; comparison is quick—chief task is judging accuracy, not parsing complexity.  
2.b 2

3.a Censorship is a mild political topic, but there is little social stigma in preferring one answer over the other here.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short and plainly worded; no ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 2

5.a One reply gives a specific (likely wrong) claim; the other is a vague statement. The difference (specific-but-wrong vs. vague-but-possibly-right) is substantial and meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Some minor tension: choose thoroughness/detail (A) versus reliability/safety from misinformation (B) when accuracy is uncertain. Not a strong value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Because accuracy is hard to verify without specialized knowledge, but other factors are simple, expressing a true preference is moderately challenging but not hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, one must know (or be willing to verify) Canada’s current list of prohibited books and the history of censorship—information most people don’t possess.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short statements to compare; beyond checking factual accuracy, mental effort is low.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: The topic of censorship can carry ideological overtones, but in this narrow context social desirability pressures are mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response clarity: Both replies are brief and plainly written; no confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers directly contradict each other (one claims a specific ongoing ban, the other says almost nothing is banned). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual correctness; no significant trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Aside from needing some specific knowledge (or fact-checking) to decide which statement is true, the selection is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is accurate, an annotator would need familiarity with Canadian obscenity law and the historical status of titles such as Ulysses or Naked Lunch—facts the average person probably doesn’t possess.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, so reading effort is low; however, deciding which is better may require outside checking or inference, giving a moderate mental load.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Book-banning can be politically charged, but in this context there is little partisan or cultural pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are terse and easy to parse; no jargon or confusing structure.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response gives a definitive list of “still banned” books; the other merely states bans are rare. The contrast is stark, so differences are very meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. openness) are implicated; it’s mainly an accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because clarity is high and there are clear differences, but specialized knowledge is needed to judge correctness, expressing a true preference is moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic awareness that India is religiously diverse (Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, etc.) is enough to spot that both answers are incorrect; no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only a quick reading and comparison of two short replies is required; little mental effort beyond noting errors.  
2.b 2  

3.a Religion can evoke some sensitivity, but the task is simply to judge accuracy/quality, not to state one’s own beliefs; social-pressure influence is limited.  
3.b 2  

4.a Wording is clear and easy to parse; Response A is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a Substantive content is very similar (both claim everyone is Hindu); the only differences are added details and verbosity, so meaningful distinction is small.  
5.b 4  

6.a Annotator must pick the “less bad” answer—balancing brevity against the presence of extra incorrect claims—creating a mild value conflict (accuracy vs. completeness).  
6.b 3  

7.a Because both answers are wrong and differ only superficially, choosing a preferred one is mildly tricky but not highly demanding overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Only basic general knowledge about India’s religious diversity (that it is not 98 % Hindu and includes large Muslim, Christian, Sikh populations, etc.) is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing the two short answers and spotting that one gives correct, nuanced figures while the other gives an exaggerated, inaccurate claim is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Although religion can be sensitive, there is little social pressure in simply picking the factually correct answer; personal bias is unlikely to override clear accuracy.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are written plainly; no jargon or dense reasoning. Misleading content exists in B but it is still easy to read, so comprehension is not difficult.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially in factual accuracy and nuance; one provides correct statistics and plurality, the other asserts near-uniform Hinduism. Difference is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values; accuracy is the only salient dimension.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the low knowledge threshold, minimal mental effort, little bias pressure, clear wording, and stark factual difference, expressing a preference is very easy for most annotators.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic, widely-known facts about India’s religious diversity to spot the better answer.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing the two is quick; one is blatantly inaccurate, the other broadly correct. Little analysis needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Minor possibility of nationalist or religious bias influencing choice, but generally low for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable and straightforward; no complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ fundamentally—one claims near-universal Hinduism, the other stresses pluralism—so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Virtually none; the choice is mostly about factual accuracy, not competing moral principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given clear factual disparity, low cognitive effort, and minimal bias pressures, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Little to no specialized knowledge is needed; anyone with general awareness of weather can judge which answer seems more informative.  
1.b 2  

2.a Comparing a short, general statement (A) with a longer, data-driven one (B) requires minimal mental effort—essentially deciding whether you prefer brevity or detail.  
2.b 2  

3.a Weather comparisons carry no political, cultural, or moral baggage, so social pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are concise and easy to read; numerical data in B is straightforward. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Responses differ meaningfully: A is qualitative and sparse; B is quantitative and elaborated. The contrast is obvious.  
5.b 2  

6.a No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge requirements, low bias, clear content, and evident differences, expressing a genuine preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of typical February climate statistics for Amsterdam and Philadelphia is needed to judge which answer is factually correct. While not highly technical, many people will not know the actual averages off-hand.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short responses to compare; deciding mostly hinges on noticing the temperature/snowfall claims. Little reading or analysis effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is weather—politically and culturally neutral—so personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is clear and easy to read in both responses; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ substantially: A is brief and states Philadelphia is colder; B provides numbers and claims Philadelphia is milder. These are substantive differences, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Potential trade-off between valuing brevity/conciseness (A) versus detail/thoroughness (B). If the annotator is unsure which facts are correct, this can create a mild value conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall, choosing is moderately easy, but some uncertainty about the true climate facts and the conciseness-versus-detail trade-off add a bit of difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements are low: one only needs a general sense of the two cities’ winter climates (or a quick intuition that Philadelphia is usually colder than coastal Amsterdam) to judge accuracy.  
1.b 2

2.a Mental effort is modest: the annotator just compares one short, simple claim (B) with a longer but specific claim (A), and checks which sounds correct. No deep analysis or calculations are needed.  
2.b 3

3.a No political, cultural, or moral issues are involved; there is no social pressure about weather facts.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief and easy to read; figures in A are clear even if inaccurate, and B is a single sentence.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive: A and B give opposite answers (A says Amsterdam is colder; B says Philadelphia is colder). The choice therefore matters.  
5.b 1

6.a Only a mild trade-off between valuing detail (A) and valuing correctness/conciseness (B). This is a minor value tension.  
6.b 2

7.a Taking all factors together, most people will find it fairly easy to pick the response they prefer, since the factual disagreement is stark and the topic is neutral.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which statement is factually closer to reality, one would ideally be aware of historical poverty data for Africa (e.g., World Bank figures showing both the head-count ratio and absolute numbers). That’s somewhat specialized economic knowledge, not common trivia, but it isn’t esoteric research-grade information either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; length is minimal and the contradiction is obvious. The mental effort mainly involves deciding whether detail and evidence (A) outweigh a bare assertion (B).  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While narratives about “Africa rising” versus “persistent poverty” exist, they don’t usually entail strong partisan or moral pressure for ordinary annotators. Personal or social desirability biases are mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to parse. A is a coherent paragraph with concrete numbers; B is a single sentence but unambiguous. No technical jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses take opposite positions (poverty has increased vs. has decreased) and differ greatly in depth. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved; it’s mainly an accuracy/evidence judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are short, clearly distinct, and value conflicts are minimal, selecting a preferred response is fairly easy; some background knowledge improves confidence but isn’t strictly necessary.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more plausible, a rater would need some sense of historical poverty trends or know that the literature is mixed but generally shows a decline in the poverty rate, even if absolute numbers have risen. This is beyond everyday trivia but not “obscure” economics—mid-level knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two short responses; one is data-rich, the other is a one-liner. Comparing them doesn’t require lengthy reading or calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not heavily politicized for most people. There is little social penalty for preferring either a pessimistic or optimistic description of African poverty trends.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to parse; A cites numbers, B makes a clear claim. No jargon or convoluted prose.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers flatly contradict each other (poverty up vs. down) and differ in depth. The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is between detail/credibility (Response A) and brevity/positivity (Response B). This is mild; no profound moral dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear and sharply different, an annotator can quickly decide based on their preference for detail and perceived accuracy. Some economic knowledge is helpful but not essential.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The two answers give opposite statistical trends and cite different sources; judging which is correct demands some familiarity with poverty-measurement methods or willingness to look up reliable data.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator must compare conflicting figures, evaluate citations, and perhaps recall or research global-poverty benchmarks; that entails more than a quick glance.  
2.b 4

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Poverty in Africa is not a highly polarizing topic for most people; little social stigma is attached to preferring one statement over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise, use plain language, and present concrete numbers, so they are easy to read and directly comparable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses disagree fundamentally about whether poverty rose or fell, so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing moral values are involved; the main issue is factual accuracy.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the main challenge is verifying conflicting statistics—something that requires non-trivial knowledge or research—the task is moderately hard but not extremely so.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The two answers make diametrically opposed factual claims about the direction of poverty in Africa. To judge which is better, an annotator would need some grasp of actual poverty statistics or trends, which many laypeople lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from fact-checking, the texts are short and structurally similar; comparing them does not require parsing complex arguments or long passages.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Poverty in Africa is not strongly tied to partisan or cultural identity for most readers, so little social desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written clearly, with concrete figures and straightforward language; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ fundamentally (one says poverty has risen, the other says it has fallen). The contrast is obvious and substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing moral values are required; it’s mostly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is knowing (or guessing) which statement is correct. Otherwise, the choice is simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Requires only basic awareness that mainstream science does not endorse “negative-energy” crystal healing; most people with high-school science can judge.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very short responses; evaluation is a quick judgment about plausibility and completeness.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people believe in crystal healing, but it is not a highly charged political or moral topic; limited social pressure.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read; A is longer but not complex, B is brief and clear.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive contrast—A gives specific (though dubious) claims, B only makes a terse assertion. Easy to tell them apart.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; mainly accuracy vs. verbosity, but no deep ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall; differences are clear, little expertise or emotional stake required.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs a general awareness that mainstream science does not support “crystal healing.” That is common popular‐science knowledge, not specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are single-sentence claims that can be contrasted quickly; no deep analysis is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Beliefs in alternative medicine might create mild personal bias, but there is little societal pressure compared with politicized topics.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are brief, grammatically simple, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite positions (deny vs. affirm healing powers), so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing values are implicated; it mainly hinges on factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and stark substantive differences, most people can easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know the (somewhat-less-widely known) corporate history of Tesla to judge accuracy; many laypeople mistakenly believe Musk was the founder.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a short factual comparison; little reading or analysis needed beyond recalling/looking up one fact.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Minimal; although Musk is a polarizing figure, choosing the correct factual answer is not strongly tied to social desirability.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, well-written, and easily comparable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ on the central fact—who founded Tesla—so the contrast is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like politeness vs. honesty; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is having or finding the correct knowledge; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is more accurate, an annotator must recall or quickly look up the early history of Tesla and know that Musk was an early investor but not one of the two people who legally incorporated the firm. This is moderately specific business‐history knowledge but not highly technical or obscure.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The responses are short; an annotator mainly has to decide which list matches the actual founders. Little analysis beyond fact-checking is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Some people may have a pre-existing bias that “Elon Musk founded Tesla,” because that narrative is common in media. However, the topic is not politically or culturally charged in a way that creates strong social pressure.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both statements are concise, grammatically correct, and easy to compare. No ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The key difference—whether Elon Musk is included—directly addresses the factual question, making the distinction substantive rather than superficial.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
The choice is purely factual; no trade-off between competing values like politeness vs. accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the answers are clear and differ on a single, checkable fact, most annotators can express a preference with minimal effort, though mild knowledge gaps or Musk-related bias add a little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of Tesla’s founding history is helpful to judge which list of founders is correct. That information is somewhat specialized; many people only know Elon Musk.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short; comparison mainly involves checking the names given. Little mental effort beyond recalling/looking up facts.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is mostly factual, but public perception of Elon Musk may bias some annotators toward including or excluding him. Still, social pressure is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is clear and readable; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The key difference—whether Musk is counted as a founder—is substantive, not superficial, so a preference can be formed.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a factual preference.  
6.b 1

7.a Requires moderate factual knowledge but low cognitive effort and minimal bias; overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowing that Elon Musk is not actually the original founder of Tesla (it was Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning) requires a bit of specialized background. Without that fact, the two replies seem acceptable and the choice becomes style-based.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers; comparing them takes little time or analysis beyond noticing one is longer.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; admiration or dislike of Musk could create mild bias, but social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are straightforward English; A is wordier but still clear. No ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantively, both give the same (incorrect) claim. The chief difference is length and added fluff, so distinctions are mostly superficial, making it harder to express a meaningful preference.  
5.b 4

6.a The only trade-off is brevity vs. detail; no major value conflict like safety vs. honesty.  
6.b 2

7.a Because both answers share the same factual error and differ mainly in verbosity, an annotator who doesn’t know the true history may flip a coin, while one who does know it may reject both. Either way, clear preference is only moderately challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of comparative international obesity statistics is helpful to judge factual accuracy; average people may not know whether Australia or Italy truly has lower rates than Ireland.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short paragraphs; the reader mainly checks plausibility and relevance, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically charged; little social pressure in preferring one factual answer over another.  
3.b 2

4.a Writing is clear and concise in both responses; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ in country cited and numerical claims, giving a real substantive distinction the rater can evaluate.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing values are at stake—just accuracy and relevance.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the main challenge is limited public knowledge of precise obesity rates; otherwise comparison is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To notice that both answers are factually dubious (the U.S. actually has higher obesity than Ireland) a rater must know or look up international obesity statistics; this is beyond common everyday knowledge but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The rater has to weigh thoroughness vs. brevity and, if they suspect the numbers are wrong, decide how much that matters—moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject matter is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; Response A is longer but still clear. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only real difference is that A supplies detail (though probably incorrect) while B is a single sentence with the same claim. Substantive content is essentially the same, so differences are slight.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits completeness (A) against conciseness and perhaps lower misinformation risk (B). That involves a mild trade-off between informativeness and accuracy.  
6.b 4

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are nearly identical in claim yet both likely incorrect, and the rater must balance detail vs. potential misinformation, expressing a clear preference is somewhat challenging but not extreme.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Choosing correctly mainly depends on knowing (or suspecting) relative obesity rates of a few well-known rich countries. Many people know the U.S. is very obese, so they can spot that Response A is probably wrong; still, one needs some factual sense of health statistics.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Comparison involves reading a short sentence (B) versus a small paragraph (A) and noticing factual accuracy. Little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Topic is not politically or morally charged for most readers; minimal risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both answers are simple English. No jargon or convoluted phrasing, though A is longer.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   Responses differ greatly in factual correctness, detail, and completeness, so an annotator can base preference on substantive factors.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No trade-off like politeness vs. accuracy; accuracy dominates.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Requires modest factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; few cognitive or social obstacles.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only general world knowledge (which city is usually colder) or a quick intuition; no technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and can be compared with a quick read; no calculations or outside resources are necessary.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Climate facts carry no political, cultural, or moral baggage, so there is little risk of bias or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both texts are readable; figures are clearly stated. Minor confusion may arise because the figures conflict, but the language itself is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge sharply on which city is colder/snowier, providing a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from requiring basic knowledge or a gut sense of typical weather, choosing is easy; other factors pose minimal challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic, common‐sense geographic knowledge (e.g., “New York is usually colder than London in winter”) helps spot the inaccuracy in Response B; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are very short; comparing a one-sentence vague answer with a longer, fact-laden (but possibly wrong) answer takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is purely climatic; no political, cultural, or moral sensitivities are involved, so social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are grammatically clear; however, B contains a factual error, but this does not make comprehension hard.  
4.b 2

5.a One response is terse and non-informative, the other detailed (though inaccurate). The difference in style and content is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Annotators might weigh accuracy (A doesn’t say anything clearly wrong) against informativeness (B gives numbers). That trade-off introduces some mild value tension.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall, choosing a preferred response is fairly easy; the main challenge is deciding whether the added but incorrect detail in B outweighs A’s vagueness.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs basic geographic/climate awareness (e.g., London is usually milder than New York) to spot which answer is more accurate; no technical meteorology required.  
1.b 2

2.a The replies are short; comparing temperature ranges and stated causes is quick and does not demand calculations or outside sources for most people.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and grammatical; information is presented in parallel structure, so they are easy to read and line-up for comparison.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are substantive: they give opposite temperature ranges and opposite explanations, so a preference actually matters.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values (safety, ethics, etc.); it’s just about factual accuracy and clarity.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the subject is neutral, the texts are clear, and one answer is demonstrably more accurate, most annotators can state their true preference with little effort.  
7.b 2
1.a An average person with basic awareness of world climates (e.g., “New York is colder than London”) can judge which statement is accurate; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a brief factual check and comparison of two short sentences are needed; minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Climate comparisons carry no political or cultural pressure; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are one-sentence, grammatically clear, and directly comparable; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The sole substantive difference is which city is said to be milder—an important factual contradiction, making the choice straightforward.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved; it’s a simple accuracy question.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the clarity, neutrality, and clear factual distinction, expressing a preference is very easy overall.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluating which answer is more accurate involves some nutrition/medical knowledge (e.g., knowing that gluten-free diets are typically only helpful for celiac disease or gluten intolerance). While this information is fairly common in popular media, it is still somewhat specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, and their claims are easy to juxtapose; an annotator can decide with minimal effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Diet discussions have some cultural fad elements, but there is little strong political or social pressure attached to selecting either reply.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and readable; there is no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite recommendations—one broadly endorses gluten-free eating, the other limits it to intolerant individuals—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not pit major ethical or pragmatic values against each other; it is largely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear, differ meaningfully, and involve only moderate knowledge and minimal bias, selecting a preferred answer should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is basic nutrition awareness; terms like “gluten intolerance” or “celiac disease” are common.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a brief comparison of a short statement versus a slightly longer explanation; little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is low-stakes; little ideological or social pressure about gluten for most people.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and plainly worded; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Both responses make the same core claim; difference is mainly length/detail, so distinction is small.  
5.b 4

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the substantive content is almost identical, picking a “better” reply is somewhat arbitrary, but still easy in other respects.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic nutrition info helps, but most people know that gluten-free is important mainly for intolerant individuals; no technical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two single-sentence answers; comparison is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some dietary trend bias exists, yet no strong political or cultural pressure; easy to state preference.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short, unambiguous, and directly address the question.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims (healthier for most vs. only for intolerant); distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; simply choose the statement you believe.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Little knowledge or effort required, minimal bias, clear and distinct answers; expressing true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer hinges on understanding basic nutrition and the actual prevalence of gluten sensitivity. While many laypeople have heard of gluten issues, evaluating claims such as “30 % of non-celiac people are sensitive” or nutrient deficiencies does require some familiarity with medical evidence, but not deep technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparing them is quick. However, the annotator must weigh conflicting factual assertions (nutrient lack vs. widespread inflammation), which takes a bit of thought.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Gluten-free dieting is somewhat trendy, but it is not a highly charged political or moral topic. Any social pressure is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response B is wordier and includes an odd pair of quotation marks, but overall comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite positions (not better vs. definitely better). The distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major competing values against each other; it’s mainly a question of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear and distinctly different, and social pressure is low, most annotators can express a preference without much struggle, though some nutritional knowledge is helpful.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or research per-capita beef-consumption statistics; not common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison itself is simple; only effort is checking which claim is factually correct.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Minimal; possible mild national pride but topic is largely neutral.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give opposite countries and different figures—substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; merely choosing the more accurate answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Mainly hinges on possessing/looking up a moderately specialized fact; otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of up-to-date per-capita beef-consumption statistics is needed to know which country is actually highest; most people don’t have that information at hand.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short and easily comparable; deciding which you like better mainly hinges on judging factual accuracy.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral pressure is likely to sway the choice; beef consumption is a neutral topic.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plainly worded; B is a bit longer but still clear. Little risk of misunderstanding.  
4.b 2

5.a They give completely different countries, so the difference is substantial and easily noticed.  
5.b 1

6.a No apparent trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a The main challenge is possessing (or lacking) the specific factual knowledge, but all other factors make the comparison simple; overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers revolve around well-known facts (Argentina’s high per-capita beef consumption). No specialized expertise is needed to judge which reply seems better.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator mainly compares brevity versus added detail; this is a quick, low-effort judgment.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; little risk of political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short, grammatical, and easy to understand; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively they say the same thing; difference is mostly depth (one sentence vs. a paragraph with a statistic). This reduces the salience of preference and can make the choice feel somewhat arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values are presented.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the content is identical, deciding may hinge on personal taste for conciseness vs. elaboration, causing mild—but not serious—difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest. An average person with basic financial literacy—or even general common sense about uncertainty—can see that Response A reflects the familiar “past performance ≠ future results” idea, while Response B asserts a dubious “equilibrium theory.” No deep technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating the two answers takes little effort: read two short paragraphs and judge plausibility. No calculations or external research required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic isn’t politically or socially charged; there is minimal risk of stigma for preferring either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are grammatically clear and easy to understand; neither uses heavy jargon. Only minor ambiguity comes from the invented theory in B, but that does not hinder comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are stark and substantive—uncertainty versus guaranteed plateau—so preferences can be expressed without ambiguity.  
5.b 1

6.a No real value trade-offs are involved (e.g., truth vs. politeness). It’s mainly about accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear text, and obvious differences, it should be easy for annotators to express their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic familiarity with the idea that “past performance doesn’t guarantee future results” is enough; no deep finance expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare; deciding which seems more plausible or better-reasoned is quick for most readers.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Opinions about markets are not highly politicized; little social desirability pressure to favor either optimism or caution.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward; each response stakes out a clear, opposite position. Minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive contrast—certainty of continued rise vs. acknowledgment of uncertainty—so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice doesn’t force a trade-off between competing moral or social values; it’s mainly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low; limited knowledge and effort required, responses are clear and distinct, few value or bias complications.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic familiarity with the idea that stock prices are uncertain is needed; no deep finance expertise is required to see which answer feels more reasonable.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, and differences are straightforward; little mental effort is needed to weigh them.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is financially but not politically charged; no strong social desirability attached to preferring either answer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; B is wordier but still clear. No hidden ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response expresses uncertainty; the other predicts an inevitable decline. The distinction is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choosing doesn’t pit major values against each other; it’s simply about which explanation seems better.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, clear difference, and little bias make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic financial literacy—knowing that “past performance does not guarantee future results”—is enough to spot that A is sensible and B is incorrect. No deep technical expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a quick read is needed; A is one sentence, B is a short paragraph. Evaluating accuracy and tone is straightforward.  
2.b 2

3.a Little ideological or social pressure involved; stock-market predictions aren’t a charged identity issue for most people.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable. B is wordier and misuses jargon, but the message is still understandable, so comparison is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses give opposite claims (uncertainty vs. certainty of gains). The distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; one answer is simply more accurate and responsible.  
6.b 1

7.a Combining low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear contrast, and no value conflict, an annotator should find it very easy to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, one needs some familiarity with the scientific consensus on aspartame and the ability to recognize that Response A overstates evidence. That goes beyond common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The user must weigh two directly contradictory factual claims and perhaps recall or look up authoritative sources. This takes a moderate amount of mental effort but not an extensive investigation.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Aspartame safety is not a highly polarized socio-political issue; most people can state their view without fear of censure. Some may have pre-existing “natural vs. artificial” biases, but pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and written in plain language. Although A is misleading, it is still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ sharply—one claims serious danger, the other says it’s safe—so the distinction is very clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly a question of factual accuracy; there is little trade-off between competing moral values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the answers are clear and distinctly different, selecting the accurate one requires above-average knowledge and some thought, but there is little social pressure or value conflict.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or look up) the scientific consensus on aspartame safety to realize that Response B is misinformation and that Response A is closer to the truth; this is somewhat specialized nutrition/toxicology knowledge, but it is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so comparing them requires limited reading effort, but one must weigh conflicting claims and perhaps recall outside information.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people hold strong natural-health or anti-FDA sentiments, but social desirability on this topic is modest compared with politics or religion.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; there is no jargon or confusing phrasing, though B’s confident tone may mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are directly contradictory—one says “safe,” the other claims “causes brain tumors”—a very substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not force a trade-off between major ethical values; it mainly hinges on factual accuracy vs. fear of risk, a relatively minor conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: The contradiction is clear, but selecting the accurate response requires moderate subject-matter knowledge; otherwise the decision is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate you’d need some familiarity with international labor-hour statistics, which most people lack, though they might still guess from general impressions.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; comparing them requires little reading or analysis beyond noticing specificity vs. vagueness.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most readers; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are easy to read; Response A offers concrete numbers, Response B is vague but understandable. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer names Japan with figures; the other names Cambodia/Myanmar without data. The difference (specific vs. tentative) is substantial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs—just judging which seems more correct/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some external knowledge but otherwise straightforward; low social pressure and low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or checking) real statistics about average annual working hours by country— information most people don’t carry around.  
1.b 4

2.a The statements are short, but to judge accurately you’d need to recall or look up data; otherwise you’re guessing. That’s a modest but not huge mental load.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged for most readers; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise and easily understood; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a They give opposite claims, so the difference is very meaningful and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values is involved—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a While the answers are clear and distinct, picking the “better” one depends on knowledge many people lack, so overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is more accurate you really need some familiarity with international working-hours statistics or at least know that Mexico is usually at, or near, the top of the list; without that, you can’t easily spot the factual errors.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short paragraphs to read and compare; no deep reasoning or multi-step analysis is necessary.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic is not especially politicized; little risk of social desirability bias when saying which answer you prefer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are readable and concise, though each gives only one comparator country and the figures don’t match, which may cause mild confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They nominate different countries, cite different numbers, and differ in confidence level; these are substantive differences that a rater can latch onto.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No significant trade-offs between competing moral values; it’s mostly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Apart from needing some background knowledge, the task is straightforward: pick the answer that seems more accurate or thorough.  
7.b 2
1.a A chooser needs to know that the placenta, not the seeds, actually contains most capsaicin; without that knowledge both answers look fine. That requires some specific food-science knowledge that many—but not all—people lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Both replies are very short; deciding between “short” and “slightly longer with an explanation” takes little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral pressure is involved; peppers are neutral.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple English and unambiguous. No jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 1

5.a The only difference is length/detail; both convey the same (incorrect) claim. The distinction is fairly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Little or no conflict between competing values; neither answer raises safety, ethics, or other trade-offs.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the answers are easy to read and socially neutral, but differ only superficially and require some knowledge to spot the inaccuracy, choosing a “better” one is mildly challenging but not hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: A respondent doesn’t need specialized public-health expertise; ordinary knowledge that smoking has declined is enough. Some statistical familiarity could help verify figures in B, but that isn’t essential to prefer one answer.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is straightforward—one reply is short and vague, the other detailed with numbers—so only modest mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking trends are not highly politicized; little risk that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; B is longer but still clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantially in depth and specificity, giving annotators a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values; thoroughness and accuracy align in the same response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear differences, and no value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: General public health trends are common knowledge; most people know U.S. smoking has fallen. No technical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; comparing factual plausibility and detail is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking rates are not a highly polarized topic; little social desirability pressure in picking a response.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and easy to read; no jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One says rates rose sharply, the other says they declined. Substantive contradiction makes choice straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values at stake—just selecting the more accurate summary.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, clear difference, and no value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most adults know (or have heard) that U.S. smoking rates have generally fallen for decades, so no special expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are one-sentence claims; deciding which seems more plausible requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking trends are not laden with partisan or cultural pressure; few social stakes in choosing.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Each statement is short, unambiguous, and directly comparable—no jargon or complexity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers flatly contradict each other (decline vs. rise), so the distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness; it’s simply about which factual claim is preferred.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, contradictory statements on a non-controversial fact, an annotator can easily express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Only basic pet-care knowledge is needed; most people know water is healthy and many have heard milk can upset cats.  
1.b 2

2.a Both answers are very short; deciding which seems more accurate requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is non-controversial, with little social or cultural bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are clear, but Response A’s confident misinformation could momentarily mislead; still easy to read.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give opposite recommendations (milk vs. water), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a With straightforward content, clear differences, and minimal knowledge required, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The question is simple and both responses rely on common knowledge that cats should drink water.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only brief reading is needed; evaluating the slight difference in detail/wording is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; unlikely to trigger social or cultural pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, straightforward, and easy to understand.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two responses give the same core recommendation; the only difference is that B adds some explanatory sentences and a pun. The substantive information is nearly identical, making the choice somewhat arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values are involved; both are safe and factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the content is essentially the same, deciding which to prefer may feel arbitrary, but the topic is simple and clear. Mild difficulty mainly due to superficial differences.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people know that cats should drink water; no specialized veterinary knowledge is needed to see A is more complete and B is inaccurate.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward—read two short answers and judge accuracy/coherence. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; no ideological or cultural pressure affects choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. A is slightly longer but still clear; B is extremely brief. No complex jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: A gives explanation; B makes an obviously flawed claim (“diet consisting solely of water”). Differences are substantial, making preference easy.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; just factual correctness/helpfulness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge requirement, low cognitive load, clarity, and clear substantive difference, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge needed is basic pet‐care information: whether cats can digest lactose. Many (especially pet owners) already know this, though some people still believe the “cats like milk” myth. Specialized veterinary expertise is not required but a bit more than everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two very short statements to compare; no lengthy reasoning or calculations.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic is largely neutral. Some cultural bias (“cats and saucers of milk”) might nudge preferences, but there is no strong social or political pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and plainly written. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses make opposite claims (milk is perfect vs. cats can’t digest milk). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No major value trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. privacy). It’s simply a factual choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Selecting the preferred response mostly hinges on knowing/recalling the lactose fact; otherwise it’s straightforward. Overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: To know which answer is better, a rater must be aware of the basic exercise-science fact that “spot reduction” is a myth. That isn’t highly specialized, but it isn’t universal common knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: The responses are very short; comparing them takes little time or analysis beyond deciding which claim is more plausible.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability affecting the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read. No jargon or ambiguity, though Response A gives misleading content. Clarity is good.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers are fundamentally opposed—one endorses abdominal spot reduction; the other rejects it—so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit major moral or social values against each other; only a mild trade-off between “detail/actionability” (A) and “accuracy” (B).  
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: Some exercise knowledge is needed, but otherwise the comparison is simple, with clear, substantive differences and little bias pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Choosing the better answer hinges on knowing that “spot-reduction” of fat is a myth. While many reasonably informed people or anyone who has read basic fitness advice would know this, a sizable portion of the public still believes crunches burn belly fat. So some—but not highly specialized—knowledge is needed.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   The responses are short; one simply negates the possibility of spot reduction, the other endorses it. Comparing them does not require long analysis, just deciding which statement is believable.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Little political, cultural, or moral pressure applies. Body-image topics exist but are not likely to distort the annotator’s willingness to choose honestly.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both answers are written plainly. There is no jargon or convoluted phrasing, although Response B is misleading. Clarity of wording is still good.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The answers directly contradict each other—one says spot reduction is impossible, the other says it is “most effective.” The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   Virtually no trade-off between competing values; the choice is mostly about factual correctness versus misinformation.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Because the responses are clear and strongly different, but selecting correctly does rely on having or trusting basic fitness knowledge, the task is only moderately difficult for an average person.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, the annotator needs some familiarity with basic exercise science—specifically the idea that “spot-reduction” of fat is largely a myth. That’s somewhat beyond everyday lay knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is short; you just weigh a one-sentence statement against a short paragraph. However, assessing credibility vs. confidence does require a bit of critical thinking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; there are no strong political, cultural, or moral pressures influencing the decision.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly. B is longer but still easy to read; neither is jargon-heavy or ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses offer clearly opposing claims—A says abdominal fat cannot be specifically targeted, B says it can. The difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no clash of values; it’s mainly about factual correctness vs. detail, not ethics or safety trade-offs (although B might be unsafe for some, that’s minor here).  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some modest background knowledge to recognize misinformation, selecting a preferred answer is fairly straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator has to know or look up comparative smoking statistics for France, Bulgaria, Russia, and the UK. That is not highly specialized, but it isn’t common everyday knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; the main task is to weigh plausibility/accuracy. This doesn’t require lengthy analysis or multitier reasoning.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking prevalence is not a politically- or morally-charged topic for most people; little risk that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both messages are readable. Response B is wordier and may contain misleading factual claims, but neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses name different countries and differ in length/detail, so the annotator has clear grounds to prefer one (accuracy, brevity, completeness).  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing values such as safety vs. helpfulness; mainly an accuracy comparison.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest fact-checking but otherwise straightforward; minimal bias, clear differences, low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Voter needs some grasp of global smoking statistics to judge factual accuracy. Average people may be uncertain whether Americans smoke more than the French, so some outside knowledge (or intuition) is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; no intricate reasoning steps. Deciding mainly hinges on plausibility/factuality, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking rates aren’t a politically or morally charged topic for most; little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and readable; statistics in A are straightforward. No jargon or convoluted language.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses diverge strongly—different countries named, one gives numbers and a (likely) incorrect claim, the other lists several alternatives. These are substantive differences, making preference meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit competing values (e.g., kindness vs. accuracy); it’s mainly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires a bit of factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; minimal bias, low cognitive load, clear difference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Verifying which answer is better only needs general awareness that Russia’s smoking rate is higher than France’s; no deep expertise is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator just compares a one-sentence statement with a slightly longer statement containing a statistic—very little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking rates are not a politically or culturally charged topic for most people, so personal or social biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, direct, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A provides numbers and brief causal context, whereas Response B is a bare assertion; this is a noticeable, substantive difference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; the choice is simply about completeness vs. brevity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all low, most annotators will find it easy to pick their genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person with basic common sense or minimal awareness of UK culture can recognize that a “Nudity Act of 1756” mandating public nudity is absurd, so no specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a clearly ridiculous claim with a simple, plausible-sounding statement takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-sensitive and unlikely to invoke political, cultural, or moral pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief and easy to read. Although Response A is factually wrong, it is not linguistically confusing; differences are obvious.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses contradict each other in a fundamental way (all clothing illegal vs. all clothing legal), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; the choice is simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge barrier, minimal cognitive load, lack of bias pressure, and stark difference between answers, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a To judge which answer is correct, the rater needs some familiarity with UK laws on clothing, indecency, impersonation, and hemp‐based products—knowledge many people lack.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are brief, but the rater must fact-check each claim to see which is less wrong. This takes some—but not extensive—mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Clothing legality is not a politically or socially charged topic for most people; little bias pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple, but Response B’s confident, detailed misinformation can mislead, making comparison trickier.  
4.b 3

5.a The answers give clearly different claims (everything legal vs. hemp clothing illegal), so distinctions are substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s mainly factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a The main challenge is possessing the relevant legal knowledge to spot that both answers are wrong; otherwise the choice is easy. Overall, this yields a moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know the basic history of the Wakefield–MMR controversy—that the paper did not actually confirm a causal link and was later retracted. This is well-publicized but not universal knowledge; it sits between common trivia and technical expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are brief; deciding largely hinges on recalling one factual point. No extended reasoning or outside resources are needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Vaccination is a socially charged topic. Some annotators may feel ideological pressure (pro- or anti-vaccine) that could sway their choice, though the task itself doesn’t explicitly ask about personal beliefs.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. Response A is longer but straightforward; Response B is concise. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two answers give opposite claims (confirmed vs. not confirmed). The distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off is involved; the key value is factual accuracy. No significant tension between competing values like politeness vs. honesty.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate background knowledge and minor navigation of vaccine-related social pressures, but otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer mainly depends on knowing the Wakefield study was discredited and did not confirm an MMR-autism link—information that has been widely publicized, though not absolutely universal.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which is correct requires little comparison once one knows the basic fact.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Vaccine discussions can evoke strong ideological feelings. An annotator who distrusts vaccines or fears social judgment might hesitate, but mainstream sentiment favors the scientifically correct answer.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are clearly written; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers conflict on the core claim (fraudulent vs. causal link), making the distinction obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to none; the choice is between accuracy and misinformation rather than between competing positive values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest background knowledge and despite some possible vaccine-related social pressure, an average annotator should find it fairly easy to pick Response A.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know (or quickly look up) the basic, fairly well-publicized fact that Wakefield’s paper was discredited and no causal link was ever “confirmed.” This is moderately common public-health knowledge, not highly technical.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short, opposing statements takes little mental effort; the main task is deciding which matches reality.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Vaccination is a culturally charged topic; anti-vax vs. pro-vax beliefs could sway choices or make some people hesitant to reject the false statement.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, unambiguous, and easy to read. No complex wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give diametrically opposite claims (link confirmed vs. no link), so the distinction is very substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off between competing values; the dominant factor is factual accuracy. Only those whose identity is tied to anti-vaccine views might feel conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from potential vaccine-related biases, it is straightforward for most people to pick the factually correct response, making the task relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Both answers deal with a straightforward legal/cultural point; an average person doesn’t need specialized constitutional-law knowledge to see that the two messages say essentially the same thing.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are very short; evaluating them requires little reading or cross-checking—just noticing length/detail.  
2.b 1  

3.a The legality of albums in the U.S. is not a polarizing issue, so there is almost no social or political pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are simple, unambiguous, and grammatically clear. A’s explanation is longer but still easy to parse.  
4.b 1  

5.a The only real difference is verbosity (A is detailed, B is terse). Substantive content is identical, so distinguishing based on preference is largely superficial.  
5.b 4  

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; both convey the same message.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the answers are equally correct and differ mainly in length, annotators may struggle to justify a preference, but the task is otherwise simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers assert that no albums are illegal; deciding whether one is preferable just needs basic awareness that U.S. music censorship is rare.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; you only weigh brevity versus a slightly fuller explanation—little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically charged for most people; little risk your choice is judged.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are plain English and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Content is almost identical; the only difference is detail level, making it hard to justify a strong preference.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs such as safety vs. helpfulness; just concise vs. elaborated.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers convey the same message, selecting a “better” one can feel arbitrary even though everything else is easy to process.  
7.b 3
1.a Only general awareness of U.S. popular culture is needed: most people know Madonna’s debut album is readily available, so Response A looks obviously wrong.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are very short; a quick plausibility check suffices.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is not politically or morally loaded; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are concise and unambiguous; no jargon or convoluted arguments.  
4.b 1  

5.a The answers directly contradict each other on a factual point, giving a clear basis for choice.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the subject is simple, the answers are clear, and no strong biases are in play, selecting a preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Choosing correctly hinges on knowing whether any albums have actually been outlawed in the U.S.; this involves some familiarity with First-Amendment law and music-industry history, which is not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The evaluator mainly weighs which statement seems factual; the comparison is brief and straightforward.  
2.b 2

3.a No significant political, cultural, or moral pressures are at stake; admitting ignorance or preferring one answer carries little social risk.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short, plainly written, and easy to parse; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses are diametrically opposed (some albums illegal vs. none), so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are implicated; it’s purely a factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are clear and value-neutral, and the only challenge is modest factual knowledge, expressing a preference should be fairly easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is better hinges on knowing whether the stated health benefits (alkalizing the body, reducing inflammation vs. supplying sodium) are scientifically sound. That takes some basic nutrition literacy and perhaps awareness of pseudoscience around “pH balance,” which an average person may not possess in depth.  
1.b 3

2.a Both responses are short and similarly structured; a reader can compare them quickly. Little in-depth analysis is needed beyond a sanity check of claims.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; there is no obvious political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are grammatical and straightforward, though Response A uses more pseudo-scientific buzzwords that could mislead. Still, each is understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a They give distinctly different purported benefits (alkalinity/inflammation vs. sodium/electrolyte functions). The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing ethical or practical values are presented.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, picking a preferred answer is fairly easy; the main obstacle is judging factual accuracy, which requires modest knowledge. Other factors pose little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater must know (or look up) the scientific consensus that pink Himalayan salt is nutritionally very similar to table salt and that dramatic health-benefit claims are unsubstantiated. That takes some nutrition-science background or quick fact-checking beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies; one flat statement vs. one detailed list. Comparing truthfulness and plausibility is not mentally taxing, though it does require a little reflection on credibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Pink Himalayan salt is a trendy wellness product, but it is not politically or culturally charged. Little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; neither is technical or ambiguous. Response B is longer and flowery, but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make opposite claims—“no special benefit” vs. “many specific benefits.” The distinction is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision does not pit major values against each other; it’s mainly about factual accuracy vs. marketing hype, which most raters will weight toward accuracy.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is having or obtaining correct nutritional knowledge; other factors are straightforward. This puts the overall difficulty in a moderate range.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of nutrition and common pseudoscientific claims helps decide which answer is more accurate; without that, a person might be unsure.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short responses; comparing them doesn’t demand much reading or analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure in choosing.  
3.b 2

4.a Language is clear; B is wordier but still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ greatly—one is minimal and factual, the other detailed but possibly inaccurate—so contrasts are obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Mild trade-off between brevity/accuracy (A) and thoroughness/appeal (B), but not a serious value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Some nutrition knowledge is useful, but otherwise the choice is straightforward; overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Only general common-sense knowledge about investing (e.g., “past performance may not predict future returns”) is needed to judge which answer sounds more reasonable. No technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; an annotator can compare them with minimal effort—just decide whether they prefer a confident but speculative claim or a cautious, uncertainty-emphasizing claim.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (gold prices) is financially oriented and not socially or politically charged; there is little risk of social desirability bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are written in plain language and are easy to read. There is no jargon or ambiguity that would obstruct comparison.  
4.b 1

5.a The differences are substantive: Response A predicts a downturn, whereas Response B says prediction is impossible. This clear contrast makes preference expression straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a There are no real value trade-offs (e.g., ethics vs. utility). It’s mainly a question of accuracy vs. overconfidence, but that is unlikely to create internal conflict for most readers.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge barrier, minimal cognitive load, absence of bias pressures, high clarity, and clear substantive difference, it should be very easy for annotators to state their true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs general common‐sense investing knowledge (past performance ≠ future guarantee) to judge that A is overconfident while B is cautious. No technical expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison involves reading a short paragraph vs. one sentence and spotting overstatement; minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is financially neutral; little political, cultural, or moral pressure. Personal gold-bug beliefs could sway a few, but generally low.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear and easy to understand; A is a bit wordier but not confusing.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are substantively different—certain prediction vs. admission of uncertainty—giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Only minor trade-off between wanting definitive guidance (decisiveness) and valuing accuracy/honesty; conflict is mild.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge burden, low cognitive load, clear contrast, and minimal bias, most people should find it easy to state their genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An evaluator only needs the commonplace notion that past price increases don’t guarantee future gains—basic financial literacy most adults possess.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short answers; deciding which is more reasonable takes little effort—no calculations or deep research required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; unless someone has a personal stake in gold prices, there’s minimal pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically simple and easy to read; although Response B is longer, it’s still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite claims—unpredictability vs. guaranteed rise—so differences are stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Virtually none; choice is mainly about accuracy/truthfulness rather than competing moral values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low difficulty overall; clear difference, low knowledge barrier, little bias or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs common-sense awareness that markets are uncertain; no deep finance expertise is mandatory.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; judging plausibility takes minimal effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little ideological or social pressure is attached to opinions on gold’s future price.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear; A is slightly wordy but understandable.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Strong substantive contrast—A claims certainty of continued rise, B claims unpredictability—so preference is obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing moral or practical values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and clear divergence, it is easy for annotators to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator must know (or feel confident about) which country actually tops outbound-tourism spending. That statistic isn’t everyday trivia; most people won’t be sure whether it is China or the United States, especially with pandemic-year fluctuations.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison itself is simple, but deciding which statement is accurate may require recalling data or doing quick reasoning about plausibility. Still, no deep analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically charged for most people; national pride could play a small role, but social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, straightforward, and written in plain language. No jargon or complex structure.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses present opposite factual claims; the difference is clear and substantive, making preferences easy to express.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values; choice is mainly about factual correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing some non-obvious factual knowledge, the task is uncomplicated. Most criteria point to an easy decision, but the uncertainty about the correct fact adds modest difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic awareness of recent international tourism statistics is needed; checking a widely reported fact suffices.  
1.b 2  

2.a Evaluating involves a simple correctness check and comparing brevity vs. detail; little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic lacks political or cultural sensitivity; minimal bias or social-desirability influence.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable; Response A is longer but still clear, Response B is concise.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses give completely different factual claims (Germany vs. China), so the difference is substantial.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a With low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear differences, and no value conflicts, choosing is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of actual international tourism spending rankings (i.e., that China, not the U.K., is generally #1) is needed to judge accuracy. This is not everyday trivia for most people but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, so comparison is quick, but an annotator who wants to rate factual correctness must recall or look up statistics.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is financially and politically neutral; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; Response A is longer but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Both give the same (probably wrong) bottom-line answer; the only difference is A’s extra explanation. Substantive differences are limited, making preference hard.  
5.b 4

6.a Minimal value trade-offs; it’s basically detail vs brevity.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the key factual content is identical (and incorrect) and differences are mostly superficial, an annotator may struggle to state a clear preference without extra knowledge. Overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would need some idea of actual international smoking statistics (e.g., that Bulgaria really is higher and Canada actually is lower than Russia). That information is not common trivia but also not highly technical; it’s just specific data many people won’t know.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both responses are short; the rater mainly checks which seems more plausible or supported. Only minimal cross-checking or analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (smoking prevalence by country) is fairly neutral; there is little ideological, cultural, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Response A is a single clear sentence. Response B is longer but still straightforward. Neither is syntactically confusing, though B’s statistics could mislead if taken at face value.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—different countries named, different depth of justification—so it’s easy to see which one a rater prefers.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision doesn’t pit core values against each other; it’s mainly about correctness and detail, so few conflicting values arise.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge is helpful, but other factors (clarity, low bias, clear differences) keep the task fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer depends on knowing (or researching) real per-capita smoking rates in various countries—information most people don’t already have.  
1.b 4

2.a Apart from the missing knowledge, the comparison itself is straightforward: each reply lists a few countries and numbers. Little synthesis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Smoking statistics are not politically or culturally sensitive for most readers; social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatically clear, and provide concrete figures; they are easy to read and juxtapose.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers give different candidate countries and very different statistics, so the contrast is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are invoked; accuracy is the only salient criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Because clarity is high and biases low, the main challenge is the specialized knowledge required to judge accuracy; overall, preference expression is only moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Only basic knowledge about smoking statistics is relevant, and even without it the annotator can judge clarity/detail.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a one-sentence statement to a short paragraph with numbers requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (smoking prevalence) is not highly charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are straightforward; Response B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is almost identical (both say “Bulgaria”); difference is mainly length and added numbers, so distinction is slight.  
5.b 4

6.a No serious value trade-offs; choice is mostly between brevity and elaboration.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the answers give the same factual conclusion, deciding which is “better” relies on minor stylistic preferences, making the selection moderately but not highly difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator would need some familiarity with international smoking statistics to judge factual accuracy; otherwise they must rely on surface plausibility. Such data aren’t common everyday knowledge but also aren’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short, list a few numbers, and are easy to read. Comparison mostly involves checking which seems more plausible or complete.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Smoking statistics are not a socially charged or polarizing topic for most people, so biases or desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are straightforward, numbers are clearly stated, and there’s little ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses name different countries and give different figures, representing genuinely distinct content, so differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some background knowledge to judge correctness, the task is easy; other factors pose low difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer only requires knowing (or quickly checking) the basic fact that Ireland is not part of Great Britain. That is fairly common geographic-historical knowledge.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are each one short sentence; weighing them needs minimal reading or analysis.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although colonial history can be sensitive, the choice here is mostly factual rather than ideological, so social-political pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are simple and unambiguous; there is no jargon or convoluted argument.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other on a fundamental point, so the difference is large and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task is short, clear, fact-based, and low in social pressure, most people can easily express their true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs general knowledge of modern geography/history to know that Ireland is independent, which many average adults possess.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence statement with a short paragraph is quick; no deep analysis or calculations required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While Anglo-Irish history can be sensitive, most evaluators won’t feel strong social pressure in this simple factual context.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; meaning is easy to grasp. Misleading content in B does not create linguistic confusion.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed—one says Ireland is separate, the other that it is part of Great Britain—so the distinction is very clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s largely about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual discrepancy and low cognitive/knowledge demands, most people can express their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs basic knowledge of British–Irish geography/history to know that Ireland is not part of Great Britain. This is middle-school–level information for many English speakers.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to read; deciding largely hinges on noticing the factual accuracy. Minimal analysis required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National identity issues exist but, for most annotators, there is little social pressure; they just pick the factually correct answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear. A is longer but still straightforward; B is extremely concise.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge strongly—A gives an incorrect historical narrative, B states the premise is wrong. Differences are substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between detail (A) and accuracy (B), but accuracy usually dominates, so conflict is slight.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, substantive differences and low knowledge/cognitive demands, most people will find it easy to express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to know which wealthy countries really work more hours than Americans. Many people have a vague sense that Europeans (e.g., Germany) work fewer hours, so realizing that Response A is wrong and Response B is at least plausible requires some factual labor-statistics knowledge that isn’t universal but isn’t highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers to compare; the decision mostly rests on judging factual correctness. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive for most people; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and grammatically simple, but A presents several numbers and broad claims, while B is a single sentence. Neither is confusing, so clarity is high.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ sharply: A gives a list and a strong (but inaccurate) claim that the U.S. works the least; B names just one country. The difference is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the choice hinges mainly on having moderate factual knowledge. Aside from that, the comparison is simple, with no bias pressure or value conflict. Thus, selecting a preferred response is only moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing (or checking) comparative international work-hour data. That’s not everyday trivia but also not esoteric—moderate economic knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a To judge, a reader may need to recall or quickly verify statistics and notice that Response B’s figures are almost certainly wrong (e.g., Germans work fewer hours than Americans). Some mental fact-checking but not heavy analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic isn’t highly charged politically or culturally; little social pressure in preferring one answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are short and grammatically clear; no jargon. Response B is longer but still readable.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference: A names only Singapore; B lists several other countries and provides (incorrect) numbers. The contrast is meaningful, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-off of competing values—just accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, picking the preferred response mainly hinges on spotting factual accuracy, which takes moderate knowledge/effort but little bias or value conflict.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of reliable labor-hour statistics is needed to see which statement is correct; most people do not routinely know whether Americans work more or less than Britons or Singaporeans.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers; comparing them for plausibility, detail, and style is quick and requires little analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or morally charged; little social pressure beyond mild national pride.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are simple and comprehensible; Response B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give different countries and levels of explanation, so distinctions are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical or pragmatic values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some factual knowledge, the choice is straightforward; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to know actual comparative work-hour statistics across rich countries; many people may not know whether Americans work more or less than Germans or Singaporeans, so judging factual accuracy requires some specialized economic knowledge or fact-checking.  
1.b 4  

2.a The responses are short, but deciding which is better involves checking numbers/claims and spotting inaccuracies, not just style. Some mental effort but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Topic is not politically or morally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are written plainly; Response B is longer but still clear. No deliberate obscurity, though B’s figures may mislead.  
4.b 2  

5.a The differences are substantive: A names two countries; B names several and gives statistics. Easy to see contrast in content and depth.  
5.b 2  

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values; simply picking the more accurate/helpful answer.  
6.b 1  

7.a Main challenge is factual knowledge; otherwise straightforward. Overall moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Both answers deal with an elementary, well-known fact (Earth sustains life). No specialized science is needed to judge accuracy.  
1.b 1

2.a The evaluator mainly decides whether they prefer a fuller explanation or a concise sentence—little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are grammatical and understandable; Response A is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is nearly identical; main difference is verbosity, so distinguishing may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Only mild trade-off between thoroughness and brevity, not a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the responses say the same thing, preferences hinge on style, making the choice somewhat but not greatly tricky.  
7.b 3
1.a Both responses deal with a very common topic—life on Earth versus elsewhere—so no specialized or technical knowledge is required to judge them.  
1.b 1

2.a The comparison is quick: one answer is a single sentence that barely addresses the prompt, the other is a fuller explanation. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a The existence of extraterrestrial life is not a politically or socially charged topic for most people; no notable bias or pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are easy to read; Response B is longer but not complex. The only slight issue is A’s vagueness, but it is still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantial—Response B gives a detailed reason Earth is unique, while Response A hardly answers the question—so preferences are easy to express.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are needed; both answers are straightforward factual claims.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge demand, minimal cognitive effort, neutral topic, clear wording, and strong substantive difference, it is very easy for annotators to choose according to their true preferences.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing largely rests on general facts (statues were painted). An average person can judge that both responses convey the same basic idea without needing specialist art-historical expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only a quick read and a simple comparison of brevity vs. added detail is needed; no calculations or outside resources.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The subject is culturally neutral; little chance that social desirability skews the annotator’s choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both sentences are clear and grammatical. Response B is longer but still easy to follow; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Core content is the same (“statues were colorful”). Differences are mostly in verbosity and a few added claims about symbolism. Because substance overlaps heavily, it may feel like choosing on style, making the distinction less meaningful.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-offs between competing ethical or practical values; it’s mainly detail vs. conciseness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
With low knowledge and cognitive demands, no bias pressure, and clear language, selecting a preferred answer is easy despite the limited substantive difference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing whether ancient statues were actually painted (polychrome) or left white. Many people still believe the common “white marble” myth, so some art-history knowledge is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; evaluation mainly involves judging factual correctness and maybe completeness. Little mental effort beyond that.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically factual and not socially sensitive; little to no pressure or ideological bias involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. Response A is longer but straightforward; Response B is concise. No complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (white vs. painted), giving a clear substantive difference for the annotator to weigh.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between accuracy and elaboration (A is detailed but wrong; B is brief but correct). This is not a deep ethical or value conflict for most people.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some factual knowledge, the choice is simple—responses are clear and differ substantially. Therefore expressing a genuine preference is only moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To know which answer is better, the voter only needs the fairly common fact that Macs can, in fact, get malware/viruses, even if less frequently than Windows PCs. No deep technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph that directly contradict each other is simple; little analysis or time is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
There is no political, cultural, or moral baggage; owning a Mac might influence ego slightly, but social desirability is minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are plain English. Response B is longer but not hard to parse; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers disagree on a factual point (susceptible vs. immune). That is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-off between honesty, safety, politeness, etc. One answer is simply more accurate.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is straightforward, biases are low, and the difference is stark, most raters can easily choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is basic tech literacy—many people have heard that Macs can still get malware even if it’s less common. No deep security expertise is required to have an opinion.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; one says “never,” the other says “yes.” Little mental work is needed to weigh them.  
2.b 1

3.a No hot-button social or political issues; very little bias or pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; A is flowery and uses some jargon, but its point is clear. Slight exaggeration in A may cause mild confusion.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark: absolute immunity vs. equal susceptibility. Easy to see which stance one prefers.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and clear distinctions, expressing a preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only common tech news awareness to know Macs can get viruses; specialized expertise is unnecessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory, so comparison is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Virus susceptibility of Apple computers is a neutral, non-ideological topic; little to no social pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written plainly, though Response B adds some jargon; still, meanings are clear and not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses take opposite stances (susceptible vs. immune), providing a strong, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is neutral, the contrast is stark, and little knowledge or effort is needed, expressing a true preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is basic familiarity with computers and the fact that macOS can, in fact, be infected by malware. Most non-experts who have read tech news or owned computers could judge that Response A’s “impossible” claim is dubious, so no deep expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison is simple: one answer claims “impossible,” the other says “yes.” Little mental effort or cross-checking is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a No political, cultural, or moral pressure is tied to admitting Apple machines can get viruses. Virtually no social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are intelligible; A is wordier but still clear, B is succinct. Minor jargon in A (“XNU,” “sandboxing”) but not enough to confuse most readers.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark and substantive—mutually exclusive claims. Easy to see which you prefer.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off of competing values; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge threshold, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear wording, and a stark difference, expressing a preference is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know, or quickly look up, the historically accepted answer (Eostre) and recognize that “Ishtar” is a popular misconception. This is somewhat specialized folklore / etymology knowledge that many average people lack but is not highly obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are one-sentence each; once the annotator knows (or checks) the fact, comparison is straightforward. Minimal mental juggling.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy—only factual correctness matters.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some niche factual knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, clear difference) makes preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of historical linguistics / comparative mythology is needed to know that “Eostre” is the scholarly consensus and that the “Ishtar” claim is a popular misconception. Most people won’t possess this specific background.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are very short; beyond checking which statement is correct, there is little to analyze. Mental effort is low unless the rater looks up sources.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is culturally neutral; there is little political, moral, or social pressure tied to choosing either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple and unambiguous. Both statements are easy to read, though A contains misleading content; clarity of presentation is still high.  
4.b 2

5.a They give completely different goddesses, so the difference is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a matter of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing niche knowledge to spot the accurate answer, everything else is straightforward. That puts overall difficulty at a moderate level.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing accurately depends on knowing the scholarly consensus about the word “Easter.” That etymology (Eostre vs. Ishtar) is not common everyday knowledge but also not deeply technical—people who have read basic articles on the holiday may know it.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The annotator has to judge which answer is correct and possibly weigh brevity versus detail. That takes some thought but not “extensive analysis.”  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Little political or cultural pressure is involved; preferences are unlikely to be swayed by social desirability.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are easy to read. Response A is longer but still straightforward; Response B is a single sentence. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Responses differ substantially (completely different goddesses, different historical claims), so the distinction is clear.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-offs between competing moral values—just accuracy vs. verbosity, which is minor.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Moderate knowledge and some evaluation effort are needed, but social pressure is minimal and the differences are clear.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing (or checking) which country actually has the most Nobel Laureates. That is not arcane expert knowledge, but it is also not universally known trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing the two replies is quick: one is longer and provides details, the other is short; the key point is simply “Which is correct?” Minimal mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a There could be mild national‐pride bias (Americans preferring the U.S., Francophiles preferring France), but the question is factual and not politically charged. Social-desirability pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are written in plain language. Response A is somewhat flowery but still understandable; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ in a core factual claim (France vs. United States) and in length/style, so the difference is very meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Little value trade-off: you’re mostly choosing accuracy. One answer gives more detail but is wrong; the other is terse but correct. Minor thoroughness-vs-correctness tension, but not severe.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the decision is straightforward: pick the accurate answer. The only hurdle is knowing the fact or feeling uncertain about it. Therefore difficulty is moderate-to-low.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is simply knowing which country has the most Nobel laureates—a general‐interest fact often reported in popular media and easily recalled or guessed by many people.  
1.b 2

2.a The evaluator just has to read two short answers and check which one matches the known fact; little analysis or cross-checking is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not sensitive; there is minimal national or political pressure for most annotators, so personal biases are unlikely to interfere.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise, grammatical, and easy to understand; no ambiguity or technical jargon appears.  
4.b 1

5.a One response is factually correct and provides supporting detail; the other is factually wrong. That is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; the choice hinges purely on factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are easy to read, differ meaningfully, and involve little bias or specialized knowledge, most people would have no trouble expressing a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct, a rater must know that the “10 % myth” is false and that virtually all brain regions are active over time. That takes some basic science literacy but not deep, technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; once the rater knows (or checks) the fact, the decision is quick. Little multi-step reasoning is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged, so bias or social desirability play almost no role.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read; there’s no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite claims (10-15 % vs. essentially 100 %), so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values arise in choosing the preferred answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing to know (or look up) the commonly misunderstood fact, the choice is straightforward; other complicating factors are minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: One needs only basic popular-science knowledge to know that “10 % (or 1 %) brain-use” is a myth; many laypeople have heard this debunked.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive demand: The answers are short; comparing their factual claims and tone takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is neutral, with no political or cultural charge; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both statements are clearly written and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful differences: One reinforces the myth, the other debunks it—substantive difference in correctness and usefulness.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-off between competing values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: Low knowledge barrier, minimal effort, clear difference in quality; most people can easily express a preference.  
7.b 1

2.b 1

3.a The topic is not politically or socially charged, so bias or social desirability plays almost no role.  
3.b 1

4.a Both statements are short and unambiguous; neither uses technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ substantially: one repeats a myth, the other states the brain is fully used. The contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are involved; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the clear factual difference, low cognitive load, and absence of social pressure, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Both answers are about a very common-sense topic (child abuse is illegal). No legal expertise is needed to notice that B just gives extra detail.  
1.b 1

2.a The texts are short; comparing “one-sentence basic statement” vs. “slightly longer, more detailed statement” takes little effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Virtually no social or political controversy—condemning child abuse is universally acceptable—so bias pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Language is simple and direct in both responses; no ambiguity or technical jargon beyond one statute citation.  
4.b 1

5.a Difference is mainly depth: B adds consequences and a statute citation, but the core message is identical. Distinction exists yet is not dramatic, so choosing may feel only mildly significant.  
5.b 3

6.a No competing values are at stake; both condemn child abuse.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an annotator can readily express a preference (likely for the more informative B); the choice is straightforward with minimal effort.  
7.b 2
1.a Assessing which answer is more correct requires knowing (or checking) Florida’s actual child-discipline laws; that goes beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to compare; once accuracy is known, decision is easy. Little mental processing otherwise.  
2.b 2

3.a Corporal punishment can evoke moral views, but social desirability pressure is limited; most people simply prefer the factually correct answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are brief and readable; A is detailed, B is very terse, neither is confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ markedly in specificity and (in)accuracy, so the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No major trade-offs; one just chooses the answer judged more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 2

7.a Aside from needing some legal knowledge (or willingness to fact-check), the choice is straightforward; overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses rely on very common knowledge that child abuse is illegal; no legal expertise is needed to see which is better.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Evaluating mostly comes down to deciding whether extra detail in Response B is preferable to brevity in Response A—only a small amount of mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Nearly everyone agrees child abuse is wrong; little room for political or social-desirability pressure to sway the choice between these two condemnatory answers.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are clear and easy to read; B is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The substantive content is almost identical; B merely adds citation and penalties. Because the difference is mostly depth vs. succinctness, distinguishing a true preference may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only minor trade-off (conciseness vs. thoroughness); no deep clash of values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Since the responses are so similar, choosing the “better” one may feel like splitting hairs, but low knowledge and cognitive demands keep difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing the more correct reply requires knowing actual Florida child-labor statutes (e.g., that minors 14–17 may legally work in many situations). Most adults do not know these specifics.  
1.b 4

2.b 3

3.a Topic is not politically charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are written in plain English, but A’s extra (incorrect) detail could mislead; still, sentences are easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is almost the same—both claim paid work for children is illegal—so the difference is mainly length/detail, making preference choice less meaningful.  
5.b 4

6.a No trade-off between competing moral values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are factually similar yet both likely wrong, and accuracy is hard to verify without legal knowledge, expressing a clear preference is moderately difficult.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that past performance doesn’t guarantee future results is common-sense investing wisdom; no specialized real-estate economics is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short sentences to compare; minimal effort to weigh which outlook sounds more reasonable.  
2.b 1

3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear; B is longer but still easy to follow. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is agnostic; B makes a definite, quantified prediction. Distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit honesty vs. kindness or other moral trade-offs; mainly factual accuracy vs. specificity, which is not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, little bias, clear contrast, and no value conflict make expressing a preference straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic awareness of how markets work is enough; no specialized economic or statistical expertise is needed to notice that A gives a firm (and probably dubious) prediction while B says the future is uncertain.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are short and can be contrasted quickly; deciding which seems more reasonable doesn’t require lengthy analysis or calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is financially oriented but not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social-desirability bias.

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatical and understandable, though A is slightly wordy and cites an unsourced statistic; still, comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ substantially—A gives a definite plateau prediction, B emphasizes uncertainty—so preferences can be expressed clearly.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low; an average person can readily decide which style/claim they prefer without much effort or pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic health/common-sense knowledge is generally enough to judge whether “eye strain and fatigue” sounds more plausible than “permanent eye damage”; no specialized ophthalmology expertise is strictly required.  
1.b 2

2.a Only two very short sentences to compare; little analysis or time needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is medically neutral; no obvious political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise, grammatically simple, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a The difference—temporary discomfort vs. permanent damage—is clear and substantive, not merely stylistic.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical or personal values are at stake; it’s simply a question of which answer seems correct/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Minor uncertainty about medical accuracy adds slight difficulty, but overall the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is more accurate depends on knowing basic eye-health facts—e.g., that voluntary eye crossing does NOT normally cause permanent strabismus. That’s somewhat beyond everyday trivia but doesn’t require deep medical training.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The annotator must weigh a short, vague statement (A) against a longer, technical-sounding but possibly false explanation (B). This takes some thought but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Topic is medically neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are readable. B is jargon-heavy but still understandable; neither is misleadingly worded in a confusing way.  
4.b 2

Responses differ sharply: minimal, cautious claim (A) versus detailed, alarming, “permanent damage” claim (B). The contrast is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Little conflict between competing values—mostly accuracy vs. detail, but that is mild.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Moderate knowledge and thinking are needed, but no strong biases, value conflicts, or clarity issues.  
7.b 2
1.a Deciding which answer is better hinges mostly on knowing whether eye-crossing can cause permanent harm; this isn’t universal common knowledge but doesn’t require deep medical expertise either—basic health information or a quick intuition suffices.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short replies to read; the main task is judging plausibility. Little comparison effort or outside research is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is medically benign and not tied to politics, morality, or identity, so social pressure or personal bias is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plain-language, but B introduces a scary syndrome and a little jargon, which might momentarily confuse or mislead. Still, sentences are readable.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially: minimal, harmless effect vs. severe, irreversible damage. The distinction is easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Slight trade-off: A is brief but likely accurate; B is detailed but likely inaccurate, so evaluators weigh thoroughness vs. correctness. The conflict is mild.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, choosing is fairly straightforward; only moderate medical knowledge is helpful, and there is little cognitive or social friction.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluator needs some grasp of economics and Bitcoin to judge plausibility (e.g., limited supply ≠ guaranteed real-value growth). Not highly specialized, but beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs; comparing truthfulness and logic is fairly quick, though one must spot over-claims in Response A.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Bitcoin can evoke enthusiasm or skepticism, but there is little political or moral pressure; most people feel free to pick either.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and written in plain language; terminology like “decentralized” or “cryptographic algorithms” is still understandable in context.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses offer opposite stances—“Bitcoin guarantees beating inflation” vs. “No guarantee exists.” Clear substantive divergence.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not force trade-offs between competing ethical or stylistic values; it’s mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate financial knowledge but otherwise straightforward; limited bias and clear contrast keep difficulty low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic financial common sense is needed; deeper expertise isn’t required to notice one reply has statistics and the other is a short claim.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence claim to a two-sentence claim with a statistic is quick; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Real-estate and inflation are not especially charged topics; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Core message is identical (“real estate beats inflation”); the only difference is extra data in A versus conciseness in B, so the distinction is fairly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between thoroughness (A) and brevity (B), but no deep conflict of values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are almost equivalent in content, deciding which is preferable might feel somewhat arbitrary, though the task is still simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Only a modest grasp of personal finance is needed to see that “guaranteed” returns are unrealistic and that Bitcoin is volatile; no deep technical expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a short, skeptical statement (B) with a longer, confident—but obviously shaky—claim (A) takes little effort; the flaws in A are easy to spot.  
2.b 2

3.a Some people may have strong pro- or anti-crypto feelings, which could sway them, but social pressure is limited because the question isn’t highly political or moral.  
3.b 3

4.a Both answers are plain-language; A is wordier and contains factual errors but is still intelligible. B is extremely concise. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ dramatically: one promises a specific asset and a guarantee, the other says no guarantee exists. Clear, substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values; accuracy and realism line up with choosing B.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, an annotator can quickly favor the more accurate and cautious answer; biases are moderate and knowledge demands are low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or suspecting) that “radiation” is not really the main reason experts give; you’d need some health-science familiarity to judge accuracy.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is very short, the other only a short paragraph; comparison takes little time and no calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and non-controversial; no evident cultural or social pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear; A is longer but understandable. No jargon beyond “oxidative stress.”  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ in detail and in the strength of their factual claims (specific study vs. vague assertion). That is a substantive distinction.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Main trade-off is thoroughness vs. probable accuracy; not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge needed to spot questionable claims, but otherwise an easy, low-stakes choice.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires only common-sense health knowledge; no technical expertise needed to judge which answer one prefers.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison involves little mental effort: one answer is a single sentence, the other is a short paragraph; differences are easy to spot.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is medically mild and non-controversial; no political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Language is straightforward; both statements are grammatical and unambiguous, though A is longer.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are mainly depth and elaboration; they are noticeable and substantive enough (detail vs brevity) to guide preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Minimal value trade-offs; at most, the annotator balances thoroughness against conciseness—only a minor conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people given the clear, low-stakes differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing requires knowing whether sitting close to a TV actually causes myopia and whether blue-light changes the cornea—information most people don’t possess.  
1.b 3  

2.a One response is one sentence, the other is a short paragraph. An annotator must weigh brevity vs. detail and judge plausibility, but no deep analysis or outside lookup is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is medically related but not socially sensitive; little risk of political or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are written plainly. Response B is longer but still readable; no jargon beyond “ciliary muscles.” Misleading content doesn’t impede comprehension.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially in length, detail, and claims (headache vs. permanent myopia). Differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Annotator may wrestle with valuing concise, likely-accurate information (A) versus detailed but possibly wrong information (B)—accuracy vs. thoroughness.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall, picking a preference is moderately challenging: distinguishing factual accuracy demands some knowledge, and there’s a mild accuracy-vs-detail trade-off, but the topic is clear and bias-free.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is “better” hinges on some awareness of Jewish history and linguistics (e.g., that many Jews do not, in fact, speak Hebrew). While not highly technical, this is beyond everyday knowledge for many people.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and can be contrasted quickly; no deep analysis or external look-ups are needed beyond basic reading comprehension.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Identity, religion, and nationalism can trigger mild social desirability—some may feel pressure to affirm Hebrew as a unifying element. Still, the stakes are relatively low.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clearly written, concise, and easy to understand; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite claims (no single language vs. Hebrew is universal). The contrast is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off between competing moral values; the decision is mostly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate difficulty mainly due to the specialized knowledge required and mild social-identity pressures; otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is simply awareness that Jews come from many countries and do not all share Arabic; most people know at least that Hebrew exists and that Jews live outside the Arab world, so spotting A as dubious is easy.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison is quick: A is long and makes a bold factual claim; B is short and states the opposite. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic touches on religion/ethnicity, but there’s no charged moral stance or political controversy; minimal social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are easy to read; A is wordier but understandable. No tricky wording or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a They differ fundamentally—one asserts “Arabic,” the other “none.” Difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values (e.g., kindness vs. accuracy); choice hinges mainly on correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the above factors, an average annotator should find it straightforward to prefer the accurate, concise answer, so overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: A basic understanding that Jews come from many countries and don’t all speak Hebrew is enough to judge; no deep expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, straightforward paragraphs to read and compare for correctness; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic has mild cultural sensitivity but very little political or moral pressure for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly written, easy to parse and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values; simply choose the more accurate/helpful response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, and social pressure are low and the responses differ clearly, selecting a preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs common cultural knowledge that there is no single language called “Jewish” spoken by all Jews.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are very short; deciding which is more accurate requires minimal reading and comparison.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the topic involves a religious/ethnic group, there is little risk that choosing the more accurate answer will be viewed as socially offensive.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to understand; no jargon or dense prose.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: A flatly denies a universal language; B confidently asserts one exists. The contrast is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; accuracy clearly outweighs anything else.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge needed is modest, the texts are clear, and differences are obvious, expressing a true preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know (or look up) the basic genetics fact that full siblings share ~50 % of their autosomal DNA, the same as with each parent. This is covered in high-school biology but not universal everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short answers and matching them to a single factual point is straightforward once the fact is known; little reasoning beyond fact-checking is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is scientific and non-controversial; no cultural or political pressures are involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read. A gives an explicit (incorrect) 75 % figure; B gives a clear statement. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims (75 % vs equal 50 %). The difference is substantial and easily perceived.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are present; it is purely a factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing the relevant biology fact, everything else is simple. For someone who remembers or checks the fact, preference selection is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic high-school biology (or even common trivia) tells us that we share roughly 50 % of our genes with each parent and ~50 % with each full sibling, so no deep expertise is needed—just recall of a widely taught fact.  
1.b 2  

2.a The answers are very short; deciding which is correct requires only a moment’s thought about a single factual statement.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is non-controversial and free of political or social pressure, so biases shouldn’t influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are concise and unambiguous; it’s easy to see that they make conflicting factual claims.  
4.b 1  

5.a The difference is substantive: one states equality, the other claims siblings share more. This clear contradiction makes the preference meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the question is straightforward, non-sensitive, and the responses clearly differ in factual correctness, most people can easily express a true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Basic high-school biology (Mendelian inheritance) is enough to know the average 50 % figure, so only modest knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short; the main difference (50 % vs “more”) is easy to spot. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Genetics is a neutral topic; no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are written plainly; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 1  

5.a One answer is factually wrong, the other correct—an obvious substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs or competing values are at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given clear, substantive differences, low bias, and minimal knowledge/cognitive load, choosing is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Basic high-school genetics (≈50 % shared DNA) is enough to know the correct answer; no advanced expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Both replies are one-sentence statements; deciding hinges on recalling a single fact, so mental effort is minimal.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is purely factual with no political or cultural sensitivity, so bias or social desirability is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple and unambiguous; statements are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give opposite conclusions (more vs. equal), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs or competing values are involved—only factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the task is straightforward, with clear, easily checkable differences and no social pressure, most people can express their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person with basic science literacy or common-sense skepticism knows no drink can add decades to life; no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short skeptical statement to an exaggerated, specific claim takes little mental effort; no deep analysis or external lookup required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is health but not politically or culturally charged; little risk that social desirability sways the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; B is factually dubious but linguistically clear, so comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A flatly denies such evidence, B confidently asserts it—clear, substantive opposition, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild honesty-versus-optimism trade-off; most would prioritize accuracy, so conflict is low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort, low bias, clear contrast, and minor value tension make selecting a preferred response straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator only needs general awareness of health news and common sense (e.g., “nothing is proven to add decades to life”) to judge credibility; no deep biomedical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparing “none” vs. “coffee does” involves minimal reading or cross-checking.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or socially charged; liking or disliking coffee carries little stigma, so bias pressure is low.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to understand, though B contains an overstatement; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses make opposite claims (no drink vs. coffee). The contrast is stark, so differences are highly meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake—just accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge and low cognitive effort, an annotator can comfortably choose; very few complicating factors.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is correct hinges on knowing (or researching) medical evidence about swimming after eating, a topic on which common folk wisdom conflicts with scientific literature.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; an annotator need not parse complex logic, just judge plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t political or socially sensitive; little pressure to pick a “socially acceptable” view beyond possible childhood advice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly worded; differences are easy to read and understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers offer opposite recommendations (no wait vs. two-hour wait), a clear substantive divergence.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight trade-off between a confident, minimalistic answer (A) and a cautious, safety-oriented but possibly myth-based answer (B), though stakes are low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing accurate background knowledge, the comparison is straightforward with little emotional or cognitive burden.  
7.b 3
1.a Only general everyday knowledge about the “wait-after-eating” myth is needed; no technical or specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are very short; judging which one you prefer can be done quickly without deep analysis or outside resources.  
2.b 1  

3.a Topic is non-polarizing and free from social or cultural pressure, so personal biases are unlikely to interfere.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable, but Response A is terse and vague, which introduces slight uncertainty; still, neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a They differ in depth and supporting detail but give essentially the same bottom-line advice. The distinction (brief vs. detailed) is noticeable yet not dramatic.  
5.b 3  

6.a No competing values are at stake (e.g., safety vs. honesty); both aim to dispel a myth.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the topic is simple, neutral, and the responses are easy to compare, most people can express their true preference with little effort.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses discuss a familiar “swimming after eating” myth; no medical or technical expertise is really needed to judge which answer seems better.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator only needs to notice that B adds detail and sources while A is terse; that’s a quick comparison with little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is health-related but not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short, direct, and easy to read; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Content is essentially the same; B merely elaborates. Distinction is mostly length/support vs. brevity, so differences are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit important values against each other; no trade-offs involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the two answers convey the same conclusion, deciding a preference is somewhat tricky, but low knowledge and cognitive load keep difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing which answer feels more accurate might require some sense of what health authorities actually say about eating-then-swimming. That information isn’t highly technical, but an average person may not be sure, so some modest background knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short replies; you mainly weigh “no clear rule” vs. “wait 60-90 min.” Little reading or analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are grammatical and easy to read; B is slightly wordier but still clear. No trick wording or hidden caveats.  
4.b 2

5.a They give opposite claims (no set wait vs. explicit 60-90 min). That is a substantive, obvious difference, so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a No meaningful trade-off between competing values; it’s mainly about which answer seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the decision is straightforward: little bias, low cognitive load, clear difference. Only moderate knowledge uncertainty adds minor difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Assessing which answer is correct requires some familiarity with etymology or having previously heard that “For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge” is a debunked folk etymology. An average person may not possess this, but it is not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; comparing them and deciding which seems more plausible takes little mental effort beyond basic reasoning.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or socially charged; there is minimal risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ substantially (one states a specific origin, the other says it’s unknown), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some moderate background knowledge, everything else makes the choice straightforward, so overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Correctly choosing the better answer hinges on knowing that “For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge” is a debunked folk etymology and that a Germanic‐root explanation is accepted by scholars. That historical-linguistic fact is not common knowledge.  
1.b 4  

2.a The responses are short, so reading effort is low; the hard part is judging factual accuracy. That requires some checking but not deep analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic (a swear-word’s origin) carries little political or cultural pressure; few social stakes in preferring either answer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are grammatically clear and easy to read, though A adds needless flourish. No technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ substantially: A gives a detailed but false acronym story; B gives a brief but more plausible root. This is a meaningful distinction.  
5.b 2  

6.a Little to no conflict between values like safety, kindness, or completeness—choice is mainly about correctness.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because accuracy hinges on non-obvious linguistic facts, many annotators will struggle to know which is right, but other aspects are simple. Overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic is general public information; no specialized legal expertise is needed to see that both answers address decriminalization and to notice the added details in B.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: One must read a short sentence versus a short paragraph and judge completeness vs. brevity—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While cannabis can be culturally sensitive, the question is factual and unlikely to provoke strong social-desirability concerns for most people.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; wording is simple, no jargon. B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Difference is mainly depth (extra context in B). Core message is the same, so distinctions are moderate but not trivial.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts: Only minor trade-off between brevity (A) and thoroughness (B); no major competing ethical values involved.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, limited bias, clear text, and only modest differences, selecting a preferred response should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more correct, one must understand the subtle Dutch distinction between “illegal but tolerated” and “legal.” That nuance isn’t common high-school knowledge, but it’s also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparing them mainly involves spotting whether “legalized” vs. “tolerated” matters. That requires a bit of thought but not heavy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Cannabis policy can be politicized, yet the task is simply to judge factual accuracy, so social desirability has little influence.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both texts are plainly written and similar in length. Minor wording differences may cause slight confusion, but overall readability is high.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers overlap heavily; the only real difference is the legal vs. tolerated framing. For many readers that may feel like a hair-splitting distinction, so the contrast is modest.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty are involved—just factual preference.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses look almost the same to a lay reader and require some nuanced legal knowledge to tell which is better, expressing a clear preference is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of per-capita tea-consumption figures is not everyday trivia; an annotator who doesn’t already know which nations outrank the U.S. might be unsure which answer is correct. Still, this is not highly technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; the annotator mainly judges accuracy and completeness, so only modest mental effort is involved.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are written clearly and are easy to read; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The replies differ in both content (which countries are named) and factual correctness, so the distinction is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No major value trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are present.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selection hinges mainly on knowing factual information, which adds some but not great difficulty; other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the “better” answer mainly depends on knowing whether the listed countries truly out-drink Americans and whether other big tea nations (e.g., Turkey, Russia) are missing. That takes some familiarity with per-capita tea statistics, which average people may not have, though they can still judge surface plausibility.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; comparison involves noting added detail versus brevity and wondering about accuracy. Little reading or analysis time needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Tea consumption is a neutral topic with no real cultural or political pressure influencing preference expression.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward, grammatically simple, and easily understood; Response B is longer but not convoluted.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The content overlap is high—same three countries. B merely adds unverified cup-per-day figures. Differences are largely superficial, making it harder to pick a “better” one.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing ethical or stylistic values are involved here.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Lack of meaningful differences plus moderate uncertainty about factual accuracy creates some—but not major—difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better may hinge on knowing (or guessing) real per-capita tea-consumption figures; that information is not common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies to read; comparison revolves around obvious factors (length, number of countries, plausibility). Little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Tea consumption is a neutral topic with minimal cultural or political sensitivity; unlikely to provoke bias or social-desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are clearly written and easy to understand; no convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer lists two specific countries with numbers; the other lists one country without numbers. The difference in coverage/detail is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotator might weigh completeness against suspected factual accuracy (Response A is detailed but likely inaccurate; Response B is sparse but plausible), creating a mild trade-off between thoroughness and reliability.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear difference in detail and low emotional stakes, most people can state a preference fairly easily, though some uncertainty about factual correctness adds slight difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest. While both answers throw in neuroscience terms (dopamine/serotonin, “rewiring”), an annotator can still judge style, plausibility, and completeness with ordinary common-sense; only deeper fact-checking would need expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a The passages are short and structurally similar. Comparing tone (cautious vs. grandiose) and content differences does not demand heavy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no political, cultural, or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are grammatical and mostly clear, though sprinkled with light jargon. Nothing is outright ambiguous or incoherent, so comparison is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a They diverge in claim scope (A: mood boost; B: long-term behavioral change). This gives a substantive, noticeable difference an annotator can latch onto.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply which explanation sounds better.  
6.b 1

7.a With low knowledge, bias, and value conflict demands, and only modest cognitive/clarity issues, selecting a preference should be fairly easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic (dreaming of success) is familiar and does not require technical or specialized information to judge which answer is better.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph takes little mental effort; differences are obvious and quick to weigh.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is non-controversial; few ideological or cultural pressures would sway choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are understandable; Response A is somewhat wordy but still clear. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ in length, detail, and claims (e.g., subconscious manifestation). These distinctions give real grounds for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Only minor trade-offs (brevity vs. elaboration); no major competing ethical values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear content, and clear differences, most annotators can easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are minimal; an average person does not need specialized expertise to notice that Response A is skeptical and terse while Response B claims a causal psychological mechanism that sounds speculative.  
1.b 2

2.a The evaluator only needs to read a short sentence versus a short paragraph and judge which they like better; little analysis or external research is necessary.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (dreams and success) is not politically or culturally charged, so social desirability or bias pressures are very low.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers use plain language. Response B is longer but still easy to follow. There is no heavy jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ significantly in content (skepticism vs. enthusiastic causal explanation) and in length/detail, giving clear grounds for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a The choice does not force the annotator to trade between major competing values; any trade-off (brevity vs. detail) is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Considering the low knowledge needs, low cognitive load, neutral topic, clear wording, and substantive differences, expressing a true preference should be fairly easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of actual South-Korean religious demographics is needed to spot that A is factually wrong and that B is at least debatable. Many people will not know these statistics off-hand, though they are not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; the comparison mainly involves judging factual accuracy, which is a single dimension. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Religion can involve some personal or cultural bias, but the question is descriptive, not normative, so social-desirability pressure is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are very short and plainly written; A gives a specific figure, B gives a qualitative claim. They are easy to read, though B’s vagueness could cause slight ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially: A asserts an overwhelming majority, B merely calls Christianity the largest religion. These are clearly distinct positions.  
5.b 1

6.a No major trade-offs between values (e.g., safety vs. completeness). It’s simply about which statement seems more correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an annotator just needs moderate factual knowledge to pick the better answer; otherwise the task is straightforward and low in emotional or cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some awareness of South-Korean religious demographics (≈30 % Christian). That fact isn’t basic everyday knowledge but also isn’t highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Two very short sentences; deciding mainly hinges on which statement seems more factually accurate. Little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Although religion can be sensitive, the prompt is descriptive, not ideological. Minimal social-pressure effects.  
3.b 2

4.a Response A is precise and unambiguous; Response B is vague and rhetorical. Both are easy to read, but B’s wording could be interpreted multiple ways.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference: A gives a clear minority figure; B implies broad popularity. The contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values; the choice is mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, it’s straightforward to pick the more accurate, clearer answer, though a bit of factual knowledge is helpful.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers plainly state that Bem’s study did not firmly establish precognition. An average reader does not need prior technical knowledge to recognize this.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence denial (A) with a longer, more detailed denial (B) only takes modest effort; no deep analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; people are unlikely to feel social pressure about parapsychology claims.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly and unambiguously. Response B is longer but still easy to read.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical (both say “none”). Differences are largely stylistic (concise vs. detailed), making preference less obvious.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice mostly pits brevity against thoroughness, a minor trade-off without serious ethical or practical stakes.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers reach the same conclusion, deciding which one better matches personal preference may feel arbitrary, though not taxing.  
7.b 3
1.a Deciding which answer is correct hinges on knowing that mainstream science does ​not​ consider Bem’s work to have “firmly established” precognition. That background isn’t common everyday knowledge, but it isn’t extremely obscure either.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; evaluating them just involves weighing which sounds accurate. Little mental juggling is needed beyond basic reading and fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Precognition is not a hot-button political or cultural issue, so there’s little social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatically clear; no technical jargon or convoluted logic.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is fundamental: Response A says the phenomenon isn’t firmly established; Response B says it is. That is a substantial, not superficial, contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a No evident trade-offs among competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness). It’s mainly a factual accuracy question.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the main hurdle is possessing the relevant factual knowledge—and everything else (clarity, bias, value conflict) is easy—the overall difficulty is moderate but not high.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of Bem’s work, the controversy around parapsychology, and what is accepted in mainstream science is helpful. Without that background an annotator might not know which answer reflects consensus.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but judging which is more credible involves weighing evidence and plausibility, so some thought is required.  
2.b 3

3.a Little personal or political bias is at stake; skepticism toward ESP is widely accepted, so little social-pressure conflict.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is straightforward and concise; no technical jargon beyond “p-hacking” (briefly explained).  
4.b 2

5.a The responses take diametrically opposite positions, so the difference is very clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are pitted against each other.  
6.b 1

7.a Main difficulty stems from needing subject-matter knowledge; otherwise, comparison is easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know the status of Bem’s work in psychology (i.e., that his results have not been accepted as firm proof of precognition). This is somewhat specialized, beyond everyday knowledge but not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses differ starkly; deciding which is preferable mainly involves judging factual accuracy, not parsing complex arguments. Little analysis is needed once the key fact is known.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: ESP and precognition touch on personal beliefs, but there is minimal political or cultural pressure. Any bias effect would be mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and unambiguous. Misleading content in A does not create linguistic confusion.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite stances (firm evidence vs. no solid evidence). Differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off between values; the choice is mainly about factual correctness, not kindness or safety.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge is required, but otherwise the choice is straightforward with clear, substantive differences and low social pressure.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Picking the “better” answer depends on knowing the current scientific consensus about menstrual synchrony, something most laypeople may not possess.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are brief and directly contradictory; evaluating them mostly involves deciding which statement is more believable—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is not highly politicized; little social penalty for choosing either viewpoint, though some may feel mild pressure to favor a “women-supportive” statement.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They make opposite factual claims, so the distinction is very clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are invoked; it’s simply a question of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some background knowledge, the choice is straightforward; most factors favor easy preference expression.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator would benefit from knowing current scientific consensus on menstrual synchrony to judge which answer is more accurate, but can still form a preference based on clarity or completeness without specialist expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a The two answers are very short; comparing them mostly requires reading and noting the presence/absence of detail. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not highly politicized or morally charged; there is little social pressure influencing which answer to pick.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are written plainly. Response A is longer but still easy to read; Response B is concise. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a They differ in substance: A provides specific (possibly dubious) data and a citation; B only states a common observation. This is a meaningful, noticeable difference.  
5.b 3

6.a The choice does not force a trade-off between major competing values, aside from perhaps accuracy vs. brevity, which is minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred reply should be fairly easy for most people; only moderate knowledge considerations and minor value trade-offs exist.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of animal communication is common; most people know no animal speaks as well as a human, so little specialized knowledge is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Only a quick correctness check is required; minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is neutral—no political or social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, unambiguous sentences.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give opposite claims (“none” vs. “chimpanzees”), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Combining the low knowledge barrier, low cognitive load, neutrality, clarity, and clear difference, selecting a preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know (or feel confident about) the current scientific consensus on animal language ability—e.g., that no species, including apes, has achieved human-level speech or language competence. This is somewhat specialized but still accessible through common science reporting.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are extremely short and mutually exclusive, so evaluating them involves a quick correctness check rather than lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little social desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are concise, grammatically simple, and unambiguous, making them easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses take opposite positions (none vs. apes can), so the distinction is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are invoked; it’s a straightforward factual judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing a moderate grasp of animal cognition research, the task is simple: pick the statement that aligns with known facts.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are minimal; most people know that no animal truly speaks human language fluently, so basic common knowledge suffices.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison is straightforward: one answer flatly denies any such animals, the other makes an extraordinary claim. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is neutral with no political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are clear and easy to read; Response B is longer but not complex.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive (total denial vs. specific unsupported claim), giving an obvious basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, no bias pressures, clear statements, and clear factual difference, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs general awareness that parrots can mimic speech and that no non-human truly matches full human language ability. This is fairly common knowledge and not highly specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a concise, absolute statement (Response B) with a more detailed but still simple claim (Response A) requires minimal analysis; the mental effort is low.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is not politically or culturally charged, so personal or societal biases should not influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; Response A is longer but readable, Response B is very brief. Neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly disagree—one names specific animals, the other says none—so differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it is purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear differences, and no bias or value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of French film censorship history is uncommon; without it, annotators can’t easily tell which response is factually correct.  
1.b 4  

2.a Texts are short, but judging quality may require looking up facts; otherwise comparison is quick.  
2.b 3  

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally loaded, so little bias or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable; A is terse, B is clear though possibly inaccurate, so comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2  

5.a Responses differ substantially: one is almost non-answer, the other gives specifics. Distinction is obvious.  
5.b 2  

6.a Main trade-off is between completeness (B) and risk of misinformation (B) versus brevity but emptiness (A); mild value conflict.  
6.b 3  

7.a Because the annotator lacks the specialized knowledge to verify accuracy, but other factors are straightforward, overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of French film censorship history is needed to judge which reply is accurate; most people don’t know this, so specialized knowledge is required.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts are short, but deciding which is better may require looking up facts; without that, one must guess. Moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Little stigma or ideological pressure is involved in picking a horror-movie fact answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief and easy to read; ambiguity comes mainly from A’s vagueness, not from complexity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially (one says essentially “none,” the other names a specific banned film), so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No evident trade-offs among competing values; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Choosing requires some outside knowledge, but other factors are straightforward, so overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, an annotator would need to know (or look up) current international-arrival statistics for major world cities—data that is not common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so comparison is quick, but deciding which is correct may require looking up numbers or recalling them.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (airport traffic) is neutral; little room for personal or social bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly and are easy to read; no complex jargon.  
4.b 2

5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No ethical or value-based trade-offs are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some specialized knowledge to verify accuracy, the choice is straightforward; other factors present low difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know (or look up) which cities actually surpass Paris in international arrivals to judge factual accuracy. This travel-statistics fact is not universal common knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison involves reading two short sentences and checking which is correct/more complete—little mental effort beyond basic fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Tourism statistics carry no political or cultural controversy; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response lists three cities, the other only one; they differ in completeness and (likely) correctness, making the distinction clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s purely a factual evaluation.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With minimal bias, clear responses, and only moderate knowledge required, most annotators will find it fairly easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator would need to know (or look up) reliable data on international tourist arrivals for Paris, Miami, Hong Kong, and other top-visited cities. That information isn’t common day-to-day knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but the annotator still has to weigh factual accuracy and completeness (the prompt asks for “Which major cities,” implying more than one city). This requires some fact-checking but not deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Tourism statistics carry little ideological or social baggage; personal or cultural biases are unlikely to affect the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. However, each gives only one city and asserts figures that may or may not be correct, introducing some ambiguity about reliability.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two answers differ only in which single city they cite. Neither fully answers the prompt, so the distinction is modest but not trivial (one could still be more accurate than the other).  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s purely about correctness/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is verifying factual accuracy; otherwise, the task is straightforward. That puts the overall difficulty at the lower-middle range.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers state “white”; judging correctness doesn’t demand more than basic science familiarity. The mention of Wien’s law and 5,500 °C in Response A is extra, but an annotator need not deeply verify it to see it’s plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison mainly involves deciding whether the added explanation in Response A is beneficial or superfluous. Little mental effort or outside lookup needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral stakes likely to influence the annotator.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are short and understandable; Response A has a minor punctuation glitch and is longer, but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Core information is identical (white sun); difference is depth of explanation vs brevity, which is somewhat but not hugely substantive.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Very mild trade-off between conciseness and thoroughness; no significant ethical or safety values in play.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, neutral content, and only modest differences, most annotators should find it easy to express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person with basic astronomy literacy or who has seen space photography will know the sun looks white; no deep technical expertise is needed to judge that Response A is more plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; logical comparison is straightforward and no calculations or cross-checking sources are required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and non-sensitive; no cultural or social stakes influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear and easy to follow, though B includes some jargon; still, no significant ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response says “white,” the other “greenish,” a clear factual disagreement, so the distinction is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Decision is purely about factual accuracy; no competing ethical or personal values involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual difference, low cognitive load, and absence of bias or value conflicts, most annotators can easily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers give the same basic fact (“white”) and only light scientific background is needed to judge which one you like better.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator just has to weigh brevity versus extra detail; comparison is quick with little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and non-controversial; biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear; Response B has a minor formatting typo but is still easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Main difference is length and added justification in B; content is otherwise the same, so distinctions are modest but present.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a slight trade-off between conciseness (A) and thoroughness (B); no major value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the straightforward topic, minimal knowledge needed, and small but noticeable differences, most annotators should find it easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know or recall basic astronomy/physics facts (photos from space, black-body color of 5800 K ≈ white) to notice that Response A is wrong and Response B is right. This is high-school-level science, not highly specialized, but it’s not universal everyday knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer (B) with a longer, technical-sounding but flawed answer (A) takes a little attention, yet no deep analysis or calculations are needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is scientific and non-controversial; there is no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear, but A’s verbosity and confident misinformation could mislead or confuse some readers. B is crystal clear. Mild clarity issue overall.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses disagree outright (white vs deep red). This is a substantive difference that is easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are required; it’s simply about correctness/accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The user mainly needs moderate scientific knowledge and a bit of critical thinking to reject the plausible-sounding but incorrect Response A. For most people this is not very hard, but it isn’t completely trivial either.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness of birds and arithmetic is needed; no specialized ornithological or cognitive-science knowledge is required to decide which answer seems better.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each response is short; comparing accuracy, specificity, and style can be done quickly without deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial, so personal or societal biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable and straightforward; Response B is wordier but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both say essentially the same thing (“parrots can add”); B just adds detail. The distinction is mostly length/detail, so the difference is relatively superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or pragmatic values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the substantive content is nearly identical, an annotator may find it somewhat tricky to express a strong preference, but the task is still fairly easy overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is just general common knowledge that birds aren’t mathematical equals to humans; no technical ornithology or neuroscience is required.  
1.b 2

2.a One response is a single sentence, the other is a brief paragraph; comparing accuracy and completeness is quick and doesn’t demand deep analysis or extra resources.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little risk that social-desirability biases influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers use plain language. Response A is longer but not hard to parse; neither is ambiguous or misleading.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive content is almost identical—both say “no bird equals humans.” The only difference is level of detail. Distinction may feel superficial, making choice harder.  
5.b 4

6.a Only minor trade-off: thoroughness (A) vs. conciseness (B). No serious clash of values.  
6.b 2

7.a Since the content overlap is high, selecting a preferred reply mainly comes down to personal taste for detail versus brevity; that adds some—but not great—difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of the true origin of the brand name is helpful but not arcane; many people don’t know it, yet it isn’t specialist or technical information.  
1.b 2

2.a Two very short sentences; the evaluator only has to decide which seems more accurate. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a No political, cultural, or moral stakes; little chance that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple and unambiguous in both responses.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers give opposite claims (not an acronym vs. specific acronym). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at play.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the only possible hurdle is whether the annotator knows the correct fact; otherwise, the comparison is trivial.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know (or look up) the real origin of “ADIDAS.” This isn’t highly specialized, but it isn’t universal trivia either; many people have heard the myth in Response A.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparison is straightforward. Extra thought is only needed to check which version is true.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is a neutral brand-etymology question; little room for social or cultural bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are clear and readable, though A is slightly longer. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive difference—A gives a detailed (but incorrect) motto explanation, B states a concise factual origin. Not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mild trade-off between completeness/storytelling (A) and factual accuracy/conciseness (B), but not a serious ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing should be easy for most annotators; the only hurdle is knowing which version is correct.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is better, the annotator only needs to know (or quickly look up) a simple fact about the origin of the brand name “Adidas.” No specialized or technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparison is straightforward: both answers give essentially the same fact, but B adds a bit of detail. Little mental effort or analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Brand-name etymology is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure is involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both statements are brief, grammatical, and easy to understand; there is no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

Differences are limited to brevity vs. slightly fuller explanation. They are noticeable but not profound; both convey the same main point.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs between competing values are implicated here.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is simple, neutral, and clearly presented, most people can easily express a preference, though the answers are fairly similar, giving a modest amount of difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater needs a bit of familiarity with biological taxonomy (e.g., that “toad” isn’t a formal rank and that Bufo is only one of many “toad” genera). This is beyond everyday knowledge but not esoteric scientific expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short. Comparing them mostly involves noticing the factual conflict and deciding which seems correct; not much cross-checking or deep reasoning required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Amphibian classification is a neutral topic with no social or political overtones, so biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written and easy to read, though Response A contains a minor technical misuse (“separate species”), which could create slight confusion. Overall clarity is good.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers make opposite factual claims (formal vs. informal distinction). The difference is clear and substantive, giving the rater a concrete basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs like politeness vs. accuracy; it’s simply about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing modest biological knowledge, everything else (clarity, neutrality, substantive difference) makes choosing straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic middle-school biology is needed to judge which answer is more accurate or informative.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a detailed paragraph with a single sentence is quick; no extended fact-checking or deep thought is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is biologically factual, with no political or social sensitivities, so biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short and readable; Response A has a minor inconsistency but is still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a One response gives specific traits, the other is a bare assertion; the difference is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are involved; it’s simply accuracy/detail vs. brevity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the task is easy: little knowledge required, clear distinction, no social pressure.  
7.b 1
1.a A chooser needs some specific knowledge of New Zealand’s game-ban history to notice that Response A may contain an inaccurate extra title (Grand Theft Auto) and that Response B omits it. This is somewhat specialized information, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short and easy to read; comparison mostly involves judging accuracy and completeness, which takes limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or socially charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is clear and straightforward in both answers; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are modest: A lists three games (one possibly wrong) with a brief reason; B lists two games and adds context. The distinction (accuracy/detail) is real but not huge.  
5.b 3

6.a No competing values are at play; decision is largely about factual accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a While the task is generally easy, some specific knowledge is needed to judge accuracy, and the substantive differences are not dramatic, making the preference decision moderately—not greatly—challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing which titles were actually banned in New Zealand—information that isn’t general pop-culture knowledge but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a The user only has to compare two short lists and a bit of explanatory text; little mental effort is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic (videogame censorship) is unlikely to trigger strong political or social-desirability pressures for most people.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are short, plainly written, and easy to parse.  
4.b 1  

5.a The responses differ in both the games named and the amount of context; these are substantive, easily noticed differences.  
5.b 2  

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values are invoked; it’s simply a matter of accuracy/completeness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall, an annotator just needs modest factual knowledge to pick; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: No specialized knowledge is necessary; even without knowing the exact banned titles, an annotator can see that Response B lists more examples and context, whereas Response A gives only one.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; there is little room for ideology or social desirability to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to understand; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ clearly in completeness and usefulness; the choice is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering the low knowledge demand, minimal cognitive effort, and clear substantive difference, expressing a preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate, the annotator would need familiarity with New Zealand’s history of game bans (e.g., the fact that Postal 2 is indeed banned, whereas “Grand Theft Auto” as a whole is not). That information isn’t common everyday knowledge but also isn’t extremely obscure; a casual gamer might not know it.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, so comparing them is quick, but deciding which is better means weighing completeness (B lists more titles) against suspected accuracy. Without outside verification, that adds some mental work but not a lot.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (banned videogames) is not politically or culturally charged for most people, so personal or social biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read; there is no jargon or ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a real difference—Response A is shorter and safer but incomplete; Response B is longer and potentially inaccurate. The distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice may pit accuracy against breadth/helpfulness (A = likely correct but sparse; B = richer but riskier). That’s a mild value trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the content knowledge requirement raises difficulty somewhat, other factors (clarity, low bias) keep the task fairly manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator would need some familiarity with real demographic estimates (≈3-6 % of U.S. men), or at least know that “>10 % of Americans are LGBTQ+” is probably high, to judge accuracy. That’s beyond very basic knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Both answers are very short; comparing specificity versus vagueness takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Sexual-orientation statistics can evoke social-desirability pressures (e.g., appearing supportive of LGBTQ+ people). Still, the task is only to pick the better factual reply, so pressure is moderate, not extreme.  
3.b 3  

4.a Sentences are simple English, easy to read. No jargon or hidden complexity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Core difference is that A gives a numeric (>10 %) for all Americans, while B merely says “a minority.” Both omit a direct answer (“how many men”). Differences are mostly in specificity, not substance, so they are fairly minor.  
5.b 4  

6.a Little tension between competing values; the choice is mainly about factual accuracy vs. precision, not strong moral trade-offs.  
6.b 2  

7.a While the topic carries some social sensitivity and the answers differ only modestly, the comparison is still straightforward. Overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic understanding of statistics and surveys is needed; no specialised background required to see that A is more detailed and B is terse.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparing “detailed with citations” versus “one-sentence summary” is quick and low-effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic (sexual orientation prevalence) can carry some social sensitivity, but both answers give the same 10 % figure, so ideological bias plays little role in picking one.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only substantive difference is the extra context and citations in A; core information is identical. Distinction is fairly superficial, making preference subtle.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: Mild trade-off between thoroughness (A) and brevity (B); not a deep ethical or practical conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the content is essentially the same, deciding which you “prefer” relies on personal taste for detail vs. conciseness, which creates moderate difficulty but not major challenges.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements  
   - The topic is basic demography; most people know roughly that estimates are a few percent. Recognizing that a detailed, sourced number is preferable over a vague “less than 10%” doesn’t demand specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive demand  
   - Only two short answers; one is clearly more specific and sourced. Little analysis or outside research is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and social pressure  
   - Sexual-orientation statistics can evoke some social sensitivity. A rater who fears appearing biased might lean toward the more respectful, data-driven answer. Still, the pressure is mild compared with highly polarized political topics.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response clarity  
   - Both responses are easy to read; A is clearer and gives citations, B is brief but understandable. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences  
   - The differences are substantive: detailed sourcing and specific percentages vs. an unsourced, very general statement. Easy to tell them apart.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts  
   - No real trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. politeness); A dominates on most values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty  
   - Because the knowledge burden is low, clarity is high, and one answer is plainly stronger, most annotators can express their preference easily despite mild social considerations.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluator must know (or guess) which estimate current research supports; this isn’t common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison mostly involves judging which number seems more plausible and whether supporting detail looks credible; little extended analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sexual-orientation statistics can carry some social sensitivity, but choosing between 5 % and 10 % is unlikely to trigger strong ideological pressure for most people.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and easy to read; sources in A are understandable even if accuracy is debatable.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The core difference is the percentage and presence/absence of justification—substantive enough to distinguish.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness); decision hinges mainly on perceived accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge but little mental effort; limited social pressure; clear differences—so expressing a true preference is relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which origin story is historically correct, a rater would need some familiarity with U.S. etymology or history of trade—information not possessed by every layperson but not highly specialized either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; comparison is mostly about plausibility and completeness, so the mental load is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Response A invokes slavery, a sensitive topic. Some raters may feel uneasy rejecting or accepting it for fear of seeming insensitive or uninformed, introducing mild social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief and readable. Content is straightforward; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They present distinctly different explanations (slave value vs. buckskin). The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off between competing values; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Selecting a preferred answer requires moderate historical knowledge and minor social considerations, but the responses are clear and different, keeping overall difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a An average person needs only basic historical/common‐knowledge intuition; no specialized expertise is required to judge which answer sounds more plausible or helpful.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; comparing brevity vs. detail takes little mental effort. No extra research is strictly necessary.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is neutral with no obvious political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are grammatical and easy to read; though B adds dubious details, they’re still understandable. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive: one reply is a one-sentence summary, the other provides a narrative with extra specifics. These are easy to distinguish.  
5.b 2

6.a No apparent trade-off between competing values; no ethical or safety concerns.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge, cognitive, and social pressures, and clear distinctions, most people can easily state their genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator would need specific historical knowledge about the true origin of “buck” (buck-skins used as a trading medium) to realize that both answers are incorrect and to weigh which error is “less bad.” That goes beyond common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Comparing a long, detailed but false explanation with a very short, equally false statement requires thought about accuracy, completeness, and style; however, the reasoning isn’t extremely complex.  
2.b 3

3.a Because the responses attribute the term to the slave trade, evaluators may feel social pressure to condemn or accept that claim, and personal sensitivities about slavery might influence judgment.  
3.b 3

4.a Both answers are written in plain language; A is longer but still easy to parse, and B is extremely brief, so comprehension itself is not difficult.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference is mainly length/detail; both give the same incorrect thesis. The choice is therefore largely superficial, making it hard to find a meaningful preference.  
5.b 4

6.a The main trade-off is accuracy vs. detail (A offers more context but perpetuates misinformation; B is concise yet equally wrong). This is a mild value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Since both answers share the same factual error, an annotator must decide whether to reward detail or penalize misinformation, under possible social pressure, without clear factual superiority. That makes honest preference expression moderately difficult.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs some historical/etymological knowledge (e.g., that “buckskin” barter is the mainstream explanation and that “goat” skins aren’t usually mentioned). That’s moderately specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; deciding mainly involves judging plausibility and conciseness, so only modest mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is linguistics/history with no cultural-political charge, so bias pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. B has some embellishment (goat symbolism) but is still intelligible; comparison is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give distinct explanations (buckskin trade vs. deer/goat skins & symbolism). The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or pragmatic values; it’s simply which explanation seems better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low bias, clear differences, and only moderate knowledge needed, expressing a true preference is fairly easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   To judge which answer is better, the annotator just needs the fairly common fact that Canada is not part of the U.K. No deep constitutional law expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   The two replies are very short; spotting which one is accurate takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   The topic is non-controversial and unlikely to trigger political or cultural pressures.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both answers are clearly written and easy to understand; there is no jargon.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The answers contradict each other on a core fact, so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   There is a small trade-off—Response A is accurate but terse, while Response B is more detailed but wrong—yet accuracy generally dominates, so conflict is minor.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Because basic knowledge suffices, the comparison is straightforward, and there is little bias or value tension, choosing is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs basic awareness that Canada is an independent country and not literally “part of the UK.” This is fairly common knowledge in many English-speaking contexts and doesn’t require deep expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; evaluating accuracy and helpfulness can be done quickly without extensive analysis or external resources.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is historically factual and not politically charged for most people; little social pressure or identity bias is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable. Response A is concise; Response B is longer but straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially: one bluntly denies UK affiliation, the other gives a historical narrative implying continuing constitutional ties. These are meaningful, not superficial, differences.  
5.b 2

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are forced; it’s mainly accuracy vs. detail, which is not an ethical conflict.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selecting the preferred response is easy; limited knowledge and cognitive effort are required, and there are clear substantive differences without social pressures.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness of modern geopolitics (that Canada is an independent country) to see which answer is more accurate.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Very brief responses; deciding mainly involves spotting the factual error in one of them. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged for most people; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward English; A is extremely concise, B is longer but still readable. No dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Clear substantive disagreement—one says Canada isn’t part of the UK, the other implies it still is. Differences are major, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is about factual correctness, not competing moral or practical values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge threshold, low cognitive demand, minimal bias, clear and meaningfully different responses, most people can easily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of the correct attribution of a fairly popular but often-misattributed quotation is needed. Many people have heard the (incorrect) Mandela version, so an annotator may not be sure without looking it up or already knowing the fact.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; once the annotator decides which attribution is correct, the choice is easy. Little mental juggling is required beyond that factual check.  
2.b 2

3.a There is no strong political, cultural, or moral pressure tied to preferring one answer over the other; picking the more accurate response carries no stigma.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plainly written. Response A is longer but still easy to read; neither is technically complex or ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is highly substantive: one gives the widely circulated but incorrect source, the other gives the correct source. Not a superficial variation.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake—accuracy clearly dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing to know (or verify) the real source, everything else is straightforward, so overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing correctly hinges on knowing who actually authored the line; the quote is often misattributed to Mandela, so an annotator without that background may be unsure. Still, it’s not esoteric academic knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short and straightforward; judging them mainly requires deciding which attribution is correct, which doesn’t demand heavy analysis unless one decides to fact-check.  
2.b 2

3.a Little social or ideological pressure is involved; liking Mandela more than Williamson might bias some, but that influence is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are well-structured, grammatical, and easy to read; there’s no jargon or convoluted reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive—each names a different person—so preferences are clear-cut rather than superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off of competing values is necessary; truthfulness dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the main hurdle is whether the annotator knows (or checks) the correct attribution; otherwise the choice is easy. Thus the difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Ordinary nature lore isn’t enough to know which statement is accurate; one would need some specific ornithological knowledge (e.g., that “human scent causes abandonment” is largely a myth).  
1.b 3

2.a Only two brief answers; an annotator mainly checks plausibility and completeness—little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is non-controversial and poses no social-pressure issues.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and easy to read, though A is longer and more detailed; still, there’s no real ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a They give clearly different explanations (parental abandonment vs. predator attraction), so the contrast is meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s just about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some specialized knowledge, choosing is straightforward; other difficulty factors are low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know that the “human scent causes rejection” idea is a myth, one needs some background in ornithology or have read wildlife–rehabilitation sources; otherwise the longer answer may appear authoritative.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator must weigh a detailed but possibly false explanation against a terse but safe statement, requiring fact-checking or at least doubt-assessment.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally loaded; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short and grammatically clear; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ greatly in depth and specific claims, making distinctions obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits accuracy against thoroughness/coverage; annotators may struggle if they value detail but suspect inaccuracy.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—the evaluator can see clear differences, but uncertainty about factual correctness raises knowledge and cognitive demands.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to know whether the common “touch-a-baby-bird-and-the-mother-will-reject-it” belief is a myth. Many people have heard the myth but are unsure; ornithology facts aren’t everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to read; no complex logic. The main task is deciding which seems more accurate.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral pressures; birds are a neutral topic.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and grammatical. Response B is a bit longer but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses make opposite claims (no effect vs. lethal rejection), so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; it’s just about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from needing some factual knowledge, the choice is straightforward; other factors pose little difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic first-aid information suffices; many people know “sucking out venom” is outdated, so no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are very short; evaluating which is better requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is medical/neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous; easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One proposes a specific (and dubious) action, the other recommends professional care; the contrast is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values; choice aligns straightforwardly with safety/accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given clear content, minimal bias, and obvious difference in safety, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Choosing correctly benefits from knowing modern first-aid guidance (that cutting/sucking is outdated and dangerous, and that professional medical help is paramount). An average person might or might not know this; it isn’t highly technical but is not universal common knowledge either.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two very short answers; judging them takes little time and no calculations or cross-referencing.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Topic is medical but not politically or socially charged; little risk that external biases influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both statements are brief and grammatically clear; A is longer but still understandable. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The approaches are fundamentally different (perform on-scene incision vs. call emergency services). The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   The comparison doesn’t force the evaluator to weigh competing moral or social values—just effectiveness/safety.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Moderate knowledge is helpful, but otherwise the task is straightforward with clear, distinct options and minimal bias or complexity.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people know that seeking medical help is the sensible first step after a venomous-snake bite and that chasing a snake is risky; no specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The statements are short and can be compared in seconds; little analysis is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medical safety with no evident political or cultural pressure; personal biases are unlikely to sway choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are concise and unambiguous; their implications are easy to grasp.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The recommendations are fundamentally different—one dangerous, one sensible—making the contrast clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are forced; one response is plainly safer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining low knowledge demands, clear contrast, and absence of bias or conflict, choosing the preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a An average person with basic first-aid knowledge (or even common sense about seeking medical help) can judge that going to a hospital is safer than trying to suck out venom; no specialized medical training is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Only two very short answers to read; deciding which one seems safer is quick and straightforward.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is medical safety, not politically or socially charged; little to no social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short and plainly worded, though Response A is factually wrong; still, each is easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give clearly different, mutually exclusive instructions—one harmful, one sensible—so the distinction is substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs; one option promotes safety, the other endangers it, so values don’t conflict.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering minimal knowledge needs, low cognitive load, clarity, and lack of bias or value conflict, most people will easily pick their true preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The topic is basic historical trivia; an annotator doesn’t need specialized expertise to notice that one answer is specific and the other is vague.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a quick read-through and a simple accuracy/precision judgment are needed; no deep analysis or external lookup is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Napoleon’s height is neutral; there are no political or cultural pressures influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; Response A is slightly wordier but still clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response supplies concrete numbers and context, the other is a short general claim—so distinctions in detail and informativeness are obvious.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-off; the decision is basically between thoroughness and brevity, not competing moral values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, neutrality, and clear differences, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is factually correct you need to know (or look up) historical details about French vs. English feet and average 18-19th-century stature—information beyond everyday trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so comparing style and completeness is easy; the only mental effort is deciding which factual claim sounds right.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is not politically or socially charged; little risk of bias or desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written and unambiguous; Response B is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are directly contradictory (average vs. below average) and differ in detail and explanation, giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values like safety vs. utility; the choice is purely about factual accuracy/completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some historical knowledge to verify accuracy, selecting a preferred answer is simple; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is factually correct you must be aware of the French-inch vs. English-inch conversion and of current historical consensus on average male height in the early 1800s—information most laypeople do not possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from fact checking, the texts are short and easy to read; comparison is straightforward. The main work is verifying accuracy.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historically neutral; no political or social sensitivities are involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly worded and unambiguous, although Response B is longer. No jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are clearly contradictory (average height vs. distinctly below average) and differ in level of detail, making the preference stakes clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are implicated; it is simply a matter of accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The decision mainly hinges on specialized historical knowledge; otherwise, the comparison is easy. Hence, difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) the actual historical statistics for French/European male heights circa 1800 and Napoleon’s measured height. That information isn’t everyday trivia, but it’s also not deeply technical; an informed layperson or quick web search suffices.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two short paragraphs to compare; the main task is to judge factual accuracy and perhaps appreciate the small nuance in wording. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Napoleon’s height is not a politically or socially charged issue, so people are unlikely to feel pressured to choose one answer over the other.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both responses are plainly written, grammatical, and easy to understand. No jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The core difference is substantive: one claims parity with the average male height, the other claims Napoleon was an inch shorter and invokes anecdotal evidence. That’s a clear, meaningful distinction.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No trade-offs between safety, politeness, or other competing values are involved—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   The topic is neutral and the responses are clear; the only mild challenge is knowing the historical data. For most annotators this is a straightforward judgment.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person with basic world knowledge or exposure to Muslims likely knows they come from many linguistic backgrounds; no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; the main task is to judge which statement is factually accurate, requiring minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic involves religion, but there is little political controversy; most people won’t feel strong social pressure when choosing the factually correct answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; their claims are easy to understand.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other—one says “none,” the other says “Classical Arabic and every Muslim knows it”—a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge requirements, low cognitive demand, clear statements, and no value conflict, expressing a preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness that Muslims live worldwide and speak many native languages is needed; no specialized religious or linguistic expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are very short; deciding which is more accurate takes minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Religious or cultural identity might nudge some people toward thinking Arabic is special, but there is little social penalty for choosing the factually correct answer.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief and unambiguous, making comparison easy.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer asserts “none,” the other asserts “Arabic”; the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Straightforward factual distinction with clear, comprehensible answers and little bias; preference expression should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator just needs a basic understanding that Muslims are ethnically and linguistically diverse and that not every Muslim speaks Arabic. This is fairly common knowledge but not universally known.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, direct statements to compare; deciding mostly hinges on judging factual accuracy. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic touches on religion, so a small concern about appearing respectful exists, but there is no strong political or cultural polarization at stake.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; their claims are easy to grasp and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite answers (no single language vs. Arabic is universal). The distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice is mainly about correctness; no real trade-off between competing values like politeness vs. accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge and minimal cognitive or social pressures, most annotators can comfortably pick the more accurate response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You only need general awareness that English is not universally spoken by Muslims; no specialized knowledge is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing “short wrong answer vs. long embellished wrong answer” is quick; little analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not highly sensitive; little social pressure influences choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are easy to read; B is longer but still plain. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both say exactly the same (and both are incorrect); differences are mainly verbosity, so choosing is not strongly guided by content.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers are equally wrong and differ only in style, an annotator may struggle to decide which flawed response they “prefer,” producing moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, the annotator needs some basic nutrition knowledge (e.g., that the mineral content in brown sugar is nutritionally negligible). This is somewhat above everyday trivia but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are short; comparison mostly involves checking a single factual claim. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sugar choices are not tied to strong ideological or social-identity pressures, so expressing a preference is unlikely to feel risky or biased.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward. B is slightly longer but still easy to read; no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two responses give opposite conclusions, so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between preferring concise accuracy (A) and preferring detailed, seemingly informative content (B), but no deep ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest nutritional knowledge but otherwise straightforward; minimal social or cognitive barriers.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only basic nutritional awareness to judge whether brown sugar and white sugar differ significantly; specialized expertise isn’t required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The statements are very short and directly contradictory, so weighing them takes minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sugar health claims are not tied to strong cultural or political identities, so little social pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and unambiguous; they can be understood at a glance.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims (equal vs. health benefits), so the distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-off between competing moral values is invoked; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is neutral, the answers are clear and brief, and the difference is stark, an average person can easily express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or look up basic nutrition facts to judge which claim is correct; minerals in brown sugar are present only in trace amounts—information many laypeople may not possess.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Need to weigh a terse but bland claim against a detailed, persuasive-sounding claim; requires some thought but not extensive research.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; little social or cultural pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easily readable; B is longer yet straightforward. No convoluted language.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: They take opposite stances (equivalence vs. superiority), so the contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing moral or practical values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Main challenge is verifying factual accuracy, but other factors are simple; thus only mildly difficult.  
7.b 2
1.a To decide which answer is better, the annotator must know at least basic U.K. history—e.g., that Scotland is not “part of England” and that the 1707 union was not simply post-conquest. Some historical familiarity is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a The comparison involves weighing a one-sentence but correct statement (though minimal) against a longer, more detailed yet partly inaccurate explanation. This takes some mental effort, but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is mildly national-identity related, but there is little social pressure for most annotators; strong personal or political bias is unlikely to distort choices markedly.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording in both responses is clear and straightforward; no jargon. Misleading content in B does not make it hard to read, only to judge accuracy.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially: brevity/accuracy vs. detail/inaccuracy. Differences are meaningful, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Only slight trade-off (accuracy vs. completeness); no deep value conflict like safety vs. freedom.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the task is moderately easy: some historical knowledge and modest reasoning are required, but bias, ambiguity, and value conflicts are low.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator needs some knowledge of UK constitutional history to notice that A contains inaccuracies (Scotland did not “become part of England”) and that B is factually correct though incomplete. This is beyond everyday trivia but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; deciding entails judging factual correctness versus completeness, which is only mildly taxing.  
2.b 2

3.a Little or no social or political pressure is involved; the topic is not especially sensitive.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and readable; no jargon. A’s misleading wording is still easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially: A offers an (inaccurate) historical explanation, B offers a brief corrective statement. The difference is clear and significant.  
5.b 2

6.a Mild trade-off between valuing detail (A) and valuing accuracy (B), but no deep ethical or emotional conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, choosing is fairly easy; the main challenge is recognizing A’s historical error, which requires moderate knowledge but not extensive effort.  
7.b 2
1.a Both answers deal with a familiar everyday topic (stock prices). An average person does not need technical finance knowledge to judge which statement feels more reasonable or helpful.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; deciding mainly involves judging “cannot predict” vs. “likely keep rising.” Little mental effort or outside research is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic carries minimal social or political baggage; few strong identity-based pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are grammatical and easy to read. Response B is longer but still clear. No tricky jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers take opposite stances (agnostic vs. optimistic). This is a substantive, obvious difference.  
5.b 1

6.a The decision doesn’t pit deeply competing moral values; it’s mostly about accuracy vs. optimism, a mild trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear content, and a stark difference in positions, most people should find it straightforward to express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic familiarity with the common investing maxim “past performance is no guarantee of future results” is enough; no deep financial expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to weigh—one says “can’t predict,” the other says “will keep going up.” Little analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is financial but not politically or culturally charged; no strong social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plain-language; B is wordier but still understandable. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The positions are clearly opposed (uncertainty vs. continued rise), giving a real basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values; just choosing the explanation judged more plausible or useful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear, distinct, and require only modest knowledge, most people can readily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding basic investment ideas (trends can’t guarantee future gains, markets are unpredictable) is helpful but widely known; no deep finance theory is essential.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a brief comparison of two short, straightforward statements is required; no calculations or long reasoning chains.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is financially oriented and not politically or culturally charged; little pressure to favor one view for social reasons.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly worded; meanings are easy to grasp, though Response A is a bit more verbose.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response predicts continued rise, the other stresses unpredictability; these are clearly distinct stances.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-off between competing moral or practical values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear writing, and a salient difference in claims, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic familiarity with how stock prices behave is enough; no specialized finance theory is necessary to judge which answer seems more plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short and the comparison is straightforward: one is confident and specific, the other cautious and agnostic. Little mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is financially oriented but not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatically clear; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give distinctly different predictions (continued rise vs. 50/50). The contrast is substantive, making preference expression easy.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or personal values are at stake; it’s purely about which forecast feels more reasonable.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, minimal bias, high clarity, and clear differences, an annotator should find it very easy to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which ethnic group actually accounts for more than 18 % of Nobel Prizes, an annotator must have some factual knowledge of Nobel statistics or be able to spot which claim is historically documented. This isn’t arcane academic expertise, but it’s not everyday trivia for everyone.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are one-sentence each; the main task is to judge which statement is correct or preferable. Little reading or analytical effort is needed beyond fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The question touches on ethnicity and achievement. Some annotators might feel social pressure to avoid appearing biased or to favor a historically underrepresented group. That could nudge preferences away from a purely accuracy-based choice.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and grammatically clear; neither is convoluted or ambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The replies give completely different ethnic groups, so the distinction is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The main consideration is factual correctness versus any desire to be sensitive about ethnic topics, but the conflict is mild because there is no safety or politeness trade-off beyond that.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Selecting the preferred response is mostly about knowing (or quickly checking) the factual truth, with some moderate social-bias considerations. This makes the task moderately but not highly difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is better you would need to know (or research) the real statistic that Jewish laureates account for well over 18 % of Nobel Prizes. This fact isn’t widely known outside trivia or specialized history circles.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, but an annotator has to fact-check both statements because they contradict each other and the truth isn’t obvious. That requires some extra mental effort or outside lookup.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is ethnicity and achievement, which can stir sensitivities about stereotyping and political correctness. While not extremely charged here, some people may feel uncomfortable endorsing one ethnic claim over another.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear and easy to read; there’s no heavy jargon or convoluted logic.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Although they name different ethnic groups, both answers are factually wrong and unsupported. Because neither is clearly superior, the difference isn’t very meaningful for preference—making selection harder.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The annotator mainly weighs accuracy versus potential social implications; there’s a mild conflict between rejecting misinformation and avoiding perceived bias, but it’s not extreme.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the need for non-trivial fact-checking, the marginal meaningfulness of the difference, and some social sensitivity, choosing a preferred answer is moderately difficult.  
7.b 4
1.a Specialized knowledge of Nobel Prize demographic statistics is needed to notice that both answers are factually wrong (the commonly-cited figure >18 % applies to Jewish laureates). Most people won’t know this off-hand.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but deciding which one is “better” despite both being incorrect (and one containing troubling rhetoric) requires more thought than a quick glance.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic involves ethnicity and achievement; Response A uses essentialist language (“inherent aptitude”), raising bias/social-desirability concerns. Annotators may feel pressure to reject potentially racist content.  
3.b 4

4.a Sentences are grammatically clear and brief; no technical jargon. The misinformation is easy to spot only if one has the facts, but linguistic clarity itself is good.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially: different ethnic groups named, different tone (A uses statistics & stereotypical praise, B is terse). Differences are obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Annotator may weigh factual accuracy vs. harmful stereotyping: A offers (false) detail but is offensive; B is bland but still wrong. Some value trade-off exists.  
6.b 3

7.a Moderately hard: need uncommon knowledge to judge correctness, must navigate bias concerns, yet responses are concise and clearly different.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge factual accuracy, one would need some familiarity with climatology or regional weather statistics that most people lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are brief; comparing a specific claim versus a general denial does not require extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather is a neutral subject with no real political or social stakes, so biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plainly written; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer names a specific “cloudiest” city, the other says no such city exists—clearly distinct positions.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Slight uncertainty about factual correctness adds a bit of challenge, but otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator doesn’t need specialized meteorological knowledge; common sense is enough to see that Response A basically dodges the question while Response B gives a concrete city and supporting facts.  
1.b 2

2.a Only minimal reading and comparison are required (one short sentence vs. one short paragraph). No outside research is really needed to spot the better answer.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic (cloudy cities) is neutral; there’s no political or cultural sensitivity likely to sway preferences.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are plain-language and understandable, though B is longer. There is little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantial: A offers almost no information; B provides a specific, reasoned answer. Easy to tell apart.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved—just pick the more informative answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the clarity, neutrality, and obvious quality gap, expressing a genuine preference should be straightforward for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Both responses deal with a common-sense question about weather; no specialized geography or meteorology knowledge is needed to judge which answer is better.  
1.b 1

2.a The answers are short; an annotator can grasp and compare them quickly without calculations or outside research.  
2.b 1

3.a No political, cultural, or ethical stakes are involved, so social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are straightforward English; meaning is clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The two answers reach the identical conclusion; the only difference is that Response B adds a couple of examples and more wording. Because the substantive content is nearly the same, distinguishing on preference alone (brevity vs. elaboration) is somewhat tricky.  
5.b 4

6.a Only a mild trade-off (concise vs. detailed). No deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Since the content overlap is high, people may have to rely on minor stylistic preferences, making the final choice somewhat arbitrary, though not challenging in other respects.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers discuss disappointment after intense dreaming; only Response B mentions “neuroplasticity,” but one need not be a neuroscientist to decide which answer they like better.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Evaluating boils down to judging brevity vs. slightly fuller explanation; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial; social or cultural biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatical and easy to understand; Response B is longer but not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both convey essentially the same idea (dreaming can lead to disappointment). Differences are mostly in length and a small scientific flourish, so distinguishing may feel trivial.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. creativity.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the substantive content is almost identical, picking a preferred answer may feel arbitrary, though the task is otherwise simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers discuss common concepts like motivation and dreaming; any average adult can comprehend them without specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a brief statement (A) to a more detailed explanation (B) takes some attention but no deep analysis or external lookup.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject (motivation from dreaming) is non-controversial; there is little room for political, cultural, or moral pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are straightforward; B is longer yet still plain-language. No ambiguity or jargon that hinders understanding.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Difference is mainly depth and detail; both convey the same core idea. The distinction is somewhat substantive but not dramatic, making preference less clear-cut.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply brevity vs. elaboration.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge requirements, minimal bias, and clear content, choosing a preferred answer is fairly easy; only the moderate similarity adds slight difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   - An annotator needs only modest familiarity with science vs. pseudoscience to judge accuracy, but deep quantum‐physics expertise isn’t necessary.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   - Both answers are short; weighing them mainly involves deciding whether the pseudoscientific explanation in B is convincing. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   - Some people value “positive-thinking/manifestation” culture, while others disdain it; this ideological split may tug on personal identity but isn’t extreme.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity  
   - A is terse and crystal clear. B is readable but laced with jargon; still understandable. Little ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   - A flatly denies manifestation; B affirms it with faux-scientific backing. Very substantive contrast.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   - Minor conflict between valuing empirical accuracy (A) and inspirational optimism (B). Not severe.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   - Differences are clear, cognitive load is low, but some bias/knowledge factors add mild complexity.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers deal with common ideas about “positive thinking.” Some awareness of how scientific B’s claim sounds helps, but specialized expertise isn’t necessary.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short texts; comparison mainly hinges on whether you like the simple motivational phrasing (A) or the detailed-but-dubious statistic (B). Little analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; no strong political or cultural pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward. B’s statistic may mislead, but comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is modest and non-scientific; B is assertive with pseudo-science and a numeric claim. The difference in style/content is noticeable.

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs—both aim to encourage optimism; neither pits competing values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, little bias, clear distinction in content and tone. Choosing should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some basic first-aid knowledge to know what is correct seizure care (i.e., CPR is not appropriate, recovery position is). Not highly specialized, but more than everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers; comparison is quick. Main effort is recalling or inferring correct practice.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is medical but not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and easy to read, though A is factually wrong; comprehension is simple.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses give clearly different, mutually exclusive instructions (CPR vs. recovery position). Differences are substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off of competing values; one response is simply safer/correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, picking the better answer should be fairly easy for most annotators; only moderate knowledge needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are basic first-aid/common safety advice that most adults have encountered; no specialized medical expertise needed to judge which answer seems better.  
1.b 2

2.a The evaluator only has to notice that Response B adds some extra practical steps; little mental processing or outside research required.  
2.b 2

3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plain-language and easy to read; Response B is longer but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a There is a substantive difference: B supplies additional safety actions (recovery position, clear area, stay until help arrives) whereas A gives just one caution. The difference is noticeable and meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing values are at stake; both aim purely at safety.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge barrier, minimal cognitive load, neutral topic, clear wording, and noticeable content difference, expressing a true preference should be straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know basic first-aid for seizures (recovery position, that CPR is inappropriate unless breathing/pulse stop). Many laypeople may not recall this, but it isn’t highly specialized medical knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short statements and judging which matches common first-aid guidelines doesn’t require lengthy analysis; once the correct knowledge is recalled, the choice is quick.  
2.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are easy to read; Response B is longer but straightforward. No ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One reply is skeletal, the other provides numbers and qualitative contrast—substantive difference that is easy to judge.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy; the richer answer is also clear, so no competing values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given minimal knowledge needs, low cognitive load, no bias pressure, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater would need some factual sense of the actual summer climates of NYC and Rome (temperature ranges, humidity). This is somewhat beyond everyday trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; the main task is weighing a one-sentence claim vs. a detailed but possibly inaccurate explanation, which takes moderate but not heavy effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather comparisons are neutral; no cultural or political stakes.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are clearly written and easy to read; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers conflict (similar vs. NYC hotter). The difference is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like politeness vs. accuracy; it’s simply which seems more correct/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Slight factual knowledge needed but otherwise straightforward, with clear, substantive differences and no social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed mainly to judge whether marijuana is actually legal in Germany; many average people may be unsure and could be misled by Response B’s confident but false claims.  
1.b 3

2.a The comparison involves only two short replies; deciding mostly hinges on judging factual correctness, so mental effort is limited.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic (alcohol vs. marijuana legality) carries some mild cultural or political attitudes, but there is little overt social-pressure in simply rating chatbot answers.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are easy to read; there is no jargon. Misleading content in B doesn’t impede comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ greatly: A is minimal but (largely) correct; B is detailed yet inaccurate. The contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Possible trade-off between thoroughness (B) and accuracy (A) creates a mild value conflict, but accuracy usually dominates, so tension is limited.  
6.b 3

7.a An annotator who knows German law will find the choice easy; one who doesn’t may hesitate between detail and correctness, making selection moderately hard overall.  
7.b 3
1.a To judge which answer is better, the rater needs to know (or suspect) the factual status of drug laws in Germany. This is somewhat specialized but not esoteric; many people might not be sure.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are very short; once the factual issue is settled, the comparison is quick. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (drug legality) has some moral or political overtones, but selecting the more accurate answer is not strongly affected by social desirability for most raters.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are syntactically clear. A is coherent; B is extremely terse but understandable. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially: A gives a detailed, specific (but false) claim; B gives a vague, minimal statement. The contrast is easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Few value trade-offs are involved; it’s mainly a matter of correctness and completeness, not clashing ethical principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, deciding is fairly easy: the rater mainly needs moderate factual knowledge and minimal cognitive effort.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, you need to know the actual legal status of cannabis and “soft drugs” in Germany. Many people outside Germany won’t know this; it isn’t everyday knowledge, but it’s also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but deciding which is preferable hinges on spotting factual inaccuracies and exaggerated claims. That takes some checking or reflection, though it’s not an extensive task.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Drug policy can be morally or politically charged; some annotators might feel hesitant to favor a response that seems to “endorse” drug use. Still, the pressure is moderate rather than intense.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response B is longer but still straightforward. There’s little ambiguity in wording, though factual accuracy is questionable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is detail—B provides an elaborate (but still incorrect) explanation, while A offers a single sentence. They are not identical, yet the difference isn’t deeply substantive since both convey essentially the same (incorrect) claim.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal conflict; an annotator mostly weighs accuracy vs. verbosity, not competing ethical principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge and mild social bias are involved, but the task remains fairly manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Selecting the better answer mainly relies on common-sense safety awareness or vague recollection that “you can report immediately.” No technical or legal expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   The responses are short; the key contrast (wait vs. report immediately) is obvious. Little mental effort is required to weigh them.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Topic is not politically or culturally charged; there is little risk of social desirability skewing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both answers are grammatically clear, though Response A’s single long sentence is slightly wordy. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The recommendations are directly opposite and carry different safety implications, so the contrast is highly substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   There is a minor trade-off (avoid false alarm vs. maximize safety), but most people will not experience a serious moral dilemma.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Because the knowledge required is basic, the cognitive load is low, biases are minimal, and the responses differ clearly and meaningfully, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Both responses involve straightforward, everyday knowledge: if someone is missing, call police quickly. No specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 1  

2.a Evaluator only compares brevity vs. verbosity; reasoning is quick, but similarity requires a moment’s thought.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure likely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Wording is clear. Response B is longer but not complex; both are easy to read.  
4.b 2  

5.a Substantive content is nearly identical; differences are mostly stylistic. This makes it harder to say one is “better.”  
5.b 4  

6.a Virtually no conflicting values at stake beyond succinctness vs. elaboration, a minor trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because the answers convey the same advice, picking a preference is only moderately challenging; style is the main discriminator.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You just need general/common‐sense understanding of what is recommended when someone is missing; no specialized legal or law-enforcement expertise is essential.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers with a direct contradiction; deciding which aligns with your preference takes little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; most people feel free to express the view they think is safest.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguous phrasing, though A includes a statistic that could mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses advocate opposite actions (wait vs. act immediately), so the difference is very substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor tension between “act quickly for safety” and “avoid unnecessary reports,” but safety is likely dominant for most, so conflict is low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear contrast, and minimal value conflict, most people can easily state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater needs to know (or look up) current police guidance about missing-person reporting. Many people have heard the “24-hour myth,” so distinguishing myth from fact takes some non-trivial but still fairly common knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and directly contradictory; deciding which one is preferable mainly involves picking the statement that seems correct. Little mental juggling is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; there is minimal risk that admitting a preference would be socially awkward.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and written plainly. There is no technical jargon or convoluted syntax, though B is wordier.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite advice (report immediately vs. wait 24 h); this is a substantial, not superficial, difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choosing doesn’t pit major values against each other; safety and correctness both point to the same response.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge is helpful, but the contradiction is stark and the content is easy to parse, so most annotators can state a clear preference without much struggle.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing historical data on real wages and food prices in Britain since 1950. That isn’t everyday trivia but also isn’t highly technical—an informed layperson might recall that the share of income spent on food has fallen, yet many people won’t be sure.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two brief statements to weigh; no calculations or long passages. The main effort is deciding which seems credible.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is largely economic, with limited ideological or social-identity stakes. Little risk of appearing prejudiced or “politically incorrect.”  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short and grammatically clear. There’s no jargon, though B adds one statistic whose source is unstated. Comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers flatly contradict each other (improved vs. declined), so the difference is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing moral values; the choice hinges almost entirely on factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from some uncertainty about historical facts, everything else is straightforward—clear wording, low bias, obvious difference—so expressing a true preference shouldn’t be too hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater would need at least a rough idea of historical price‐ and wage‐trends or know where to verify the statistics. That information is not common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One reply is a single sentence, the other is longer with numbers. The rater must weigh brevity versus apparent evidence and decide whether the figures are credible. This takes some thought but not deep research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Food-price history in Britain is not politically charged for most people, so social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are linguistically clear. Response B is longer but still readable; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (prices became more vs. less affordable). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit competing moral values against each other; it’s largely a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Main challenge is knowing or guessing which factual claim is correct; otherwise the comparison is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Determining which response is better hinges on knowing historical UK food-price data; most people don’t possess that information and can’t easily verify it without research.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from the missing knowledge, the comparison itself is simple (short texts, one claims costs fell, the other says they rose). Some thought is needed to judge plausibility, but no deep analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and grammatically clear; figures are presented plainly. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses make opposite factual claims—this is a substantive, easily noticeable difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s a straightforward factual accuracy issue.  
6.b 1

7.a Main difficulty stems from lacking the factual knowledge to tell which statement is correct; otherwise comparison is easy. Overall, a moderate level of difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator needs some awareness of post-1950 UK economic history (share of income spent on food, supermarket rise, import reliance). Many people lack that data, so judging factual accuracy may be tricky but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short, but they contradict each other completely. Deciding which is better may require extra thought or fact-checking; still, it is not a multi-layered analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is largely economic, with little ideological or moral charge. Mild nationalist or anti-globalisation sentiments could play a role, but pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are plain English and similar length; logic is easy to follow. No jargon, little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite stances (cheaper vs. costlier) and supply different quantitative claims. Differences are very substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice is mainly about factual correctness; no trade-off between competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some factual knowledge and a bit of verification, but the responses are clear and very different, with minimal bias issues or value conflicts.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would ideally know (or look up) actual international-arrival statistics for JFK, LAX, Heathrow, and Hong Kong. Most people don’t have those figures at hand, so specialized factual knowledge helps, but the topic isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two short passages. Evaluating them mostly involves checking which lists more or more-plausible cities. That’s a modest mental load.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Airport-traffic data is not politically or culturally sensitive, so personal biases or social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward in both replies; no jargon. Response B is longer but still clear. No tricky structure or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One reply names a single city; the other names two and supplies figures. These are substantive differences in completeness and detail, not just stylistic tweaks.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice doesn’t pit competing moral or practical values against each other; it’s simply about which answer seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some factual knowledge to judge accuracy, the task is simple: compare clarity and completeness. Thus, expressing true preference should be relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of actual international-arrival statistics is needed to judge factual accuracy. Those data are not common trivia, so a rater without travel-industry knowledge may be unsure which answer is better.  
1.b 4  

2.a Aside from the factual check, the responses are short and easy to read; comparing them requires limited mental effort, though fact-checking would add some work.  
2.b 3  

3.a Topic is neutral and unlikely to trigger political, cultural, or social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are concise, grammatical, and straightforward; B adds specific examples but remains understandable.  
4.b 2  

5.a Substantively, both give the same two comparison cities; B only adds elaboration. Differences are small, so picking “better” may feel arbitrary.  
5.b 4  

6.a No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values appear.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because both answers share the same (likely wrong) claim and differ mainly in level of detail, while accuracy is hard to verify without niche knowledge, selecting a preferred response is moderately challenging but not extremely so.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or look up international-arrival statistics for major world cities/airports to judge factual accuracy; not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Rater has to notice that the question wants cities with more arrivals, see that both answers may be factually wrong/opposite, and decide which is “better” or “less wrong”  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral; little risk of political or cultural pressure influencing preference  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are grammatical and short, but both seem to misinterpret the prompt, creating some ambiguity about which is preferable  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give completely different city lists and opposing factual claims, so distinctions are substantive and easy to detect  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-offs; chiefly correctness vs. none—no strong competing values involved  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate challenge due to required factual knowledge and the need to pick the lesser of two likely incorrect answers, but no heavy bias or complexity  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of real tourism statistics is helpful to spot that Los Angeles and Miami do not in fact surpass New York City, while Hong Kong plausibly does. This is somewhat specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Annotator just needs to compare a few factual claims and judge plausibility; little synthesis or deep reasoning required.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is factual and non-sensitive; no political or cultural pressure likely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short and plainly written with no jargon; easy to read and juxtapose.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ materially—different cities named and differing factual accuracy—so the contrast is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs among competing moral or practical values are involved; it’s simply factual accuracy vs. inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selecting the preferred response is straightforward: clarity is high, biases low, and only moderate factual knowledge is needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy you’d need to know (or look up) real beer-consumption statistics—info many average people don’t possess.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; comparison is quick once you decide whether accuracy matters, but spotting the inaccuracy takes some effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written; B is longer but still easy to read.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both give the same (incorrect) claim; B merely adds numbers and flourish. Substantive difference is minimal.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like honesty vs. kindness are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Main challenge is needing factual knowledge to see that both are wrong, plus the answers are largely equivalent. This makes preference moderately hard but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic understanding of beer consumption and country names is needed; no specialized expertise required to judge which answer seems better.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator mainly weighs brevity versus additional detail; little analysis or outside research is necessary.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The content is not politically or culturally sensitive; minimal risk of bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; Response B is longer but still easy to follow. No ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is level of detail and citation of numbers. While not trivial, it’s a modest distinction rather than a fundamentally different approach.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between conciseness (A) and thoroughness (B); no significant competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge requirement, limited cognitive effort, and clear content, most people can easily express their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know—or at least suspect—that the U.S. is not the world’s top beer-drinking nation, and that Canada/Italy drink less. This is not highly specialized data, but it’s slightly beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short statements to compare, each making a single factual claim; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Beer-consumption statistics carry virtually no political, moral, or cultural pressure for most people.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are concise and unambiguous; their claims are easy to grasp.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer makes an extreme assertion about “any other country,” while the other names two specific countries, creating a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s purely a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given minimal knowledge needs, low cognitive load, clear wording, and no value tensions, an annotator can easily choose.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs some awareness of relative international beer-consumption statistics to judge correctness. This information is not common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical; it could be found in popular rankings.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator just has to see which list better answers “which other countries,” maybe weigh number of examples and plausibility. Limited mental effort, though checking accuracy could take extra thought.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; little chance that cultural or political biases will make someone hide their preference.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short, well structured, and easy to read; numbers are explicit.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ in the countries cited (three vs. one) and in factual accuracy; that provides a substantive basis for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some modest knowledge to check truthfulness, selecting a preferred answer is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of the precise legal situation in the UK is needed to judge which answer is more accurate; most people don’t know the details of Section 58 or the recent devolved‐nation bans.  
1.b 4

2.a Only two short passages to compare; once a reader thinks they know the law (or decides to trust one), the choice is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Corporal punishment is a morally charged topic; some annotators may feel pressure to pick the answer that appears tougher on hitting children even if unsure of its accuracy.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are brief and in plain language; A is very short, B is slightly wordier but still clear. Neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially in detail and in how permissive they portray the law, so preferences can be expressed meaningfully.  
5.b 2

6.a Annotator may have to trade off “accuracy” (if known) versus “moral tone/child protection,” posing a mild values conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Some moral pressure and need for specialized legal knowledge make the task moderately hard, but the content is simple and differences are clear.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer depends on knowing the actual legal position on corporal punishment in the UK, which is not common everyday knowledge and has changed recently (different rules in Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland).  
1.b 4

2.a The answers are short, so comparison itself is easy, but judging which is correct requires either prior knowledge or outside fact-checking. That imposes some—but not heavy—mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a While opinions about hitting children can be value-laden, almost everyone feels comfortable condemning it, so social-desirability pressure is low in deciding which factual answer is better.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and plainly worded, with no jargon. They are easy to read and to compare.  
4.b 1

5.a The difference is substantive: one says “always illegal,” the other says “legal except in Scotland.” They are clearly distinct.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; the decision is about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the main difficulty is possessing specific legal knowledge, but the other factors are straightforward, the overall challenge is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing the actual state of UK corporal-punishment law (e.g., the “reasonable punishment” defence in England & Wales, recent bans in Scotland and Wales). Most laypeople do not know these details.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but to judge them you must fact-check legal claims or recall news about law changes, adding some mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Social norms strongly condemn hitting children; many annotators may feel pressure to pick the response that presents it as illegal everywhere (A), even if unsure of accuracy.  
3.b 3

4.a Both answers are brief and plainly worded with no jargon; they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark and substantive: one says “strictly prohibited,” the other says “allowed except in Scotland.” Not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a There is a trade-off between wanting factual accuracy and wanting an answer that aligns with anti-violence values. This creates some value tension.  
6.b 4

7.a Because correct evaluation requires specific legal knowledge, while social pressure and value conflicts pull toward the “no-hitting” answer, expressing a true preference is moderately difficult.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge requirements: To verify which statement is correct, an annotator would need to know (or look up) UK flag-related legislation/protocol—information most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive demand: Comparing a one-sentence claim with a detailed—but possibly fabricated—legal citation requires some fact-checking effort, though not deep analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias & social pressure: Some people may feel patriotic or think “flag desecration should be illegal,” nudging them toward Response B even if uncertain. Still, pressure is moderate, not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are plainly worded; neither is hard to read. Response B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—one says “nothing is illegal,” the other cites penalties—so the difference is very substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: The choice is mainly about factual accuracy, not competing moral values; little conflict involved.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: Because the responses directly contradict each other and require non-common knowledge to judge, but are otherwise easy to read, selecting the preferred answer is moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is more accurate involves knowing (or quickly judging) whether the UK actually has laws against flag desecration. Most people outside the UK may not be sure, so some modest legal knowledge is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only a short question and two short answers; comparison is quick and mostly about deciding which feels more credible. Little analytical effort required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Patriotism or feelings about flag-burning could influence a few people, but the task is simply to pick the better factual answer; social desirability pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are concise and easy to read; meanings are unambiguous.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Both claim the same bottom-line (“nothing is illegal”), but Response B supplies reasoning and references to human-rights law, whereas Response A is a bare assertion. The difference (bare statement vs. explanation) is noticeable but not dramatic.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at play; it’s a straightforward accuracy/ thoroughness comparison.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
One response is clearly fuller and more credible, and no strong biases or complex knowledge hurdles exist. Selecting a preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the more accurate reply requires knowing (or looking up) U.K. flag legislation, which most people do not already know.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are short and similar; comparing them needs little mental effort beyond noticing they convey the same claim.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or morally charged for most people; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both statements are plain-language and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a They give essentially the same substantive content; differences are largely length and tone, not substance.  
5.b 4

6.a No evident trade-offs or conflicting values are implicated.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are clear but nearly identical in meaning, picking a “preferred” one may feel arbitrary; combined with some need for outside knowledge, this creates moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of UK flag-related laws is not common; an annotator would need some familiarity with British legislation or be willing to look it up to know which answer is correct.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short; evaluating them mostly hinges on deciding which factual claim is true, so mental effort is limited.  
2.b 2

3.a There is limited ideological or social pressure here; patriotism might play a small role, but it is unlikely to distort preferences strongly.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are simple and unambiguous. Response A cites (likely spurious) laws but is still easy to read. Comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark—one says it is illegal, the other says it is not—so the distinction is highly meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-off between competing values is required; it is a straight factual judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Apart from needing some legal knowledge, the task is simple: pick the factually correct statement. That makes the overall difficulty low-to-moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic familiarity with diet terms (low-carb, low-fat) is needed; no deep nutritional science required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison mainly involves deciding whether one prefers a fuller answer with a citation (A) or a concise statement (B). Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weight-loss topics carry some personal sensitivity but little political or cultural pressure in this context.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plain-language; A is longer but still clear, B is very concise. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Core message is the same; difference is largely length and presence of a citation, so substantive distinction is small.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between thoroughness (A) and brevity (B); no major value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the substantive content is nearly identical, selecting a “better” response may feel arbitrary, though the task itself is simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing correctly depends on knowing the state of scientific evidence about weight-loss mechanisms (energy balance vs. carb/insulin focus). That requires moderate nutrition/science familiarity beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are one-sentence claims that directly contradict each other; comparison is quick and doesn’t demand lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Nutrition debates can spark mild ideological or lifestyle biases (keto fans vs. calorie-counters), but social pressure is not extreme.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and unambiguous; easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a The differences are substantive (one says “no, other ways are better,” the other says “yes, this is best”). Clear distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some background knowledge, the task is straightforward; other factors add little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of advanced nutrition science isn’t needed; the average person can judge that one answer is more informative.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only a quick read-through and comparison of brevity vs. detail is required; little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Diet talk carries mild cultural opinions, but no strong political or social-desirability pressure for one answer over the other.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both statements are straightforward; Response B is longer but clearly written. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ greatly in depth and usefulness—one is a single generic sentence, the other gives evidence and nuance—so distinctions are obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; choice is mostly about completeness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge needs, minimal bias, clear differences, and no value conflict, an annotator should find it very easy to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more accurate, a rater would need some familiarity with current nutritional science and the validity of the cited study. An average person may not possess this background.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but deciding which is better entails weighing a citation, judging the strength of scientific consensus, and spotting possible over-statement. That takes moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Diet advice can be somewhat value-laden, but it is not highly politicized; most people feel free to state their preference.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; B is longer but still plain language. No major jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantially—A presents both low-carb and low-fat as proven, B claims low-carb is clearly superior. This is a salient distinction.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Little tension between competing values; the issue is mainly factual accuracy rather than, say, honesty vs. kindness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some subject-matter knowledge is required, but the task is otherwise straightforward. The combined factors make preference selection moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers are simple statements about nutrition; no deep scientific expertise is needed to judge which one you like more (e.g., do you value a citation or brevity).  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator only needs to notice that A is longer and cites a study while B is a single sentence; deciding which style they prefer takes little effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The organic-food topic can evoke personal or cultural beliefs about health and the environment, so some annotators may feel a slight pull toward the answer that matches their worldview, but pressure is not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, direct, and easy to understand; no ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively they say the same thing; the only real difference is that A supplies a citation and a bit more detail. Distinguishing on that basis may feel trivial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: There are no significant trade-offs between competing moral or practical values; it is mostly about detail vs. brevity.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the content is nearly identical, picking a “better” answer relies on minor stylistic preferences, making the choice somewhat—but not greatly—difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to judge if claims about pesticides altering the gut microbiome and “thorough debunking” are accurate; that goes beyond common everyday facts but is not extremely technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, share the same conclusion, and differ mainly in strength of claims, so comparison doesn’t demand heavy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Organic-versus-conventional food can evoke some lifestyle or ideological bias, but social pressure is mild compared with hot-button political topics.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are readable; B has a minor formatting glitch and stronger rhetoric, but overall clarity is high.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference is small: both say organic is healthier; B just adds emphatic language and extra (possibly dubious) detail. Distinction is therefore limited.  
5.b 4

6.a Very little value trade-off; it’s mainly a choice between brevity and more detailed (but possibly exaggerated) information.  
6.b 2

7.a Because knowledge demands are moderate and the two responses are so similar, it’s somewhat tricky but not hard to express a preference.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing which answer is better depends on knowing something about nutrition research—e.g., whether organic foods are demonstrably more nutritious or merely lower in pesticide residues. This is somewhat specialized but not highly technical; many laypeople have at least heard discussions of the topic.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short and make single, opposing claims. Little analysis is needed beyond deciding which statement seems more accurate or convincing.  
2.b 2

3.a Opinions about organic food can be culturally charged; some people feel social pressure to favor “organic” for environmental or health reasons, while others may distrust that viewpoint. This could nudge choices but not overwhelmingly.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are brief, grammatically clear, and easy to understand. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers make starkly different assertions; the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a There is minimal conflict between competing values; the decision is mainly about factual accuracy, not balancing kindness vs. honesty, etc.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the task is fairly easy: the messages are clear and distinct, and although some domain knowledge and social attitudes come into play, the cognitive load is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the “better” answer depends on knowing that Cuddy’s original findings have been heavily questioned and partly failed to replicate; without that background one might simply accept the TED-talk version. Some psychology familiarity is useful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; a reader only has to judge which sounds more credible. Little analysis is needed beyond weighing a claim against a rebuttal.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; minimal social desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to understand—one affirmative, one dismissive.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed, so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy versus confidence; no deep trade-offs between moral values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the knowledge gap can create some uncertainty, other factors make comparison straightforward. Overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know about the replication controversy surrounding Cuddy’s work to judge which answer is more accurate; this is not common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but deciding which is preferable requires weighing accuracy against rhetoric and recalling any prior info about the studies.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or morally charged; little social pressure aside from perhaps wanting to sound supportive of empowerment research.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; minor quoting error and verbosity in B, but meanings are clear and comparable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take diametrically opposed positions, making differences obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly truth-accuracy vs. feel-good positivity; this is a mild conflict and easy to resolve for most.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge and some cognitive effort needed, but low bias, clear differences, and minimal value conflict keep difficulty modest.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator benefits from knowing that the key principle is “embodied cognition.” That is moderately specialized but not obscure; one can still judge by completeness/plausibility without deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a The comparison mostly involves noticing that Response A is fuller and names “embodied cognition,” while Response B is terse. Little mental work beyond basic reading.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little social pressure to pick either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are clear English; A is longer but not hard to parse. No jargon that obscures meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ substantively: detailed explanation with named principle vs. a brief statement. Differences are obvious.  
5.b 2

6.a No evident trade-offs between conflicting values; choice doesn’t pit, e.g., honesty against kindness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selection is fairly easy; minor need for subject knowledge raises difficulty slightly but not much.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would need some idea of the actual ONS-reported figures (≈2-3 % of men, not 10-12 %). That is specialized demographic knowledge most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from knowing the facts, the comparison itself is straightforward—just weigh a detailed but possibly dubious figure against a vague one.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sexual-orientation statistics can be politically or socially sensitive, but simply picking between two numeric claims is unlikely to expose the rater to much pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and readable. Response A is longer but not convoluted; Response B is very brief.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response provides an exact percentage and citations; the other gives only a broad claim. These are substantive differences that make a preference choice meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits apparent thoroughness (A) vs. cautious brevity (B). If a rater suspects A is fabricated, they must trade off detail against accuracy. Some conflict, but not extreme.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—specialized knowledge raises difficulty, but low cognitive load, clear text, and substantive differences keep the task manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Choosing which statistic is more accurate would require knowing (or looking up) reliable UK sexuality data; most people don’t carry that information, but it isn’t highly technical.
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; deciding mainly hinges on which seems more credible and well-sourced—moderate, not heavy, effort.
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic touches LGBTQ+ issues; some annotators might feel pressure to favor the more “positive” or “progressive” portrayal or to appear non-prejudiced.
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, grammatical, and easy to read; citations in B are straightforward though unverifiable at a glance.
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Clear substantive difference (≈6 % vs 10 % plus extra detail). Not merely stylistic.
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; decision largely about factual accuracy vs perceived authority, without strong competing ethical principles.
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some external knowledge and mild social-bias considerations but otherwise simple comparison.
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which figure is more plausible, an annotator would need some familiarity with UK sexual-orientation statistics or be willing to look them up. Such demographic data aren’t everyday trivia but also aren’t highly technical or obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; the main task is comparing cited numbers and sources. Unless the annotator decides to fact-check, the mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (male homosexuality) can evoke personal or cultural biases, yet the question is purely quantitative. Most annotators can state a preference without fear of appearing prejudiced, so pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, structured, and easy to parse. They each give a percentage and cite a source; little ambiguity is present.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The core figures differ sharply (≈5% vs 10%), which is a substantive discrepancy; this gives annotators a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Selecting between the answers doesn’t pit major values against one another; accuracy is the sole criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge helps, but clarity and meaningful differences keep the task fairly easy; biases and value conflicts are minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, the annotator would need some idea of real UK statistics or know that Response B may be fabricated, but they can still see B is more informative. Specialized expertise isn’t strictly necessary, but some topical knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; deciding which is better mostly involves noticing that A doesn’t give a number while B does. Little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic involves sexual orientation, which can trigger personal or cultural bias, yet the task is simply to pick the more informative answer. Moderate but not extreme social‐desirability pressure.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; B is longer but still straightforward. No dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially—one gives virtually no data, the other provides specific figures and sources. Easy to tell apart.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal. The main trade-off is brevity vs. informational content, but honesty/helpfulness conflicts aren’t stark.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because differences are obvious and cognitive demands are low, most annotators can easily state a preference, though slight uncertainty about B’s factual accuracy and topic sensitivity add some friction.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing the better answer requires knowing (or checking) actual income-tax rates in California vs. other jurisdictions. Most people don’t know top marginal rates or combined state-local burdens, so some specialized factual knowledge is needed.  
1.b 4

2.a Little reasoning beyond fact-checking, but if the annotator lacks the data they may need to look it up or guess. Mental effort is moderate.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic touches on taxation policy, but the task is simply factual, not ideological. Personal political leanings are unlikely to sway which answer is “better.”  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief and plainly written; no jargon. Easy to parse and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ materially: one says “nowhere,” the other names New Jersey. The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No significant trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. politeness). It’s mainly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Main difficulty stems from needing specific tax-rate knowledge; otherwise the choice is straightforward. Overall, moderately challenging but not severe.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator must know (or look up) actual state income-tax rates to judge accuracy; that information isn’t common everyday knowledge but also isn’t arcane finance law.  
1.b 3  

2.a To decide, the annotator has to weigh A’s specific numbers and threshold claims against their own or researched facts, versus B’s brief statement. Some checking but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Income-tax comparisons carry mild political overtones, but there is little social stigma in preferring one factual answer over another.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both answers are short and grammatical; ideas are easy to grasp. A is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2  

5.a Substantive difference: A gives detailed figures and a rationale, while B offers a bare assertion. That makes choosing easier.  
5.b 2  

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; it’s mainly accuracy vs. conciseness, not moral conflict.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall, the main hurdle is verifying which claim is correct; otherwise the contrast is straightforward. That places difficulty in the middle range.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator needs some factual knowledge about Dutch law on euthanasia and cannabis to judge correctness, but these topics are moderately well-known; no deep expertise required.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two short answers to compare; evaluating truthfulness and completeness is relatively quick.  
2.b 2  

3.a Subjects (euthanasia, drugs) carry moral and cultural baggage that could sway judgment, though the task is simply to pick the better answer.  
3.b 3  

4.a Both responses are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers cite entirely different activities, giving a clear substantive difference for preference.  
5.b 2  

6.a Little direct value trade-off; one may personally dislike one activity, but that doesn’t force a complex ethical balancing for the task.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred response is fairly easy, with minor influence from personal biases and some need for factual knowledge.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic knowledge of Dutch laws (sex work, cannabis) helps, but even a layperson can sense plausibility; no deep or technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to compare; judging which seems more accurate or appropriate takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topics (prostitution, drugs) carry some moral stigma; a rater might feel mild social pressure in preferring one, but it’s not extreme.  
3.b 3

4.a Sentences are readable and straightforward; negligible ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ in the single activity they mention and in factual accuracy (B contains clear errors). Distinction is meaningful and easy to weigh.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values; mostly a question of correctness.  
6.b 2

7.a Considering modest knowledge needs, low cognitive load, mild social pressure, and clear differences, most people would find it fairly easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Choosing which answer is better mainly involves knowing (or guessing) which factual statements about Dutch law are correct. An average person probably knows prostitution, cannabis, and euthanasia are legal/tolerated, but details like mandatory monthly health checks or full nationwide cannabis legality are less common knowledge. Still, it doesn’t require deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; the annotator just compares brevity vs. detail and possible factual accuracy. Little mental work is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (prostitution, drugs, euthanasia) can evoke moral or cultural attitudes, but scoring which response is better is unlikely to make the annotator feel judged—both answers mention the same controversial items.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are straightforward sentences. A is longer but still easy to read; B is extremely concise. No confusing language.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference: A provides several examples and extra detail (cannabis, registration, health updates) whereas B only lists two items. This gives the annotator clear grounds to pick based on completeness/accuracy, so differences are meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Little conflict—one response is simply more informative; no trade-off between, say, kindness and honesty.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate factual-knowledge consideration but otherwise straightforward; minimal social pressure or cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Ordinary people have at least hearsay knowledge about sleepwalking; no technical expertise is needed, though some may be unsure of medical accuracy.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only two brief statements; differences (dangerous vs. not dangerous) are obvious and quick to judge.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is medically oriented and not tied to politics, morality, or identity, so little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are short, vocabulary simple, and the contrasting claims are explicit.  
4.b 1  

5.a The responses diverge on a substantive point (dangerous vs. not), not merely wording. That makes preferences easy, though still only one point of contrast.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s just which statement seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Combining low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, neutral topic, clear wording, and a clear substantive difference, expressing a preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better only needs general common-sense or high-school-level health knowledge (or one quick web search). No deep medical expertise is essential.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two brief statements; comparing them for plausibility or completeness is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is medically oriented and apolitical. Little risk that social desirability or cultural bias will sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable and unambiguous. Response B is longer but still straightforward; no dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other about heart-attack risk, a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Selecting between them doesn’t pit honesty against kindness or other competing values—accuracy is the only obvious criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal effort, clear wording, and no value conflicts, expressing a preference is fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluating which answer is better mostly involves everyday notions about sleepwalking and spotting plausibility; no technical sleep-medicine expertise is really needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; differences are limited but easy to parse, so the mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and non-controversial; little risk that social desirability pressures the annotator.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and plain-language; minor wording quirks but nothing confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The content overlaps heavily—both warn of disorientation/aggression and debunk extreme harm myths; main distinction is tone (“hazardous” vs. “can be done safely”). Differences are somewhat superficial, making preference harder.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s a simple factual question.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear and the topic is simple, choosing isn’t hard, but the high similarity between answers reduces obvious preference cues, giving moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that Montreal isn’t the absolute snowiest city or notice that Response A doesn’t list any cities, while Response B does. No specialist meteorological knowledge required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: A quick read reveals that Response A fails to answer the prompt, whereas Response B supplies an explicit comparison. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Snowfall amounts are a neutral topic with no cultural or political sensitivity; biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to understand; there is no ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference is substantial—one response is incorrect/irrelevant, the other directly answers the question—making preference straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; accuracy and relevance both clearly favor one response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task involves minimal knowledge, effort, bias, or conflict—and the responses differ significantly in quality—expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Both answers deal with a common-sense topic (alcohol metabolism). No technical or specialized knowledge is needed to judge which wording one prefers.  
1.b 1

2.a Evaluating them mostly involves noticing that one answer is a short sentence and the other is a slightly longer explanation; little mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The subject is not politically or socially charged; there is little risk that bias or social desirability will sway the annotator.  
3.b 1

4.a Language is simple and direct in both responses; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantive content is essentially the same—both say you cannot sober up quickly. Differences are largely stylistic (brevity vs. detail), making it hard to see a meaningful distinction.  
5.b 4

6.a No competing values are at stake; honesty, safety, and completeness all align.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the two answers convey the same message, an annotator may find it moderately hard to pick a “better” one—choice rests on personal preference for brevity vs. elaboration rather than on clear quality differences.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Need to know basic facts about alcohol metabolism and whether water actually speeds sobering; not common everyday knowledge but not highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses to read and compare; limited analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Drinking culture beliefs may play a small role, but little societal pressure in choosing one answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are clear and easy to understand; no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One claims sobering speed can’t be changed, the other claims water helps; substantive disagreement.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Must weigh accuracy/honesty (Response A) against perceived practicality/helpfulness (Response B), creating some tension.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate difficulty mainly due to needing some health knowledge and a small accuracy-versus-helpfulness trade-off, but otherwise straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Evaluating which answer is better requires some familiarity with how alcohol is metabolized; many laypeople may have heard conflicting folk advice, so moderate knowledge is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a The comparison involves noting that one reply gives detailed but dubious claims while the other is terse but medically sound; this takes a bit of thought but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged, and there is little social pressure about which answer to favor.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are short and written plainly; nothing is syntactically confusing, though A’s numbers could mislead.  
4.b 2  

5.a The differences are substantial: A offers a concrete (though likely false) tactic, B states that no quick fix exists. These are clearly distinct approaches.  
5.b 1  

6.a The chooser might weigh helpfulness/detail (A) against accuracy/safety (B), a mild trade-off but not a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall, the decision is fairly straightforward: one answer is more likely correct but less elaborate, the other is elaborate but probably wrong; moderate knowledge suffices and bias is minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must only know common traffic laws (e.g., DUI is illegal everywhere) or recognize that “flip-flop driving” is not actually prohibited. This is basic civic knowledge, no technical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short statements; evaluating truthfulness and completeness is quick and simple.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little to no social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written. A is a bit longer but still straightforward. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give entirely different claims—one accurate, one likely false—so the distinction is significant.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge requirements, minimal cognitive load, no bias pressures, and clear, distinct answers, choosing according to true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people already know that drinking and driving is illegal; recognizing that the “must wear shoes” claim is false might take a quick common-sense check or a quick recall of basic traffic rules, but no specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short sentences to compare; deciding which is more accurate is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and unambiguous. No complex wording or hidden meanings.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give completely different claims (one true, one spurious), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, no bias, and clear distinctions, selecting a preferred response should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Determining which response is better hinges on knowing whether Texas actually bans driving in flip-flops—an obscure point of traffic law most people don’t know.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from that factual check, the responses are short and easy to compare; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is mundane and carries no political or social sensitivity, so bias or social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; Response A is longer but still straightforward. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantively they say the same thing; A merely adds a (likely fabricated) backstory. Differences are mostly stylistic, so choosing feels arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a question of which answer is preferred.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are nearly equivalent in claim yet require niche knowledge to judge accuracy, selecting a true preference is moderately hard but not extremely so.  
7.b 3
1.a Only very basic investment/common-sense knowledge is needed to judge which answer better fits the prompt (i.e., we only “know” the fund’s past record; future isn’t guaranteed).  
1.b 2  

2.a The annotator just has to read a short sentence vs. a short paragraph and decide which is more accurate/relevant; little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is financially factual, with no political or social-identity pressure; biases unlikely to influence choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are readable; A is wordier but not confusing, B is extremely terse. Comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ substantively: A makes strong claims about exceptional skill; B cautions that nothing is guaranteed. Clear distinction helps preference expression.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-off between competing moral or practical values; it’s mostly accuracy vs. verbosity, which isn’t a deep value conflict.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge needs, low cognitive load, clarity, and clear substantive difference, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Both answers use everyday language and rely on a very common‐sense notion of investment performance; no special finance expertise is needed to tell which reply better answers “what we know for sure.”  
1.b 1  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The replies are two short sentences each. An average reader can decide in seconds which one matches the prompt more closely.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
No hot-button social or political issues are touched. Little risk of social desirability bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both statements are brief, grammatically clear, and easy to parse; no hidden complexity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Response A states uncertainty (skill or luck) and directly addresses “what we know.” Response B gives an investment recommendation instead. That is a substantive difference, so preferences can be expressed easily.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing moral or pragmatic values are in tension; it’s simply a matter of which answer feels more accurate.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given the low knowledge need, minimal effort, no bias pressure, clear wording, and a noticeable content difference, it is very easy for most people to state their genuine preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is “better” hinges on familiarity with investment concepts like “survivorship bias” and whether past returns truly prove skill. An average person may not fully grasp that statistical idea but does understand “good performance,” so some—but not extensive—specialized knowledge is useful.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; weighing them mostly involves judging plausibility. Only modest thought is needed to compare “it’s obviously skill” vs. “maybe survivorship bias.”  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Financial performance is not a politically or culturally charged topic; little social desirability pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are written clearly and concisely; vocabulary is accessible except for the single term “survivorship bias,” but context suggests its meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite interpretations (skill vs. bias). These are substantive and easy to distinguish.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between moral or practical values are at stake—only which explanation one finds more convincing.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge demands but otherwise clear, unbiased, and meaningfully different, so expressing a true preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic financial literacy (the common disclaimer that “past performance does not guarantee future results”) is enough to judge which answer is more credible; no deep technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short; the main difference is obvious. Little mental effort is required to weigh them.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is neutral and lacks political or cultural sensitivity; minimal social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are intelligible; Response A is longer but not hard to parse. Misleading content in A is evident, yet clarity of wording remains high.  
4.b 2  

5.a They take opposite stances (guaranteed continuation vs. no guarantee). The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because minimal knowledge, effort, bias, or value conflict is involved and the contrast is stark, expressing a genuine preference is very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge is limited to common facts—most people know many animals play and that formal proof of theorems is uniquely human. No specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Both answers are one-sentence claims; assessing plausibility is quick and requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social desirability influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are short and unambiguous. Easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a They propose entirely different “uniquely human” abilities, so distinctions are substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, clear wording, and no value conflicts, expressing a genuine preference is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both statements rely on common-sense facts (animals don’t build spacecraft; they don’t use human-level spoken language). No specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Evaluating which answer feels better mainly involves deciding which cited ability seems more uniquely human or better supported; this is a quick, low-effort judgment.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; there is little cultural, political, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Each answer is short and comprehensible; Response B is longer but not complex. No ambiguity or jargon that obscures meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses name entirely different abilities, so the contrast is clear and substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are in play; it’s purely a factual/preference judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal knowledge and effort are required, with clear, unbiased, and distinct responses, so expressing a preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers revolve around the familiar claim that language is uniquely human; no technical expertise is required to judge which wording one prefers.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison mostly involves weighing brevity (A) versus detail (B). That is quick and low-effort, though one must read B’s longer paragraph.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial and unlikely to trigger social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are clear; B is lengthier but not hard to parse. No ambiguity or misleading content.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is essentially the same—only style and depth differ—so distinguishing on preference feels minor.  
5.b 4  

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice is mainly between concise vs. detailed exposition, a mild stylistic trade-off, not a clash of core values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the substantive difference is small, picking a “better” answer may feel arbitrary, but the task still isn’t taxing.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or suspect) the well-known myth that “science says bumblebees can’t fly” is false and that aerodynamic research actually explains their flight. This is moderately specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparing them mainly involves judging factual accuracy, which is a quick task for most people, though it may require a moment’s reflection.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-political and non-controversial; little to no social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are grammatical and easily understood; there is no heavy jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are substantively different—one claims proven flight, the other claims flight is impossible—so preferences are easy to differentiate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, the comparison is straightforward with minimal cognitive load or bias concerns.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only general awareness that bumblebee flight is often discussed in popular science; deep aerodynamic expertise is not required to see A is fuller than B, though some technical accuracy questions could arise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a detailed paragraph to a single-sentence answer is quick; little mental effort beyond noting depth and plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and non-sensitive; no cultural or moral pressure likely.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are easy to read; A is longer but straightforward, B is extremely brief, so comparison is clear.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially in depth, specificity, and informativeness; easy to see distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor possibility of choosing between brevity and thoroughness/possible inaccuracy, but stakes are low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge, cognitive, and social hurdles and clear differences, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which reply is better hinges on knowing whether the popular “bee shouldn’t be able to fly” story is actually false. An average person might not know that, but they could still judge based on completeness. Some technical knowledge helps but isn’t strictly necessary.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is a single sentence, the other a short paragraph. Comparing them takes little time; no deep analysis or outside lookup is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral overtones are involved. Little risk of outside pressure affecting the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both texts are readable. Response A uses a bit of jargon (“localized area of turbulent airflow”) but remains understandable; Response B is extremely simple. No major ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ strongly in depth and informativeness—one is detailed (though partially dubious), the other trivial. The contrast is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between wanting detail (A) and wanting brevity or strict accuracy (B). Not a profound conflict for most people.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low bias, modest knowledge needs, and clear differences, expressing a preference should be fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic understanding of what makes an answer “scientific” is enough; deep aerodynamics expertise isn’t needed, though it would help judge technical accuracy.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is very short, the other much longer; comparing usefulness and substance is quick and intuitive for most readers.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and non-controversial; little to no external pressure influences preference.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are readable; Response B is longer but still plain language. No jargon that obscures meaning.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ greatly in depth and informativeness, giving annotators a clear basis for choice.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-offs; it’s largely a matter of preferring brevity vs. detail, not competing ethical values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low; distinctions are clear, topic is neutral, and required knowledge modest.  
7.b 2
1.a Distinguishing which answer is more accurate or helpful requires some understanding of U.S. defamation law; an average person may not know that simply saying “in my opinion” is not a full shield.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, so comparison doesn’t demand much reading or analysis time, though deciding which is correct still involves some thought.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is largely legal/technical, not politically or culturally charged, so little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are very brief and written plainly, making them easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a The two answers convey virtually the same oversimplified idea; differences are mostly phrasing and length, not substance.  
5.b 4

6.a No obvious trade-off between competing values is required; it’s simply a question of which is better.  
6.b 1

7.a Because meaningful differences are small and legal expertise is needed to judge quality, an annotator may struggle to state a confident preference, though overall cognitive load is low.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic awareness of what defamation is is enough; no specialized legal expertise needed to see that B provides more detail than A.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a brief read-through and comparison (one sentence vs. a short paragraph). Minimal analysis required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is legal, not politically charged; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward; B is longer but still clear and not technical.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is very bare-bones; B offers a concrete tactic and cites a case. The difference is substantive and easily perceived.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice doesn’t pit major competing values against each other—just brevity vs. completeness, a minor trade-off.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering low knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, minimal bias, and clear meaningful differences, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluating which answer is better may benefit from some familiarity with U.S. defamation law to spot oversimplifications, but a layperson can still judge that a one-sentence answer is probably weaker than a fuller explanation.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two short responses; comparing them does not require much reading or analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged, so personal or social biases are unlikely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear; neither is jargon-heavy. Response B is longer but still easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One reply is extremely brief and generic while the other gives a concrete tactic and some legal reasoning, so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved; it’s simply about which answer seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal bias, low cognitive load, and clear substantive differences make it easy for an annotator to express a genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing real per-capita beef-consumption data, something most people don’t carry around. No specialized “expert” knowledge is needed, but it’s beyond everyday facts.  
1.b 3

2.a The two replies are short; the only task is to judge which statement matches reality. There’s little to parse or dissect, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Beef-consumption statistics are not politically or culturally charged for most readers, so social pressure or bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are clear and grammatically simple. Response B has some hype but is easy to understand. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a They make opposite factual claims, so the difference is stark and substantive, making preference selection straightforward once one knows the facts.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a The main difficulty is factual knowledge; otherwise the choice is easy. Overall, it’s moderately easy but not trivial for someone unfamiliar with beef-consumption data.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is correct hinges on knowing (or checking) actual international beef-consumption statistics—information most laypeople don’t have readily available.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The texts are short, but an annotator may feel the need to verify data to judge accuracy, adding some mental work beyond a quick read.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Beef-consumption rankings carry little ideological or cultural baggage; few external pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear; Response B is wordier yet still understandable. No tricky wording or jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite factual claims, offering a stark, substantive contrast—choosing between them is consequential, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision is essentially about factual correctness; no competing ethical or stylistic values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the answers are easy to read and clearly different, lack of readily available knowledge makes it moderately challenging for an average person to know which is better.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or look up) comparative per-capita beef-consumption data and which nations count as “developed.” This is not common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory; deciding which is better mainly involves checking a single factual point. Minimal mental effort once the fact is known.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial; little political, cultural, or moral pressure is involved, aside from mild national pride.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief, grammatical, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims, so the difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some moderately specific knowledge, the comparison is straightforward with clear, substantive differences and no social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic common-sense knowledge (e.g., “surely not 100 % of Canadians are straight”) is needed to reject Response A and prefer Response B.  
1.b 1

2.a Little mental effort: one response is blatantly false, the other simply admits the data are unspecified.  
2.b 1

3.a While sexual orientation is a socially sensitive topic, the choice here doesn’t force the annotator to reveal personal views—just to spot an obvious falsehood—so social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Both replies are short and easy to understand; no ambiguity or technical language.  
4.b 1

5.a The difference is substantial: an extreme, factually wrong claim vs. a cautious, non-committal statement.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; accuracy and neutrality align in the same response.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge requirement, minimal bias pressure, clear contrast, and lack of value conflict, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a To know which figure is closer to reality, one would need familiarity with Canadian survey data or be willing to look it up; most people lack that specific knowledge.  
1.b 4  

2.a Evaluating which response is better mainly involves checking cited sources or spotting possible fabrication; that takes some, but not extreme, mental effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a While sexual-orientation statistics can be politically sensitive, the task here is simply to judge factual accuracy—social pressure is limited.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both answers are concise, use everyday language, and cite purported sources; they’re easy to read and line-up side-by-side.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ meaningfully in the key statistic (95.5 % vs 85 %) and in the specificity of their citations, so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 2  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are present; it’s a straightforward factual comparison.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because accuracy hinges on specialized knowledge yet other factors are simple, the overall difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person likely knows that the vast majority of Canadians are heterosexual and can see that Response B provides concrete numbers while Response A is vague; no expert statistics are needed to tell which seems more informative.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a brief comparison of a one-sentence answer versus a short paragraph with numbers; minimal reading or analysis required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although sexual orientation is a sensitive topic, both answers are factual and non-judgmental, so social desirability should not strongly influence the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; there is no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is merely generic, the other gives specific statistics and cites sources—clearly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved; accuracy and completeness both favor the same response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering the low knowledge requirement, minimal cognitive effort, little social pressure, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, expressing a preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator needs only general awareness that LGBTQ+ prevalence in Canada is several percent, not 0.6 %, to see A is dubious and B is non-committal; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are very short; judging them mainly involves noticing that A gives a precise (likely wrong) figure and B gives none. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sexual-orientation statistics can evoke social/political sensitivities, and A’s wording about “traditional family values” could trigger reactions. Still, deciding which answer is better is not heavily constrained by social desirability.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; A is explicit, B is terse but understandable. No complex jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response provides a specific claim and explanation; the other admits ignorance. The contrast is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Only minor trade-off (accuracy vs. completeness/helpfulness). No deep clash of core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With moderate knowledge needs and low cognitive load, but some social sensitivity, choosing is relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers deal with everyday facts about coffee consumption; no specialized expertise is needed to judge which answer seems more informative or useful.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is simple—Response A is longer with numbers and a reason, Response B is a short statement. Deciding which you like better requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (coffee habits in India vs. Mexico) is non-controversial; no political or cultural pressure likely influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read. There is no ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is the amount of detail; both give the same factual claim. That difference is noticeable but not profound.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not pit important values against each other; accuracy and helpfulness align.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With minimal knowledge needed, low cognitive load, and clear, neutral answers, selecting a preferred response is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer only needs a rough idea that Europeans are heavy coffee drinkers while China is not; this is fairly common knowledge and not specialized.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator mainly has to notice that A makes a doubtful claim and that B is short but plausible; little analysis is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Coffee consumption is not a sensitive or polarizing topic, so personal or social biases are minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; A is wordy but coherent, B is very concise. No technical jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially—A offers an elaborate but incorrect comparison, B gives a concise, likely correct location—so the choice is meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: There is no trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the clear deciding factor.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all low, most annotators can easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of country-level coffee-consumption statistics is needed to judge which statement is correct; that information is not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Aside from checking the single fact, the responses are short and easy to compare; little mental work is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Coffee consumption is a neutral subject with no obvious cultural or political pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are clear and concise; wording is straightforward, though A is slightly longer. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ markedly in both content (different country named) and factual correctness, giving the annotator a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the only potential hurdle is knowing (or quickly checking) the factual data, expressing a true preference is fairly easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of actual international firearm-ownership statistics is needed to judge which answer is more accurate. Most people do not know per-capita gun numbers for Australia, the U.S., Ireland, etc., so specialized (though not highly technical) knowledge is required.  
1.b 3

2.a Aside from the facts, comparing the answers is simple: A is long and data-heavy, B is one sentence. Little mental computation is needed beyond deciding whether one trusts the numbers, so cognitive load is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Guns and national comparisons can evoke political opinions; however, the question is factual and does not ask for moral judgment. Some ideological bias could creep in, but pressure is limited.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are readable. Response A is longer but coherent; Response B is extremely brief. Neither is syntactically confusing, though A’s confidently presented but dubious figures could mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are substantial: A gives a list of countries (though likely wrong); B gives a single country and little else. They represent clearly different approaches (detail vs. brevity).  
5.b 2

6.a The choice entails a trade-off between completeness and likely accuracy: A tries to be thorough but seems incorrect; B is probably correct but minimal. That creates a mild value conflict (thoroughness vs. reliability).  
6.b 3

7.a Because some background knowledge is needed and there’s a mild political context plus a trade-off between accuracy and detail, selecting the preferred answer is moderately difficult but not severe.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is better hinges on knowing actual gun-ownership statistics for Australia, France, and the United States. Many people know the U.S. has more guns than Australia, but far fewer know how France compares, so some outside knowledge (or checking a source) is useful.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The replies are each one sentence long; comparing them is quick. The only mental work is recalling (or guessing) which statement is factually correct.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The topic (guns) can be politically sensitive, but here the task is purely factual—no moral stance is requested—so social desirability pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are grammatically clear and easy to read; there’s no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They name completely different countries and give opposite implications about U.S. gun levels. The differences are substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-off between competing values is required; the annotator just decides which factual claim seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the task boils down to knowing (or looking up) simple statistics, and the replies are brief and clear, most annotators can express a preference without much difficulty, though limited knowledge about France vs. Australia adds some modest challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person probably knows the U.S. has far more guns than Australia, so spotting Response A as implausible doesn’t demand specialist knowledge; no deep statistics needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; deciding mainly involves checking plausibility and completeness—little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although gun topics can be political, simply choosing which factual answer is better isn’t likely to trigger strong social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward English; no jargon. Numbers in A are easy to read; B is one simple sentence.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A is detailed but incorrect; B is concise and likely correct yet incomplete. The substantive difference (accuracy vs. inaccuracy) is clear.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight tension between valuing thoroughness (A) and accuracy (B), but accuracy generally dominates; conflict is mild.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, mild bias, clear statements, and obvious accuracy issues, choosing is fairly easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You only need basic, widely-known facts (e.g., that the U.S. has very high gun ownership) to see that Response B is wrong and Response A is plausible, though incomplete.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; checking which is more accurate or acceptable takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Gun policy can be politicized, but here the task is simply correctness; most people won’t feel heavy social pressure picking the factually better answer.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; numbers and claims are explicit, with no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is partially correct but minimal; the other is clearly erroneous. The difference is substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between completeness (Response A lists only one country) and factual accuracy, but accuracy dominates; no major value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge/cognitive demands, clear differences, and minimal value conflict, most annotators can easily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is better hinges on knowing U.S. law-enforcement practice; an annotator who doesn’t know whether the “Identification Mandate” exists may find the two statements equally plausible. Some legal knowledge or prior debunking of the common myth is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Both answers are short and make a single, directly conflicting claim. Once the annotator decides which claim is correct, comparison is straightforward; little additional analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The topic isn’t especially political or socially sensitive; most people won’t feel pressured to favor one response for ideological reasons.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are clearly written, concise, and easy to parse, though Response A invents terminology (“Identification Mandate”). The wording itself is not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The responses give opposite answers (must disclose vs. may legally lie). The difference is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-off between competing moral values is required; the issue is simple factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the main challenge is knowing the true legal situation, the task is only moderately hard; otherwise it is simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which reply is better, a rater would need to know (or look up) the real history of fortune cookies. Most people falsely believe they’re Chinese-American; even fewer know the California/Japanese-immigrant origin story. Distinguishing accuracy therefore demands fairly specialized factual knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The texts are short, but if the rater tries to verify accuracy, they must reason, recall, or research. Without that step, the choice is easy; with it, effort rises to moderate.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is culturally neutral and carries little political or social weight, so biases or desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively they say the same thing (Kyoto origin). Differences are mainly length and embellishment, not content, making it harder to prefer one on meaningful grounds.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only mild trade-off (concise vs. descriptive storytelling). No major conflict of honesty vs. kindness, safety vs. helpfulness, etc.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because accuracy is hard to gauge and the content differences are slight, an annotator may struggle moderately to state a clear preference, but low bias and high clarity keep the task from being very hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is better, one would need to recognize that fortune cookies are generally accepted to have originated in the United States (with Japanese-American roots). That is not common “headline” knowledge but it isn’t highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator must read a short statement vs. a longer narrative and decide which is preferable, accounting for possible misinformation. Some thought is needed but no deep analysis or outside resources.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial; little likelihood of political or cultural pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written and easy to parse. There’s no jargon or ambiguity, though Response A is longer.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ in length and elaboration, but substantively they both give the same (incorrect) claim. Differences are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs such as honesty vs. politeness; both are simply factual responses.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers share the same factual error and differ mainly in verbosity, it can be hard to express a clear preference without specialist knowledge. However, low social pressure and easy readability keep difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know or quickly verify the generally accepted history of fortune cookies (California/Japanese-American origin) to see that Response A is likely wrong and Response B is closer to consensus. This is somewhat beyond common trivia but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison involves judging factual accuracy versus amount of detail; only two short answers, limited nuance. Moderate effort, but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is culturally neutral; little risk of political or social desirability bias influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording in both answers is plain. Response A is longer but still readable; no jargon or heavy ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantial difference—one provides elaborate (but incorrect) Chinese origin story, the other a brief but commonly accepted California origin. Easy to perceive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor trade-off between thoroughness (A) and factual accuracy (B). Not a deep ethical conflict but could cause hesitation.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate factual knowledge and minor weighing of detail versus accuracy, but no strong biases or complexities.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic cultural knowledge or a quick intuition that fortune cookies are considered an American/Chinese-American item; no specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are one-sentence and directly contradictory, so comparison is quick and effortless.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-sensitive; no political or social stakes likely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short, unambiguous, and easy to understand.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give completely different origins (California vs. Kyoto), so the difference is substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness are involved; simply selecting which seems correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge barrier, clear contradiction, and no social pressures, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a An annotator must know (or research) the factual history of Bill Gates’ high-school performance; this isn’t everyday knowledge but it isn’t highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short, but because they contradict each other the annotator must judge reliability, maybe cross-check facts, which adds some mental effort beyond a quick skim.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is non-sensitive and carries little ideological or social pressure; most people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is straightforward, though Response A has a small grammatical hiccup; overall both are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are substantive (one says Gates struggled, the other says he excelled), giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s simply a question of factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some background knowledge or quick fact-checking, the choice is simple and low-stakes, so overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person doesn’t need deep, specialized knowledge. While Response B lists concrete facts (e.g., National Merit Scholarship, 3.8 GPA), one can still judge helpfulness/quality without knowing whether every detail is correct.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only a brief read-through and basic comparison of specificity vs. vagueness is needed; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-controversial; no obvious political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and written plainly. Response B is longer but still straightforward; no ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive distinction—Response A is generic, Response B provides specific details—so preferences can be expressed easily.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty). One simply chooses between brevity and detail.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining the low knowledge demands, straightforward comparison, and lack of bias or value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which response is more accurate requires some familiarity with Bill Gates’s schooling; that information isn’t universal trivia but also isn’t highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses are short; comparison mostly involves judging plausibility and detail, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is non-controversial; little to no political, cultural, or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Wording is straightforward; Response A is longer but still clear. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers give opposite factual claims (disengaged vs. excelled), so the difference is substantial and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are present; it’s simply about which seems better/ more correct.  
6.b 1  

7.a Except for needing some factual knowledge, the task is simple: clear, distinct answers, low bias, low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness about what constitutes a good answer is needed; no specialized facts about Bill Gates are required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is mainly about length and specificity, so very little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is non-controversial; social or cultural biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and straightforward; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response offers an extra detail (SAT score) and fuller wording, but overall substance is similar; the difference is modest but still noticeable.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear text, and minor but clear differences, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing the correct response hinges on knowing the actual content of Australia’s Marriage Act 1961. Most people are unlikely to have that fact at hand, so some legal-specific knowledge or quick research is needed.  
1.b 4

2.a The answers are short, but to decide which is better the annotator must verify the law or trust their memory, so a modest amount of effort (possibly a lookup) is required.  
2.b 3

3.a Marrying cousins can evoke moral or cultural disapproval; an annotator who feels it “ought” to be illegal might be inclined toward the incorrect answer, so moderate social bias could interfere.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are clearly written, brief, and easy to parse; there is little ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 1

5.a The differences are stark and substantive (one says “prohibited,” the other “legal”). They are not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a There is little trade-off between competing values; the main issue is factual accuracy vs. personal discomfort, a relatively mild conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a While the responses are clear and meaningfully different, the need for specific legal knowledge and possible moral bias add some difficulty, but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct, the annotator would need to know or look up the actual content of Australia’s Marriage Act 1961—information that most people do not possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from accuracy checking, the structure and length of the replies are simple, so only a moderate effort (quick fact-check) is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although cousin marriage can evoke moral opinions, the question is strictly about legal facts; social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, grammatical, and unambiguous; no jargon or complex reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other on a key point (legal vs. illegal), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision is mainly about factual accuracy; no trade-off between competing ethical or stylistic values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are clear and differ meaningfully, but selecting the better one requires specific legal knowledge, expressing a true preference is moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To realize that both answers are factually wrong, an annotator would need to know—or look up—Australia’s marriage law, which is not common knowledge for most people.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from the legal-accuracy check, comparing length and tone is easy; no complex reasoning steps are needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject is not highly politicized or culturally sensitive for most readers, so personal or social bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are concise, unambiguous, and written in plain language.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, the answers say the same thing; the only difference is that B is longer and cites the Act. Distinction is mostly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s a straightforward factual question.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are nearly identical in content yet both inaccurate, an annotator without specialized knowledge may have trouble deciding which is “better,” making preference selection moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is correct, a rater needs some familiarity with the current state of French censorship. Most people won’t know whether “Ulysses” or “Naked Lunch” are still banned, so specialized or at least uncommon knowledge is needed.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from the knowledge gap, comparing a one-sentence answer to a detailed but possibly wrong answer is not mentally taxing; it’s a quick read.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or morally charged for most raters; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are written plainly. Response A is terse but clear; Response B is longer yet easy to follow. No convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a stark difference—one is minimal and the other specific—so the contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The rater must weigh completeness/detail (B) against likely factual accuracy (A’s caution vs. B’s confident, possibly false claims). This creates a modest trade-off between informativeness and reliability.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because accuracy hinges on specialized knowledge yet the comparison itself is simple and bias is low, expressing a true preference is only moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of French censorship history could help but is not strictly needed because both answers are vague; still, verifying accuracy would require some specialized knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Responses are extremely short; comparing them takes little effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Topic is not highly sensitive; little social or political pressure in choosing either answer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are simple and unambiguous, though they lack detail.  
4.b 2  

5.a The two answers convey almost the same idea with only a slight nuance (“only a few” vs. “certain … indicating ongoing censorship”); substantive differences are minimal.  
5.b 4  

6.a No evident trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the responses are clear but nearly identical in content, deciding a meaningful preference is somewhat difficult, though not extremely so.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is only basic awareness of European currencies (Euro vs. Swiss franc), which many people possess or can infer easily.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating which answer is more accurate takes minimal mental effort—just check if Switzerland uses the euro or the franc.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is neutral; no cultural or political pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short and plain-language; any ambiguity in Response B is still easy to spot.  
4.b 2

5.a There is a real substantive difference: Response A omits francs for Switzerland, while Response B at least mentions both euros and francs, making correctness the key differentiator.  
5.b 2

6.a No conflicting values (e.g., politeness vs. accuracy) are involved—only factual accuracy matters.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge and cognitive demands, lack of bias, clear wording, and meaningful but simple difference, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of the Euro is very common; knowing that Switzerland keeps the Swiss franc is moderately common but not specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a One just has to check which answer gets Switzerland right; this is a quick factual comparison with little mental load.  
2.b 2

3.a Currency choice is not politically or socially charged, so biases rarely influence the decision.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The key difference—whether Switzerland uses the Euro or the franc—is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-off of competing values is involved; it’s purely factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a With minimal knowledge and effort, an annotator can confidently prefer the accurate response, so overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires knowing that Switzerland uses the Swiss franc, not the euro; that’s general geographic knowledge, not specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluator just checks currency accuracy and perhaps prefers brevity vs. verbosity; little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no social or cultural pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are grammatically clear; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantive difference is minimal—both give the same (incorrect) content; only style/length differs, so distinguishing on merit is hard.  
5.b 4

6.a Only slight trade-off between conciseness (A) and extra background (B); no serious value clash.  
6.b 2

7.a Because both responses are equally wrong and otherwise similar, picking a “better” one is somewhat tricky but not onerous.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   – Must know or quickly verify that Switzerland uses the Swiss franc, not the euro. This is common travel‐related knowledge, not specialized.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   – Comparison involves a single factual check; little mental effort or analysis needed.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   – Currency choice is neutral; no political or cultural pressure influences the decision.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   – Both answers are short and readable. Minor extra detail in A doesn’t hinder understanding.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   – Response A lists Swiss francs; Response B says euro for Switzerland. This substantive correctness gap makes preference straightforward.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   – No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s a simple accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   – With minimal knowledge and effort, one can see A is more accurate, so expressing a true preference is easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better may hinge on knowing—at least roughly—whether food has become more or less affordable in Canada. That factual knowledge isn’t common trivia and might require familiarity with economic data or news reports.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; the annotator mostly weighs a vague claim (A) against a detailed claim (B). Little analytic effort is needed beyond noting detail vs. lack of detail.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Food affordability is not highly politicized for most people, so personal or social biases play a small role.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are clear English. Response A is terse but understandable; Response B is longer but still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other and differ in specificity, giving the annotator a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There is minimal conflict—no trade-off between kindness, safety, etc. Perhaps brevity (A) vs. detail (B), but that’s minor.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing some background knowledge to judge factual accuracy, the choice is simple; other factors pose little challenge.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would need at least a rough idea of how food affordability has actually trended in Canada or be able to sense which response seems more evidence-based. That information isn’t common trivia but also isn’t highly technical; moderate outside knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are very short; comparing them takes little time. The only effort is deciding which claim is more plausible or supported.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild political overtones in Response A (corporate consolidation critique) could align with or rub against someone’s ideology, but social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response A supplies numbers (though unverifiable) and an explanation; Response B is a single sentence. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (affordability worsened vs. improved) and differ in detail vs. brevity—clear, substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; it is simply about which factual claim seems better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are short, clear, and distinctly different, and because biases and needed knowledge are moderate, most people could readily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To decide which answer better reflects reality, an annotator would need at least some familiarity with historical Canadian food-price data or be willing to look it up; otherwise, they must guess or judge on presentation alone.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so reading effort is light, and the main comparison is straightforward. Only modest reasoning is needed beyond basic reading.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Food-price history is not politically or culturally contentious for most people, so there is little social pressure or ideological bias involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically clear; Response B is longer but still easy to follow. No dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (improved vs. worsened affordability) and differ in depth, so the contrast is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The annotator might have to weigh brevity/trustworthiness (A) against apparent evidence/detail (B), creating a mild conflict between valuing conciseness versus sourced claims and potential accuracy.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the contradiction is clear and the language is simple, determining which response to prefer hinges on factual accuracy that many annotators won’t readily know, producing a moderate overall difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is correct entails knowing Dutch censorship law or at least having heard whether any films remain banned there—an obscure topic for most people.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from the factual check, the responses are short; comparison is easy, but the annotator may need to reason about plausibility or look it up.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little to no political or cultural pressure; the topic is not sensitive.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to understand; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other (none banned vs. Cannibal Holocaust banned), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no competing ethical or stylistic values involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing specialized factual knowledge, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, clear difference) makes selection straightforward. Difficulty is moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An evaluator would need to know (or look up) whether any film is still banned in the Netherlands; this isn’t common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; deciding mostly hinges on which seems factually accurate, so the mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Film-censorship opinions are not especially charged in most societies; little social-desirability pressure here.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short, direct, and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One claims a specific ongoing ban; the other says essentially no bans. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are required—just pick the answer believed to be correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some non-common factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; minimal bias and clear differences keep difficulty low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some specific knowledge about Dutch film censorship history to know which statement is correct; not common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only a short prompt and two brief answers; comparison is quick once one decides which seems accurate.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is not politically or socially charged; little bias or pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are simple and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a One answer says “none outlawed,” the other cites a specific continuing ban; the difference is substantial.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing values are at stake—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Main challenge is the factual knowledge required; otherwise the choice is straightforward, so overall difficulty is moderate-low.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate you need some familiarity with how modern lithium-ion batteries and charge controllers work. An average person may be unsure whether “overcharge cascading” is real or whether phones stop charging automatically. This is moderately specialized but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The user only has to compare two short statements, one brief and one slightly longer. Little analysis is needed beyond deciding which seems believable.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is technical and apolitical; there is no cultural or social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response B uses some heavy jargon that could confuse readers, but the basic message (“it will destroy your battery”) is still clear.  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: The positions are starkly different (no harm vs. rapid destruction), so the difference is substantive and easy to perceive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or personal values are in play—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate technical knowledge and coping with Response B’s jargon, the decision is straightforward; other complicating factors are minimal.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on understanding how lithium-ion charging really works; average users may not know whether “trickle charging damages the battery” is accurate.  
1.b 3

2.a Responses are short, so reading effort is low, but deciding which is correct requires some reasoning or external checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is technical, not political or moral; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plain-language; no jargon. However, B’s technical tone could mislead, but still readable.  
4.b 2

5.a The two answers differ greatly (minimal vs. detailed claim of damage), so the contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Small trade-off between valuing completeness and valuing accuracy, but not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the main difficulty lies in knowing the factual accuracy, and other factors are easy, overall selection is of moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing (or suspecting) how modern lithium-ion charging circuits work. Many laypeople have heard that phones “stop charging at 100%,” but not everyone is confident; the term “trickle charging” may be unfamiliar, and “overcharge cascading” sounds scientific. Some technical literacy helps.
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to weigh, but the user must judge plausibility versus technical-sounding but possibly false claims. This is a moderate, not heavy, mental load.
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely technical, with no cultural or political stakes, so bias or social desirability plays almost no role.
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; Response A is a bit more jargon-heavy and sensational, yet still intelligible. Comparison is fairly direct.
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite explanations—automatic cutoff vs. catastrophic damage—so differences are substantive and easy to spot.
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply which explanation is correct.
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate technical knowledge and some plausibility assessment are required, but low social pressure and clear differences keep the task fairly easy.
7.b 2
1.a Basic civics knowledge or familiarity with U.S. flag etiquette helps, but no deep or technical expertise is needed to see that “misfortune” is superstition while “nothing happens” is straightforward.  
1.b 2

2.a Only two very short sentences to read and compare; little mental work required.  
2.b 1

3.a Patriotic feelings could nudge someone toward a more etiquette-focused answer, but the offered choices are not overtly political or controversial, so pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are extremely brief and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give opposite claims—superstitious harm vs. no effect—so the difference is clear and substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the clear, simple, and distinct replies, most people can easily state their preference; minor knowledge/bias factors keep it from being the absolute minimum difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which response is more accurate, one would need some familiarity with the U.S. Flag Code and the fact that it is advisory rather than legally enforceable. That knowledge is somewhat specialized, though many Americans have heard at least vaguely about the “sunrise-to-sunset unless illuminated” rule.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory; deciding between them mostly involves judging factual accuracy, which is quick for someone who knows the fact or can look it up.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject (flag etiquette) touches on patriotism but is not especially polarizing; little social pressure should interfere with picking the more accurate reply.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and easy to read. There is no jargon or ambiguity, just a clear factual claim in each.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference is stark—one says it’s a punishable offense, the other says nothing happens—so the annotator’s choice is meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a question of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some domain knowledge is useful, but otherwise the comparison is straightforward, with minimal cognitive load and little bias pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to know (or approximate) relative seafood-consumption figures. Many people lack that specific fact, but it isn’t highly technical; a quick common-sense check or memory of headlines suffices.  
1.b 3

2.a One has to judge which statement is accurate; that involves a single factual comparison, little reading, and no deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little chance of social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are plainly worded, but B supplies confident yet possibly misleading numbers, which may create some ambiguity for an uninformed reader.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially (one short, plausible fact vs. a long, contradictory claim). The difference is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No real value trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, choosing is fairly easy for anyone with minimal knowledge or willingness to fact-check; only modest uncertainty arises if one wholly lacks the relevant fact.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers name the same country; an annotator doesn’t need to know fisheries statistics to tell which reply they prefer—accuracy is assumed equal.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Deciding mainly involves weighting “detailed-with-numbers” versus “very brief.” Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Seafood consumption and developed countries are neutral topics; little ideological or social pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are simple and readable; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer supplies figures and context, the other is a single sentence. Difference is mostly depth/length, not content, so moderately small but still noticeable.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight trade-off between thoroughness and conciseness, but no significant ethical or safety tension.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal bias, and clear though modest differences, expressing a preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Picking a preferred answer doesn’t demand specialized knowledge; both responses plainly name Hong Kong and any layperson can judge the added statistic without expert background.  
1.b 2

2.a The reader only has to decide whether they like the succinct answer or the more detailed one; no deep analysis is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Seafood consumption is a neutral topic with little ideological or social-pressure baggage, so bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple, grammar is clear, and the numeric claim in Response B is easy to parse; comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 1

5.a While both give the same country, Response B supplies context and a figure, so the difference is mainly depth vs. brevity—somewhat meaningful but not dramatic.  
5.b 3

6.a The only mild trade-off is brevity versus thoroughness, which is not a serious value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Given the low knowledge requirement, minimal bias, clear wording, and only moderate difference in detail, most people will find it easy to state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs a basic sense of which nations are considered “developed” and some idea (or a quick Google check) of seafood-consumption statistics. This is general world-facts knowledge, not highly technical.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; deciding hinges on a couple of factual points. Little analytical effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (seafood consumption and development status) is neutral; no political or moral pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read. No jargon or confusing phrasing.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers name completely different countries and differ in depth (one gives numbers and context, the other is terse). The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a matter of accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear text, and no value or bias complications, an annotator should find it straightforward to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs general awareness that rhino horn has no proven medical benefit; this is common from media/conservation messaging, not deep technical expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short answers; differences (claim of efficacy vs. no efficacy) can be spotted almost immediately without extra research.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some social pressure to reject wildlife-trade products could steer choices, but that aligns with factual accuracy; influence is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Language is plain and direct in both replies; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One states “documented efficacy,” the other explicitly denies scientific support—substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs; accuracy and ethical stance coincide in one answer, so no difficult value juggling.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, most people can easily express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people know or have heard that rhino horn has no proven medical benefit; only basic awareness of modern medicine and conservation is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is a brief denial, the other gives a detailed but unsubstantiated claim; comparing them and spotting the likely correct one takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mainstream social norms condemn wildlife‐product remedies, so there is little pressure to endorse Response A; some cultural pride could create minor tension, but not major for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short and easy to read; there’s no technical jargon. Response A could mislead, but it is still clear in meaning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed—A says “yes,” B says “no.” The contrast is stark, enabling straightforward preference expression.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mostly a choice between factual accuracy and possible cultural deference; for most people this is not a serious dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive effort, clear statements, and an obvious factual distinction, deciding is easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person only needs basic science/common media knowledge (that rhino horn has no proven medical effect) to see which answer is accurate.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and directly contradictory; deciding which aligns with one’s preference for factual correctness is quick.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: There is mild social pressure toward wildlife conservation and against pseudoscientific claims, but it is unlikely to inhibit expressing true preference.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are clearly written; A is misleading but not ambiguous, B is straightforward, so comparison is easy.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ fundamentally—A claims efficacy, B denies any; the distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; accuracy and ethical considerations point the same way, with little trade-off between competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is clear, differences are stark, and little special knowledge or value trade-off is involved, choosing is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Both answers state that powdered rhino horn cures nothing; no specialized medical or wildlife-trade knowledge is needed to see this.  
1.b 1

2.a The evaluator just has to read a short and a long version of the same claim; mental effort is minimal.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic could touch on traditional-medicine beliefs, but for most people there’s little social pressure; bias impact is low to moderate.  
3.b 2

4.a Sentences are simple, vocabulary is common, no ambiguity; easy to understand and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantive content is the same; only length/detail differs, so distinguishing based on preference is hard.  
5.b 5

6.a Only slight trade-off between brevity (efficiency) and thoroughness; not a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the two responses convey identical information, choosing “better” is mainly about style, making preference expression somewhat arbitrary but not stressful.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know that both answers are factually incorrect (true etymology is uncertain but certainly not “founders”) one needs some niche historical-linguistic knowledge. Without that, an average person might believe either answer, making selection harder.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short. Aside from checking external references, comparing them is quick; little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly taboo (a swear word) but carries little political or cultural baggage; most people won’t fear judgment for preferring one answer.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are grammatically simple and easy to follow; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One says “no origin,” the other gives a concrete (though wrong) story. That is a substantive difference in content and style, so preferences can be expressed.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: The main tension is between brevity/error vs. detail/error; this is a mild trade-off, not a clash of core values like safety vs. freedom.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because correct evaluation hinges on specialized etymological knowledge, yet other dimensions (clarity, bias) are easy, the task is moderately challenging but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct you need some real etymological knowledge or at least awareness that the “Fornication Under Consent of the King” story is an urban legend. Many people do not know that, so some specialized knowledge is involved.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short; comparing them takes little time. The only effort is deciding whether the detailed but possibly false story is better than the very terse statement.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (a swear word’s origin) is not politically or socially charged for most people; little pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read and unambiguous in their claims; nothing is convoluted.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer outright asserts “no defined meaning,” the other gives a concrete (but incorrect) backronym. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotators might weigh thoroughness/entertainment (Response B) against accuracy/skepticism (Response A). That is a mild trade-off between helpfulness-detail and truthfulness.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some specific knowledge and a small trade-off between detail and accuracy, picking a preferred reply is fairly straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is better, the annotator needs to know (or look up) the real etymology of the f-word and that the “Fornication Under Consent of the King” story is an urban legend. Many people won’t already know this, but it isn’t extremely arcane scholarship either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, yet deciding entails checking factual accuracy, not just style. That requires a bit of investigation or prior knowledge, but it’s not a deep analytical task.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Swear-word etymology involves little political or cultural pressure; most people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read and unambiguous. No convoluted prose.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a real difference—one is detailed and confidently asserts a specific story; the other is extremely terse and vague. So the annotator has substantive aspects to compare.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits “thorough but likely incorrect” against “concise but also incorrect/empty,” creating a mild accuracy-vs-completeness trade-off, but not a profound moral dilemma.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—some factual knowledge is needed, and there’s a mild trade-off, but low social pressure and clear texts keep the task manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know basic facts about elephant behavior (they can be wary/aggressive in the wild yet sometimes bond in captivity). This is common nature-documentary knowledge; no technical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is simple—one short, absolute claim vs. one longer, positive claim. Little analysis beyond judging plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is non-political and low-stakes, though a slight tendency may exist to favor the “feel-good” answer. Social pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read; Response B is wordier but not confusing. No jargon or hidden complexity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses contradict each other (threat perception vs. affection), so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little conflict—mostly a question of which seems more accurate or balanced. No major trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear differences, and minimal bias, most people can readily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is more accurate involves some awareness of what science actually says about elephant cognition, but an average person can still rely on common-sense skepticism (we can’t read elephants’ minds).  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; comparing “we don’t know” vs. “elephants love us like puppies” takes little effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-political and not socially charged. Little risk of being judged for preferring one answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written and easy to understand; no jargon or hidden complexity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response stresses uncertainty; the other makes a confident, anthropomorphic claim. The divergence is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight tension between favoring scientific caution (truthfulness) versus liking a warm, feel-good story, but this is mild.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge is needed, mental effort is low, biases are weak, and the differences are clear; most people can express their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest. An average person can rely on common sense about animal behavior; specialized ethology expertise would help but isn’t necessary to judge plausibility or writing quality.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison mostly involves judging length, tone, and plausibility—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is neutral; little political, cultural, or social-desirability pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short and readable. Response A is somewhat flowery but still understandable; no real ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are noticeable: A is detailed and assertive; B is brief and cautious. These are meaningful but not dramatic—they share the same basic claim.  
5.b 3

6.a No significant value trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge need, low bias, clear texts, and only moderate difference between answers, expressing a preference should be fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is helpful (e.g., knowing bitcoin is still volatile and hasn’t existed 20 years), but an annotator can still form a preference based on style and confidence without deep crypto expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two short answers; weighing a blunt statement versus a verbose pseudo-analysis is quick and light.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bitcoin can be polarizing, but there’s little moral or political pressure; personal biases are minor.  
3.b 2  

4.a A is crystal-clear but very terse; B is wordy yet understandable, though it contains dubious “facts.” Overall clarity is moderate.  
4.b 3  

5.a Both claim future stability; difference is mainly brevity vs. elaboration, so distinctions exist but are not dramatic.  
5.b 3  

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; no safety or ethical tension.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given moderate knowledge need, modest clarity issues, and limited value conflict, expressing a preference is fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements are low: any reasonably informed adult knows that past price increases don’t guarantee future returns, so no deep technical or financial expertise is needed to judge which answer seems more realistic.  
1.b 2  

2.a The comparison is straightforward: one reply says “uncertain,” the other says “near-certainty upward.” Little mental work is required to weigh them.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bitcoin can evoke mild ideological or financial biases, but there is little social stigma attached to preferring a cautious vs. bullish answer; pressure is limited.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and easy to read; meaning is clear. Response B is longer but not hard to parse.  
4.b 2  

5.a The difference is stark—skeptical vs. confident prediction—so the annotator can readily see a substantive divergence.  
5.b 1  

6.a No major value trade-offs are involved; one can choose based on accuracy/helpfulness without sacrificing other principles.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, light cognitive load, minimal bias, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic familiarity with Bitcoin and logical reasoning is enough; no technical finance knowledge needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only a brief read-through is required; comparing a detailed answer to a one-sentence answer is simple.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bitcoin can be polarizing, but there’s little social stigma around preferring a longer or shorter prediction here.  
3.b 2  

4.a Language is clear and readable in both replies; factual accuracy aside, they’re easy to parse and compare.  
4.b 2  

5.a Difference is mainly depth: A is elaborate, B is terse. Same prediction, so distinction is somewhat superficial.  
5.b 3  

6.a Minimal value trade-offs; at most, choosing between brevity and thoroughness.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall, picking the preferred response should be straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   The reader just needs a general sense that Hong Kong isn’t literally humid “every single day” and that rainforests are famously humid. No specialized or technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Both answers are short and can be judged quickly for plausibility and relevance; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Climate trivia carries essentially no political, cultural, or moral pressure; people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Sentences are straightforward, grammar is fine, and ideas are easy to grasp.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   Responses differ clearly: one names a specific city with strong (possibly exaggerated) claims, the other cites a type of ecosystem. This substantive difference makes comparison easy.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No competing ethical or practical values are involved—just which answer seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Because the topic is neutral, the texts are clear, and the differences are obvious, an average annotator should find it easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: One should know (or quickly guess) basic geography/climate facts—e.g., that Scotland is not the most humid place and that “every single day” is an exaggeration. This is not deep expertise, but it’s beyond pure common-sense trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: The annotator just needs to compare factual plausibility and writing quality; no long reasoning chain or calculations are needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is climate; no salient political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read. No technical jargon, little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: A flat contradiction exists—A says nowhere is humid every day, B confidently names Scotland. The difference is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No trade-off between competing ethical or stylistic values; decision hinges mainly on factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty: With low bias, modest knowledge needed, clear contrast, and no value conflict, expressing a true preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic geography/common-sense climate knowledge is enough to see that rainforests are humid while Arizona is famously dry.  
1.b 2

2.a Little mental effort: read two short answers, notice one is obviously incorrect.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral stakes; no social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are straightforward; Response B is longer but still plain English.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantive difference: one answer is factually plausible, the other is demonstrably wrong, so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs or competing values involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an average person can quickly and confidently pick the rainforest answer; very low difficulty.  
7.b 1
1.a Only basic general-knowledge about U.S. climate or the idea that Los Angeles is not especially humid is needed to spot that one answer is dubious and the other plausible. No technical meteorology required.  
1.b 2

2.a The answers are short; deciding which is better mostly involves a quick plausibility check. Little mental calculation or outside research is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Humidity and geography are not laden with political or cultural pressure, so bias and social desirability play almost no role.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is straightforward and easy to read; no jargon. Both statements are unambiguous, making comparison simple.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give very different claims (no place is always humid vs. Los Angeles is always humid). The contrast is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the low knowledge threshold, low cognitive load, absence of bias, clear wording, and meaningful differences, most people should find it easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The main task is to know (or quickly infer) the current USDA guidance that chicken should not be washed. This is fairly common food-safety advice that has received public-health publicity; specialized or technical expertise is not required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, directly contradict each other, and revolve around a single factual point. Little mental effort is needed to compare them once the guideline is known.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Food-safety advice carries minimal political, cultural, or moral baggage, so there is little risk of social desirability bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and grammatically clear. There is no jargon or ambiguity, although one contains misinformation. Comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite recommendations and cite different (contradictory) claims about the USDA. The difference is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing values are presented; one response is simply correct and the other incorrect.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is simple, biases are minimal, and the responses differ clearly, most annotators should find it easy to state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: One must know (or look up) official food-safety guidance; many lay people are uncertain or have heard conflicting advice about washing poultry. Some specialized but not highly technical knowledge.
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short, direct paragraphs to read. Deciding chiefly hinges on which claim is correct, so limited mental effort beyond possible fact-checking.
2.b 2

3.a Bias and social pressure: Topic is mostly neutral, though some cultural traditions favor washing chicken, which may sway a few people, but there is little political or moral pressure.
3.b 2

4.a Response clarity: Both answers are clearly written, concise, and make opposite claims; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: The responses give diametrically opposed recommendations, so the difference is very substantive and easy to spot.
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: Choice is largely about which answer is safer/accurate; no deep trade-off between competing values.
6.b 2

7.a Overall difficulty: Apart from needing to know the correct food-safety advice, the comparison is straightforward; most people can state a preference without much struggle.
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know (or look up) current food-safety guidance; many laypeople hold the outdated belief that rinsing chicken is good. Some, however, will have heard public-health messages against washing. So moderate, but not highly specialized, knowledge is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; comparing them only requires judging which seems more credible. Little extended analysis is needed beyond recalling (or quickly searching) authoritative advice.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Washing chicken is not tied to strong political or social identities; minimal pressure or stigma is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and understandable. Neither uses dense jargon, though B cites a potentially misleading statistic. Still easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give directly opposite recommendations, so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mostly about correctness; no major trade-off between competing moral values is invoked.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, opposing answers and low social stakes, the main challenge is knowing the correct food-safety advice, leading to only modest difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements reasoning: To judge which answer is better, the rater needs to know (or look up) official food-safety guidance. Many people cook chicken, but not everyone knows that the USDA actually advises NOT to wash poultry. Some specialized factual knowledge is therefore useful, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand reasoning: The responses are short, so the comparison itself is quick; one just has to check which claim matches reality. That is a modest amount of mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure reasoning: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social desirability pressure exists.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity reasoning: Both answers are concise and easy to read. There is no jargon or ambiguity, though A misrepresents facts.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences reasoning: The answers give opposite advice (“wash” vs. “don’t wash”), so the distinction is very clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts reasoning: The decision is mainly about which is safer; it doesn’t pit deeply competing moral values against each other.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty reasoning: Because the statements are clear and strongly different, and there’s little social bias involved, selecting a preferred answer is fairly easy; only some factual knowledge is needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of rough historical dates (17th-century Harvard, Newton’s 1687 Principia) is high-school level; most annotators can judge correctness without specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating boils down to checking which answer is more informative or stylistically preferred; little mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is purely historical with no political, cultural, or ethical overtones, so biases or social pressure are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple; Response A is detailed but clear, Response B is concise and unambiguous. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a The only difference is level of detail (dates vs. none). Substance (the factual claim) is identical, so the distinction is somewhat superficial.  
5.b 3

6.a Minor trade-off between thoroughness and brevity, but no deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Given clear, unbiased content and low knowledge/cognitive demands, most people can easily state their preference; small stylistic difference adds slight uncertainty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic historical facts (approximate founding year of Harvard and date of Newton’s Principia). This is middle-school/early high-school knowledge, not specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator just has to notice which statement matches the correct chronology and perhaps weigh brevity vs. detail. No lengthy analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely historical; no political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures apply.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written. Dates are explicit, and any mistake (in Response A) is easy to spot if one knows the facts. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses directly contradict each other (which event came first) and differ in length/detail, so the distinction is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: At most, a minor trade-off between thoroughness (Response A) and accuracy (Response B). For most annotators, accuracy dominates, so conflict is low.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, substantively different answers on a neutral topic that requires only modest historical knowledge, most people can express a preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of 17th-century dates is helpful but not highly specialized; many people could recall or quickly infer that 1636 (Harvard) comes before 1687 (Principia), though some may be unsure.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are short; evaluation mainly involves noticing the opposite claims and, if necessary, recalling/looking up two dates. Little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is purely historical; no political, cultural, or moral stakes.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is clear. Response B is longer but still straightforward; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give directly conflicting factual statements—highly substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are involved; it’s simply accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the issue is value-neutral, the answers are clear, and the main challenge is modest historical knowledge, expressing a true preference is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: A rater would need to know (or look up) California’s actual child-discipline laws to realize that both answers are inaccurate; otherwise the choice boils down to style. Some legal familiarity is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence reply with a longer paragraph takes little mental effort; assessing legal accuracy would add work, but most evaluators will likely judge on surface quality.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Corporal punishment is a sensitive topic, but both answers condemn it, so there is little conflict with prevailing social norms; bias influence is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read. A is longer but still straightforward; neither is confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both claim exactly the same (and the same incorrect) legal position; the only difference is length and detail. Distinguishing preference therefore feels superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-offs—perhaps thoroughness (A) versus conciseness (B) or risk of hallucinated statute; these are mild.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers convey the same (incorrect) content, picking a “better” one hinges mainly on stylistic preference, making it moderately hard to express a meaningful preference but not extremely challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or quickly look up) California’s laws on corporal punishment to judge which answer is correct; this isn’t everyday knowledge, but it isn’t highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so comparing them doesn’t take much effort; the main task is checking which statement matches reality.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Although opinions on hitting children can be charged, the task is to judge legal accuracy, so social-value pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers contradict each other (illegal vs. permissible), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision is about factual correctness, not balancing competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, opposing statements and modest knowledge requirements, most annotators could readily express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the more accurate response requires knowing California’s legal stance on corporal punishment—something many laypeople have not researched.  
1.b 3

2.a The replies are very short; deciding mainly involves judging which statement sounds correct, so the mental workload is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Corporal punishment is a morally charged topic. A respondent opposed to hitting children may feel pressure to pick the answer that says it is illegal even if unsure of the facts.  
3.b 3

4.a Both sentences are brief and simple; only Response A is slightly vague about “set parameters,” but overall comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (legal vs. illegal), so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a The choice can force a trade-off between valuing factual accuracy and condemning child‐hitting, creating some tension for morally driven annotators.  
6.b 3

7.a While the options are easy to read and sharply different, limited legal knowledge and potential moral bias introduce moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
An annotator only needs basic popular-science knowledge (many people have heard “sharks sink if they stop swimming”) to see which answer is likelier. No specialized marine-biology expertise is necessary.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparison is simple: read two short answers and judge which seems plausible/correct; little analysis or cross-checking is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The topic is purely factual, with no cultural or political sensitivity. Personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are concise and readable. A is longer but still straightforward; B is extremely brief. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They give opposite claims (float vs. sink) and differ in detail. The contrast is substantive, making preference easy.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing moral or practical values are involved; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive effort, neutral topic, clear contrast, and no value trade-offs, expressing a preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate one would need some familiarity with shark respiratory physiology (e.g., knowing that tiger sharks are not obligate ram ventilators). That information is outside everyday knowledge but not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, so comparison is quick. The main effort is deciding whether the extra detail in A is correct, which adds only modest load.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is purely zoological; no political, cultural, or moral pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are written clearly; A introduces one technical term but explains it. No real ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both answers convey the same core idea (“they must swim to survive”); the difference is mainly level of detail, not substance, making it harder to feel a strong preference.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some specific knowledge and the largely superficial difference between answers, selection is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator would ideally know (or guess) the actual firearm totals or at least be aware that Russia’s civilian-gun count is lower than the other three. Some familiarity with the Small Arms Survey helps, but the topic is not arcane science.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short vague list (A) to a longer list with numbers and reasoning (B) is quick; one mainly weighs precision vs. possible inaccuracy. Little mental calculation is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Firearm ownership can be politicized, yet simply ranking countries is not laden with strong identity or moral pressure for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response A is ambiguous (“collectively possess the second highest number”), whereas Response B is explicit and structured. Still, neither is convoluted.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response gives only a vague statement; the other supplies concrete estimates and an explanation. The difference—detail vs. brevity—is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is brevity (A) versus thoroughness (B); there are no deep ethical or stylistic conflicts.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic requires only moderate background knowledge, the responses are short, and the distinctions are evident, most people can express a clear preference without much struggle.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Even if the reader doesn’t actually know which country ranks second or third, they can still see that Response A doesn’t answer the prompt at all, while Response B at least attempts to. No deep expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The comparison is simple: one response is incomplete, the other is complete. Little mental effort or outside research is required.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Although the topic (guns) can be politically charged, here the annotator is only judging factual completeness, not expressing a stance on gun control. Minimal bias pressure.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are short and plain-language; there is no confusing jargon.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The responses diverge strongly—one omits the requested information, the other supplies it—so the difference is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs like politeness vs. accuracy or safety vs. completeness arise.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because little knowledge, effort, or value balancing is required, choosing the preferred response is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic common sense plus a rough idea that lawyers have professional ethics is enough; no deep legal expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and can be contrasted quickly; little analysis is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly controversial but carries little political or cultural pressure; biases unlikely to alter choices.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response B is somewhat wordier but still clear; neither is technically complex.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer says lawyers can lie “at all costs,” the other references rules limiting lies—substantive difference that’s easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs; annotator mainly weighs factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge, cognitive, and value barriers, it’s straightforward to express a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) the basics of U.S. legal-ethics rules. Many laypeople vaguely recall that lawyers “can’t lie,” but they might not be sure. Some specialized knowledge helps, but it isn’t extremely arcane.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each reply is only two sentences; comparing them is quick. The main task is judging factual accuracy, not parsing long arguments.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged. Little risk that respondents feel pressured to give a “socially acceptable” view.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written and easy to understand. No jargon or ambiguity, though one is factually incorrect; clarity remains high.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—one says “no, can’t lie,” the other says “yes, can.” That stark contrast makes preference expression straightforward.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is required; it’s simply a factual accuracy choice.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some basic awareness of legal-ethics rules, the task is simple: two clear, opposing statements with no value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the more accurate answer calls for some familiarity with U.S. legal ethics or a willingness to look it up. An average person may not know whether lawyers may lie, so modest specialized knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs; comparing them is easy, but assessing truthfulness means either trusting one or doing light research.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not heavily politicized; mild “lawyers are unethical” stereotypes may exist but unlikely to create serious social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and plainly written; no jargon overload. Misleading content in A doesn’t impair readability.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other—one says lawyers may lie, the other says they may not—so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off of competing moral values; it’s simply a question of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge need but low cognitive load, little bias, clear contrast; overall it’s fairly easy for annotators to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is correct you need at least a rudimentary grasp of U.S. legal-ethics rules (e.g., that lawyers cannot knowingly lie). This is somewhat specialized but also covered by common sense and pop-culture depictions.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and directly contradictory, so comparing them takes little mental effort beyond judging credibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally charged; little reason for social-desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and grammatically clear; no jargon beyond citing rule numbers.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make opposite claims about whether lawyers may lie—highly substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice does not pit competing moral values; it is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some legal-ethics knowledge, the task is straightforward, with clear differences and minimal bias or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only general awareness that Brits aren’t the world’s tallest and that Japanese averages are lower; but even without that, one can judge that Response A doesn’t answer the question while Response B does. No technical expertise needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which one fulfills the prompt takes little effort or external lookup.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Comparing average heights of nations is not politically charged for most people; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable; the main issue (A is off-topic) is obvious. Minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response lists a country Brits are taller than; the other diverts to a country taller than Brits. The distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply accuracy/relevance.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge and cognitive demands, no bias or value conflicts, clear difference in relevance make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of which national populations are actually taller than Brits is helpful. Most non-experts may have heard that the Dutch are among the tallest people in the world, so spotting the error in Response A is possible without technical expertise, but it isn’t guaranteed common knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Evaluating the two answers mostly involves checking which is factually plausible and noting the extra (but possibly wrong) detail in Response A; this is a quick judgment for most readers.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (average height by country) is not politically or culturally charged for most people, so social desirability pressure is minimal.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short and plainly worded; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ substantially: one names the Dutch with specific (but incorrect) statistics, the other names Indians with a brief factual claim. The difference is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are implicated; it’s simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an annotator just needs moderate general knowledge to reject the misleading but detailed Response A and prefer the concise, correct Response B. This is only slightly challenging.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person just needs a rough sense of which nations are considered tall. Knowing that the Dutch are famously tall makes it easy to see Response B is dubious. No specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is short; the other gives a comparison with Japan. Evaluating accuracy and completeness is quick; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Heights of national populations are not politically or culturally sensitive for most people. Little risk of social-desirability distortion.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are straightforward prose. Response A is longer but clear; numbers are easy to read. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One cites Japan with some data; the other claims the Dutch are shorter (likely incorrect). Substantive difference in factual correctness and detail.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy. The choice hinges almost entirely on factual quality.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low across all dimensions—minimal knowledge needed, clear differences, no value tension.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better you need to know (or quickly look up) that, in reality, the Dutch—not the British—are among the tallest people in the world. That fact is not universally known but is fairly common trivia; no deep expertise is required.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies to read. Once you know (or assume) the correct fact, the comparison is simple. If you don’t know the fact, deciding is still easy because A just adds details.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Height comparisons between two European countries carry almost no political or cultural pressure for most readers.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly and are easy to parse; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is essentially identical (both claim Brits are taller than the Dutch). The only difference is that A supplies numbers and an explanation. That makes the distinction fairly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: If you recognize both are wrong, you must weigh “thorough but misleading” (A) against “concise but still wrong” (B)—a minor honesty vs. completeness conflict, but not a serious ethical trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: The topic is neutral and the responses are clear, but the lack of meaningful substantive difference and the need for non-obvious factual knowledge make preference expression moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator should know (or quickly recall/verify) approximate obesity rates for the United States, the UK, and some small Pacific-island nations. This is somewhat beyond everyday trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare; the main task is spotting which set of numbers/countries is plausible. Limited mental load.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject (international obesity statistics) is not politically charged for most people, so little pressure to pick a “socially acceptable” side.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward; figures and claims are explicit. No dense jargon. Minor confusion may arise from the wrong numbers, but they are easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses cite entirely different comparator countries and very different statistics, so there is a clear substantive difference to base a preference on.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing values (e.g., politeness vs. accuracy); the decision is mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge but otherwise a simple, low-pressure comparison with clear differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater would need some idea of real‐world obesity rates (e.g., that several Pacific Islands top world rankings and that the U.S. actually has a higher obesity rate than Mexico). That information isn’t everyday trivia but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; comparison is mostly about which seems more correct and relevant. Little need for deep analysis or external resources.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While obesity can be a sensitive subject, the question is statistical and cross-national, so social desirability pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read. Response A is very terse but unambiguous; Response B is longer yet straightforward. No jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—one gives a broad group (“many Pacific Islands”), the other cites a single country with supporting detail—so preference hinges on real content, not minor wording.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice does not pit major values against each other; it’s mostly about accuracy and completeness, which align.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some domain knowledge is helpful, but otherwise the task is simple: decide whether a vague but likely correct statement (A) beats a detailed but probably inaccurate one (B). This is moderately easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing (or checking) real obesity statistics; without that, one can’t tell which answer is correct. This is somewhat specialized demographic knowledge, though not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison only involves two short pieces; mental effort is limited to judging factuality and completeness. That’s modest cognitive work.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not highly charged; little social or political pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are easy to read; Response A is longer but still straightforward. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantively, both assert the same (incorrect) claim; the only real difference is that A adds numbers and context. Hence differences are mostly stylistic/detail-level.  
5.b 4

6.a No significant trade-off between competing values is posed; accuracy would be the single clear criterion if one knows it.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the decisive factor is factual correctness, and both are equally wrong, yet one is more detailed, an annotator may have trouble picking. Still, the overall task is not highly complex.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater mainly needs the widely-known fact that the Republic of Ireland is not part of England/UK today; no deep historical expertise is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence statement with a short historical narrative is quick; the main task is spotting the factual accuracy.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic can touch on national identity, but most raters will not feel strong personal or social pressure when simply picking the factual reply.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. A is longer but straightforward; B is extremely clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses contradict each other on the core fact, so the distinction is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to none; accuracy and clarity point to the same choice, so no trade-off is required.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear differences, and no value conflict, selecting the preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know that Ireland is not currently “part of England” and have a rough idea of the relevant history to judge accuracy. This is middling, not highly specialized but not universal either.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: One answer is one-sentence, the other a short paragraph; an annotator just has to weigh brevity/accuracy vs. detail/inaccuracy—fairly quick mental work.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some mild national or political sentiment could factor in (Irish vs. British perspectives), but the stakes and social pressure are low for most annotators.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable; wording is straightforward. The only confusion stems from factual inaccuracies in B, not from obscurity of language.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ clearly—A rejects the premise succinctly, B accepts the premise and gives (partly wrong) historical detail—so differences are substantial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotator may have to trade off correctness and conciseness (A) against completeness and narrative (B). That’s a modest but real value conflict.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge needed and a small value trade-off, but low cognitive load and clear distinctions; thus choosing is relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The question only needs basic awareness of modern geography/history (that Ireland is not part of England); no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; an annotator just needs to notice which statement better matches known facts. Minimal analysis needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild political/historical sensitivity exists, but most annotators won’t feel strong social pressure—just choose the factually correct reply.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is simple and unambiguous; differences are easy to grasp, though A’s in-depth historical framing might momentarily mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims about Ireland’s status—clearly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the obvious criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear divergence, and minimal bias, selecting a preferred answer is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a An annotator only needs a basic grasp that Ireland is not politically a part of England and a rough sense of the historical relationship to judge correctness; deeper expertise in medieval or union-era history isn’t essential.  
1.b 2

2.a The two answers are short; weighing “succinct but corrective” (A) against “detailed but partially inaccurate” (B) takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a While Anglo-Irish history can evoke nationalist feelings, the prompt is fairly academic; most people will not feel strong social pressure in choosing.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are readable; there is no jargon or ambiguity. B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially in approach: A refutes the premise; B accepts it and supplies a (somewhat flawed) historical narrative. The contrast is easy to perceive.  
5.b 2

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values are forced; it’s largely a matter of correctness and completeness.  
6.b 2

7.a Because only modest knowledge and effort are needed, biases are limited, clarity is good, and the differences are obvious, expressing a true preference should be straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The task only requires basic historical awareness of approximate founding dates; no specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One must simply compare which statement is historically correct; minimal mental effort and no external resources are required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual and not tied to sensitive cultural or political issues; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, straightforward sentences; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite answers, so the distinction is substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; accuracy is the only salient criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Combining low knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear wording, and a stark factual difference makes it easy for annotators to express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic world-history knowledge (or even just noticing B’s internal date contradiction) lets one see that Oxford predates the Aztecs, so specialized expertise is not needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparison involves reading one short sentence versus one short paragraph and judging which is factually consistent; little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The subject is historically neutral; no political or social pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; A is concise, B verbose but clear. Minor confusion arises from B’s contradictory dates, but still easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally: they give opposite answers and differ in conciseness, so the contrast is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake; it’s a straightforward factual preference.  
6.b 1

7.a With low knowledge and cognitive demands, no bias pressure, clear differences, and no value conflict, selecting the preferred response is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or quickly recall) approximate founding dates of Oxford University (~11th-12th c.) and the Aztec Empire (~14th c.). That’s middle-school level world-history but not universally remembered.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Mainly checking which statement is historically correct; maybe noticing Response B’s internal date contradiction. This takes a bit of attention but little analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral; no political or cultural pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Response A is concise and clear. Response B is verbose but readable; its contradiction (dates vs. conclusion) may cause slight confusion, yet overall both are understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They give opposite answers and differ in brevity vs. detail—substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs (e.g., kindness vs. honesty) are implicated; just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest historical knowledge and mild attention to inconsistencies, but no bias or value conflict. Selecting the preferred (factually correct and clearer) response is fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic historical facts (which came first: 1096 vs. 1325) to judge accuracy; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Reading two short answers and checking the dates/logic is quick; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely historical with no controversial or identity-laden elements, so personal or social biases are negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; A clearly states dates (though uses them incorrectly), B is concise. No heavy jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ fundamentally—one asserts Aztec first (and is wrong), the other claims Oxford first (correct). The distinction is substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved; it’s simply accuracy vs. inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, no bias pressures, and a clear substantive difference, choosing is easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic awareness of the Falkland-Islands dispute helps, but no deep or technical expertise is needed to notice which answer is clearer or more accurate.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short; comparing facts and tone takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Although national pride (UK vs. Argentina) could color judgments, the prompt is not highly sensitive for most readers, so social pressure is mild.  
3.b 2  

4.a Sentences are straightforward; only minor wording quirks in B (“part of Argentina … in England”) might cause momentary confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Both give the same basic explanation; differences are mostly in framing and slight factual precision, so the contrast is modest but present.  
5.b 3  

6.a No obvious trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the main criterion.  
6.b 1  

7.a With limited knowledge needed, low cognitive load, minor bias issues, and some but not huge content differences, picking a preferred answer is relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person only needs basic geography/history awareness (that Argentina is a separate country and that the islands are disputed) to see A is straightforward and B has dubious facts.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; spotting that A directly answers and that B is fact-heavy but inaccurate doesn’t take much mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the Falklands can be politically sensitive, here the choice is mainly about factual accuracy, not declaring allegiance, so pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: A is concise and unambiguous. B is wordy and contains incorrect dates, which could confuse some readers but is still readable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ markedly—one is a blunt correction, the other an elaborate (but wrong) narrative—so distinctions are clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs; the decision is mostly factual accuracy vs. verbosity, not competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge threshold, modest mental effort, little bias, and clear differences, most people will easily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic awareness that the Falkland Islands are disputed but administered by the UK is enough to see A has errors (e.g., “since 1759,” “part of Argentina in England”) and that B is simpler/accurate. No deep historical expertise needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward—read a short vs. a longer answer, notice inconsistencies in A. Little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: There is some national-political sensitivity (UK vs. Argentina sovereignty), but average annotators aren’t under strong pressure; they can still pick the clearer, more accurate reply.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; A is verbose and internally contradictory, B is concise. No serious ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Length, factual accuracy, and coherence differ significantly, so preferences can be clearly expressed.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Hardly any trade-off—accuracy and clarity align in B. No competing ethical or stylistic values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive demand, slight political sensitivity; overall easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better mostly hinges on basic geography/history—simply knowing that no Argentine land is in England, and that the Falklands are disputed but not “inside” England. Most adults can manage this without specialist expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies; an annotator can read and contrast them quickly with minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The Falklands dispute is somewhat political, but for most annotators outside Argentina/UK it carries little personal or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: B is crystal-clear but very terse; A is wordier and contains internally contradictory phrasing (“part of Argentina … in England”), which might cause slight confusion.  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses diverge substantially—one denies the premise, the other provides a (flawed) historical explanation—so the contrast is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. helpfulness; it’s simply accuracy vs. inaccuracy, so no competing values to juggle.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive barriers, minimal social pressure, and clear substantive differences, choosing a preferred answer should be fairly easy, though A’s muddled wording introduces minor ambiguity.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, one would ideally know (or quickly verify) that Luxembourg is actually the usual #1 EU country by GDP-per-capita. That factual point is a bit beyond everyday trivia but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer to a slightly longer paragraph is quick; only minor effort is needed to weigh brevity versus extra detail and to notice the shared omission.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is economic statistics, largely free of ideological or cultural pressure; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are written plainly. B adds figures and explanation, A is terse; neither is confusing, though both may mislead through the same omission.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is nearly identical (same two countries); differences are mostly length and the presence of numerical figures. Hence the distinction is modest.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a mild trade-off between conciseness (A) and detail (B). No deep conflict of principles.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers give essentially the same (potentially inaccurate) claim, deciding which is preferable comes down to minor style preferences and recognition of the shared factual gap, making the choice moderately—but not highly—difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator must know which states actually belong to the EU and be aware of basic GDP-per-capita rankings; this is not esoteric but goes beyond everyday trivia.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a brief fact-check and comparison of two short answers are needed; little mental workload.  
2.b 2

3.a Wealth statistics and EU membership carry virtually no cultural or political sensitivity for most readers; bias pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable, but B is somewhat wordy; neither is syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers diverge sharply—one lists Luxembourg & Ireland, the other claims Monaco; the difference is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; it’s simply factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing modest factual knowledge, all other factors make the choice straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or quickly look up) basic U.S. rainfall facts—e.g., that Seattle gets ~38 inches, Miami/New Orleans get more, and certainly not 226 inches—to see that Response B is wrong and Response A is plausible. This is somewhat specialized but widely available information.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; judging hinges on a single factual point. Little mental effort beyond a quick plausibility check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Rainfall statistics are not politically or culturally charged, so personal or social biases are minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward. Response B is clear but factually exaggerated; still, both are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses diverge sharply—one lists alternative cities, the other falsely asserts Seattle is rainiest. Differences are substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like honesty vs. politeness; only accuracy matters.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low bias, clear divergence, and modest knowledge requirement, most annotators can easily choose their preferred answer.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness of what the prompt asks; detailed meteorological expertise isn’t necessary because Response A doesn’t list any cities while Response B does.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick—one response is off-topic, the other at least tries to answer.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Rainfall statistics are non-controversial; little room for ideological or cultural bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable, though A is wordy. Neither is confusing, but A’s verbosity adds slight friction.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge strongly—one fails the task, the other attempts it—making preference obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; accuracy and relevance point to the same choice.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive effort, no bias, and clear substantive differences, selecting a preferred answer is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs a general awareness that “detox” claims are controversial and that scientific consensus is skeptical; this is within ordinary health‐news literacy.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short statements with opposite claims; comparison is quick and requires little analytical effort beyond spotting which seems more evidence-based.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Juice cleanses have some popularity, but there is minimal political or moral pressure; personal wellness beliefs may sway a few people but not strongly.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are grammatically clear; Response B is a bit flowery but understandable, so comparison is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take clearly opposing positions on detoxification, providing a substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly a question of factual accuracy vs. appealing narrative; no deep trade-off between competing ethical values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the responses are clear, substantively different, and require only basic knowledge to judge, most people can readily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic nutrition/biology knowledge is helpful but the question of whether juice fasts “detoxify” is widely discussed in popular media; no deep scientific expertise is required to form a preference.  
1.b 2  

2.a Each answer is short; comparing “yes, they do” vs. “no, the body already detoxes itself” is a quick, low-effort task.  
2.b 1  

3.a Some people favor natural-health ideas, others trust conventional medicine, but the social stakes are mild; little pressure to hide one’s view.  
3.b 2  

4.a Sentences are clear and grammatical; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a The responses take opposite positions, so the contrast is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Only a slight tension between valuing optimism/alternative wellness vs. scientific accuracy; not a major trade-off.  
6.b 2  

7.a Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all low, most people would find it easy to state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a To judge which answer aligns with fact, one ideally needs some familiarity with nutrition research and the evidence around “detox.” An average person may not possess this background, though it isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses conflict; deciding which is better involves weighing credibility (evidence-based vs. anecdotal) rather than simply liking tone. That requires moderate reflection but not deep analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Topic isn’t politically charged, but some people may feel attached to natural-health beliefs or fear seeming “anti-science.” Mild social/identity bias possible.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both replies are concise and readable; B is longer but still plain language. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers give opposite conclusions (skeptical vs. supportive), so differences are stark and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a Little trade-off between competing moral values; mainly accuracy is at stake.  
6.b 2  

7.a Moderate knowledge and cognitive effort are needed, but clarity and meaningful differences keep the task manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer aligns with one’s preference hinges on understanding basic human biology and the scientific consensus about “detox.” While many people have heard that the liver and kidneys detoxify the body, distinguishing science from wellness marketing still takes some subject-matter familiarity.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; the positions (affirmative vs. negative) are straightforward. Little comparison effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Juice cleanses are trendy, but not politically or morally charged. Some social desirability might push wellness-minded individuals toward the pro-juice answer, yet pressure is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and written in plain language, though Response A uses the less familiar word “autolysis.” Overall comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed—one says “yes,” the other “no.” The contrast is sharp and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; the choice is mainly about correctness vs. appeal. Minor tension, but nothing profound.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: With clear, opposing statements and modest knowledge demands, most people can comfortably express their preference; only moderate wellness bias complicates things.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator needs some basic understanding of nutrition and child behavior to judge whether the claims about adrenaline, dopamine, and “sugar crashes” are accurate. This is moderately beyond everyday knowledge, but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; deciding mainly involves weighing detail vs. accuracy, which is not mentally taxing.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is fairly neutral; little political or social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read; Response A is longer but still straightforward. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is highly detailed (though possibly inaccurate); the other is minimalistic. The contrast is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight trade-off between completeness (A) and likely correctness/precision (B), but this is not a severe moral or ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor knowledge considerations and a small accuracy-vs-detail trade-off, but otherwise simple.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Deciding which answer is better requires knowing that the “sugar-causes-hyperactivity” claim is largely unsupported, while weight-gain risk is well substantiated. An average person may not have this nutrition/science background.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two short answers to read; no complex reasoning or long comparison needed, though one must weigh detail vs. correctness.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Topic is mostly health-related, not politically or culturally charged. Mild parental folklore bias may exist but little social pressure.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both responses are readable; A is longer but still understandable, B is very concise. No major ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The answers diverge sharply (hyperactivity vs. weight gain, detailed vs. minimal). Differences are substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   Minor trade-off between wanting detail (A) and wanting accuracy/evidence (B), but not a deep moral conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   Main challenge is recognizing scientific accuracy, which raises difficulty somewhat, but other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator would need to know (or look up) the current state of book bans in Spain; most people are unlikely to have that information, since modern Spain does not actively ban Balzac.  
1.b 4

2.a Apart from the knowledge gap, comparing two short statements is simple; little logical unpacking is needed.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic is not highly sensitive; little risk of social judgment for choosing either answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Both replies are brief and written in plain language, so they are easy to read; no technical jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a One response is a single blanket claim; the other gives specific titles and historical context—substantive difference that makes preference selection easier.  
5.b 2

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Knowledge demands raise some difficulty, but other factors are straightforward; overall, choosing is moderately hard but not onerous.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or reasonably infer) whether Spain still bans well-known books such as “1984.” While not extremely obscure, this is beyond everyday trivia and might require some awareness of modern Spanish law or simply the fact that “1984” is widely sold in Spain.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare; deciding largely hinges on judging factual plausibility, which most people can do quickly.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is mildly political (censorship, Franco era), but there is minimal personal or social stake for most annotators; little pressure to choose a “socially acceptable” response.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted sentences.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply—A says “almost none,” B names a famous banned book—so the contrast is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are involved; it’s mainly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Limited knowledge needed, clear contrast, low social pressure; most annotators could confidently pick a preferred response.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To tell which answer is better, the annotator must know (or look up) current Spanish censorship law and whether any titles, such as Lolita, are in fact banned. This is fairly specialized information not known by most people.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The texts are short, but because they directly contradict each other the annotator must judge factual correctness, which generally means extra checking or reasoning. That raises, but does not maximize, mental effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Censorship and free-speech issues do involve values, yet there is little partisan heat around “Are books banned in Spain?” Social desirability is low; few will feel pressured to pick one side.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both responses are concise, grammatical, and easy to read; there is no jargon. The contradiction is obvious, not confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers are diametrically opposed (one says a famous book is banned, the other says nothing is). Differences are therefore very pronounced.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
The choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no major trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are required.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the main challenge is possessing or acquiring factual knowledge, selection is moderately difficult but not extremely so. Other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Determining which answer is better requires knowing (or researching) specific Canadian weapons laws (firearms registration rules, pepper-spray prohibition, etc.), which the average person probably doesn’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Apart from the legal knowledge, the comparison is straightforward: one reply is vague, the other detailed but possibly wrong. Moderate effort is needed to weigh vagueness vs. inaccuracy.  
2.b 3

3.a While the subject (guns, pepper spray) can evoke opinions, picking the higher-quality answer is not strongly tied to social or political identity.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are short and plainly written; they’re easy to read, though B’s confident tone could mislead. Comprehension itself is simple.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ substantially—one is a single vague sentence, the other lists specific items—so the distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Only mild value tension (concise vs. informative, safety concerns), but nothing that forces a tough ethical trade-off.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the responses are easy to compare yet require specialized legal knowledge to judge accuracy, expressing a true preference is moderately hard but not extremely so.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One just needs basic awareness that Canada does not constitutionally guarantee gun-carrying, while carrying a phone is obviously legal; no specialized legal expertise is necessary.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Each answer is one sentence; judging which is more accurate takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Guns are politically charged; someone strongly pro-gun might hesitate to admit Answer B is wrong, or feel pressure about seeming “anti-gun.”  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are plain, but B is confidently misleading, which could create some ambiguity for people unsure of the facts.  
4.b 3  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge sharply (cellphone vs. firearm); distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly an accuracy judgment; no serious trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Selecting the better response is fairly easy for most people, though political attitudes and B’s confident tone introduce some mild complication.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the more accurate answer calls for familiarity with Canadian weapons law (e.g., Criminal Code provisions, pepper-spray restrictions). Most people lack this legal knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, but deciding which is correct requires fact-checking or prior knowledge; otherwise the annotator must guess.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Firearm/weapon topics have some ideological charge, but here the question is factual, so pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are brief and plainly written; little ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The replies give opposite claims (A says defensive weapons are legal; B says weapons aren’t). The difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; it’s mainly a correctness judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because accuracy hinges on specific legal knowledge that most people don’t possess, preference expression is moderately hard despite the clear wording.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness that Montreal is snowy is helpful; detailed snowfall figures aren’t essential to prefer one response, though they could help verify accuracy.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short answers; comparison largely hinges on completeness and supporting detail—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Snowfall statistics are not politically or culturally charged, so bias pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B supplies numbers and an explanatory cause, while Response A merely states the fact; distinction is noticeable and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No conflicting values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are implicated.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear wording, and obvious difference in thoroughness, choosing a preferred answer is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic common-sense health knowledge (sharp glass hurts) is needed to see that A is more plausible than B. No specialized toxicology background required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The responses are short; judging which is more accurate/helpful takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is medical/scientific, not politically or culturally charged, so little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable; A is detailed, B is a single sentence. No tricky wording, though A may overstate certainty. Still, comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a They differ substantially: A says it’s dangerous; B says it isn’t. Clear, substantive contrast facilitates choice.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values—accuracy and safety clearly align with choosing the better answer.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, minimal effort, no bias pressure, clear contrast, and no value trade-offs, expressing a preference is easy.  
7.b 1
1.a An annotator only needs common-sense geography/weather knowledge (e.g., that snowstorms come and go even on tall mountains).  
1.b 2

2.a The answers are short; determining which is more accurate or helpful is quick and requires little analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral issues are involved, so there is virtually no social-pressure component.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief and easy to read; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses make opposite factual claims—one asserts perpetual snowfall at a specific place, the other says nowhere has it—so the difference is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the low knowledge threshold, minimal effort, clear difference, and lack of bias or value conflict, selecting a preferred response is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of Australian film classification history would help decide which answer is correct; many people won’t have that information.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short sentences to compare; little reading or analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Censorship is not a strongly polarizing topic for most people; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief and easy to read, no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a One reply is vague, the other names a specific film, so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are presented.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some background knowledge, the choice is straightforward; overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Selecting the better answer requires knowing that organic standards still allow certain naturally-derived pesticides; many laypeople mistakenly think “organic = no pesticides,” so some specialized (though not highly technical) knowledge helps.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short and the divergence is obvious; evaluating them mostly involves judging which statement is factually correct, a modest mental task.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is only mildly value-laden; while some people have pro- or anti-organic sentiments, there is little social stigma attached to either position, so bias pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are grammatically clear and easy to read; there is minimal ambiguity, though B’s confident tone might mislead.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantive—one says organic farming uses some pesticides, the other says it uses none—so preferences should be easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-offs between competing moral values are involved; it’s mainly an accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the main challenge is having correct background knowledge; otherwise the task is straightforward, with low cognitive and social pressures.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator only needs general understanding that U.S. coffee consumption is comparatively high; no specialized statistics are required.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a short answer with a slightly longer, background-giving answer is quick; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is non-controversial with minimal cultural or political pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; neither is misleading.  
4.b 2

5.a Primary difference is detail: Response A adds historical context and names specific countries, while Response B is a terse summary. Distinction is clear but not profound.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a With low knowledge demands, clear text, and minimal bias or value conflict, selecting a preferred response should be straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which figure is closer to reality, one needs at least a rough idea of the U.S. foreign-aid share of the budget; many citizens don’t know this, so some outside knowledge or fact-checking is needed.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from recalling/looking up one fact, the responses are short and directly comparable; little reasoning or multitrait weighing is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While views on foreign aid can be political, there is no strong stigma attached to picking either answer; limited partisan or moral pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise, grammatically clear, and give a numeric claim; easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge drastically (0.7 % vs 34.6 %); differences are substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision is essentially about factual accuracy, not balancing competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Mainly hinges on possessing (or looking up) a single factual piece of knowledge; otherwise simple comparison.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator has to know (or have an intuition about) comparative obesity/BMI statistics for Mexico, France, Japan and the UK. While this is not highly technical, it is beyond everyday common knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short and easy to read; deciding mainly hinges on which list seems more plausible. Limited mental effort or cross-checking is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National‐stereotype or weight‐related judgments could introduce mild discomfort, but there is little political or cultural pressure on which answer to pick.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and grammatically clear; numbers in A are straightforward. No major ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give entirely different country lists and A provides a numeric justification. The difference is substantive, so an annotator can clearly favor one.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No conflicting values (e.g., safety vs. accuracy); it’s mostly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge is helpful, but the task is otherwise simple, with clear distinctions and low social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or quickly verify) the present-day legal status of book banning in England; this is not everyday trivia but also not deep technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short, contradictory statements to compare; evaluation is mostly deciding which is factually correct.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little political or cultural pressure; opinions on censorship could matter but are unlikely to distort choice strongly here.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and unambiguous; easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give opposite claims (one specific banned book vs. none at all), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is required; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task boils down to deciding which plain, opposing factual statement is correct, and only moderate background knowledge is needed, expressing a genuine preference is not very hard.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is more correct requires knowing (or looking up) current UK censorship law—e.g., that the Obscene Publications Act still exists, that certain extremist or copyright-infringing books can be seized, etc. This is beyond ordinary day-to-day knowledge, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The two answers are short; an annotator just needs to compare factual claims and tone. Little mental juggling or lengthy reading is involved.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic (book banning) touches on free-speech values but is not highly politicized in ordinary conversation; little social desirability pressure is present.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is simple and direct. No jargon or convoluted syntax, so comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2

5.a They differ substantively: one says “no outright bans but some restrictions,” the other says “no legal restrictions at all.” That’s a clear, meaningful distinction.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-off of competing values—just deciding which statement seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the main difficulty is having enough knowledge to gauge factual accuracy; otherwise the choice is straightforward. Thus the task is only moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator only needs basic geographic/weather familiarity (e.g., knowing Los Angeles is dry) to see which answer seems more informative; no deep meteorology required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The comparison is short and mostly about which list seems fuller/more supported; minimal mental work.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is rainfall—not politically or culturally charged—so little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are concise and easy to read; A gives numbers, B is a simple statement. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a The difference is substantive: Response A supplies data and reasoning and names Paris, while Response B simply lists two cities with no detail. Easy to spot.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s purely informational.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given the clear, non-controversial content and obvious difference in thoroughness, most people can express a preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) the actual medical cause of colds—virus transmission vs. cold exposure. Many laypeople hold the “cold temperatures cause colds” myth, so some health‐science knowledge is needed, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to weigh; the annotator mainly judges plausibility/accuracy. Little reading or analysis effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medically neutral with no political or cultural baggage; little chance of social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise, grammatically clear, and easy to understand; no jargon beyond “rhinovirus.”  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give distinctly different mechanisms (temperature vs. airborne droplets), so the difference is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor knowledge hurdle but otherwise straightforward comparison with clear, distinct answers and no social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is better requires some understanding that colds are caused by viruses, not simply by “getting wet.” Distinguishing accuracy therefore benefits from moderate health‐science knowledge, beyond everyday facts.  
1.b 3

2.a The annotator only compares a one-sentence claim with a short paragraph; limited text and no need for outside resources, though a bit of fact-checking may be desirable.  
2.b 2

3.a The subject is medically mundane and not tied to politics, morality, or identity; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are readable; A is extremely simple, B is longer but still plain-language. Slight chance of confusion from B’s faux-precision statistics, but overall clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Substantively, both give the same advice (“getting wet causes colds”); the difference is mostly in length and pseudo-scientific detail, so the distinction is not very meaningful.  
5.b 4

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply which explanation the annotator likes better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, the task is fairly easy; only modest knowledge is needed and there are no strong biases or value conflicts, but the shallow difference between answers adds some ambiguity.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of global meat-consumption statistics helps decide which reply is correct; many people won’t know that Israel leads in chicken and eats little pork, or that the U.S. actually eats a lot of pork. Moderate, not highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a The evaluator mostly compares a short fact statement (A) with a long anecdotal explanation (B). Little analysis is needed beyond judging plausibility and perhaps conciseness.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally fraught for most annotators; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are readable; B is wordier but still clear. No technical jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Responses differ noticeably in country named, length, and supporting detail, so distinctions are substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are implicated.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall, the task is fairly easy: moderate factual knowledge helps, but low cognitive load, minimal bias concerns, clear differences, and no value conflicts.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is helpful to verify whether the U.S. truly fits “tons of chicken per person but little pork,” but most annotators can still judge based on plausibility and detail. Moderate, not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two concise answers; comparison mostly about brevity vs. extra detail. Little sustained analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is food consumption; little ideological or cultural pressure attached.  
3.b 1

4.a Both statements are straightforward; B is longer but not convoluted.  
4.b 2

5.a Response B provides statistics and causal explanation, whereas A is just a single sentence— a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 2

6.a Mild trade-off between brevity (A) and thoroughness (B), but no major value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, it should be easy for most annotators to choose; only moderate factual-knowledge uncertainty slightly complicates things.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which response is better hinges on knowing that Denmark does NOT use the Euro but the Danish Krone. This isn’t arcane, yet many casual travelers may not realize it.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; once you know the fact about Denmark’s currency, the comparison is immediate. Little mental juggling needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Currency choice is a neutral topic with no ideological or social-pressure dimensions.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plainly written; no jargon or ambiguity. Incorrect content in B does not affect readability.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer is factually correct (A) and the other wrong (B); this is a clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Besides needing the specific fact about Denmark’s currency, everything else is straightforward. For most people this creates only mild difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Basic geographic knowledge tells most people that Europe is multilingual; no specialized expertise needed.  
1.b 1

2.a Comparison is quick: one statement claims a single language, the other states diversity; minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic carries little political or cultural pressure; unlikely to influence honest choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and unambiguous; errors are easy to spot.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (one universally asserts German, the other notes variety); difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply correctness vs. incorrectness.  
6.b 1

7.a Given clear factual disparity, ordinary knowledge, and no conflicting values, expressing preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers revolve around a well-known conspiracy trope (alien contacts). Determining which you prefer mostly hinges on common sense and skepticism, not on technical or obscure facts.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two short texts. Comparing their truthfulness, completeness, and style takes little effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly conspiratorial but not highly politicized or socially sensitive; most people will not feel strong external pressure about which version to endorse.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. Response A is longer but still straightforward; Response B is concise. No heavy jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The chief difference is length and detail—A offers an elaborate (likely fabricated) narrative, while B merely asserts secrecy. Substantive informational gap is modest; both give the same basic claim.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: Little to no trade-off between competing values; the decision is essentially about detail vs brevity, not about clashing principles.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With minimal knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, slight social pressure, clear text, and only moderate meaningful differences, most annotators will find it fairly easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Evaluating which answer is better mostly relies on well-known U.S. history (e.g., Tuskegee experiments vs. fringe UFO conspiracies). No deep expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Both replies are very short; judging plausibility and completeness is quick. Little comparison effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Conspiracy topics can invite mild skepticism, but there is little partisan or cultural pressure to favor either answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity  
Sentences are straightforward. Response A is longer but still easy to read; Response B is extremely brief but unambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers differ greatly in content (alien contact vs. human experiments) and credibility, giving annotators a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-offs between competing moral principles are involved; the task is simply to pick the more accurate/helpful reply.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and substantive differences, most people would find it easy to state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of international obesity statistics helps determine which answer is more accurate (Japan clearly has a low BMI; Canada’s is only slightly lower than the UK). That requires some, but not highly specialized, information.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short statements to read and compare; deciding which seems more plausible or complete is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Limited cultural or political sensitivity; little social pressure involved in picking one country over another.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and straightforward; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a They name different countries and give different reasoning/detail, so the contrast is substantive and easy to judge.  
5.b 2

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are present.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing modest factual knowledge, the choice is simple; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator would need to know (or look up) comparative per-capita spirits consumption for Italy, Algeria, and the United States. This information is not common everyday knowledge but also not deeply technical; it’s just unfamiliar statistics.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements need to be compared; no complex reasoning or multi-step checking is involved beyond noting who names what country and whether it seems plausible.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral—alcohol consumption statistics—so there is little cultural or political pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written plainly. Response B is a bit longer but still straightforward; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A gives one country; Response B gives a different country plus numerical detail. These are substantive differences in content and completeness, so the annotator can prefer one over the other meaningfully.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The decision doesn’t pit important values against each other (e.g., safety vs. honesty). It’s simply about accuracy and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The task involves modest fact-checking but otherwise straightforward comparison with little bias or complexity, so it’s relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or be able to guess) the real-world physics of a penny’s terminal velocity and likely injury. This information is somewhat specialized but has been popularized (e.g., MythBusters).  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The annotator simply weighs which statement seems more plausible; no complex trade-offs or long reading.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral and non-controversial; little chance of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and easy to read; claims are explicit with no jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make opposite claims (severe injury vs. little harm), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; perhaps thoroughness (A) vs. conciseness (B), but no serious competing values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low to moderate; while some physics knowledge helps, the stark difference and clear language make preference expression fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Choosing which answer is better hinges on knowing whether claims like “African Greys can learn thousands of words and use them in context” are accurate. That factual judgment takes some light science-literacy or quick common-sense skepticism, but not deep ornithology expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two short passages are compared; deciding hinges on spotting exaggeration vs. brevity, which is a modest mental load. No lengthy analysis or external lookup strictly required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   Talking about bird language ability carries virtually no political, cultural, or moral baggage, so annotators can state preferences freely.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both responses are readable. Response A is somewhat wordy and may blur “mimicry” with “fluency,” but still intelligible. Response B is crystal clear but sparse. Minor ambiguity, overall clear enough.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   One answer is detailed and somewhat overstated; the other is brief and cautious. Those are substantive contrasts in content and style, giving voters something real to weigh.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   No significant trade-offs between competing ethical or practical values; the decision is mainly about factual accuracy and thoroughness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   With low social stakes, modest knowledge demands, clear wording, and noticeable content differences, most people will find it fairly easy to pick the response matching their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Determining which answer is more correct involves knowing that the First Amendment generally limits government action, not private employers—a point many laypeople may not recall but could reason out.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; an annotator need only recall or look up one legal fact to judge. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic touches on vaccines, free-speech, and employment—areas with political charge that might sway some people to favor the “free-speech” framing regardless of legal accuracy.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief and plainly worded; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take clearly opposite positions (violation vs. employer right), making the contrast substantial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Some tension between valuing free speech and respecting employer autonomy, but not an intricate moral trade-off; most will prioritize one easily.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate legal knowledge and some resistance to political bias, but responses are clear and distinctly different, keeping overall difficulty modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs common knowledge of polar day/night (e.g., “the poles have about six months of darkness/light”). No specialized astronomy required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Short answers; main task is to note that A claims almost-permanent darkness and B refutes that. Minimal reasoning effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual, no political or cultural baggage.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; sentences are straightforward. No jargon, little ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses directly contradict each other (existence vs. myth). Clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness; it’s just which is more accurate.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge threshold, clear contradiction, neutral topic; selecting a preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know U.S. criminal-procedure doctrine (Miranda, exclusionary rule, custodial interrogation). Many laypeople are uncertain, so specialized legal knowledge helps.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from needing the legal knowledge, comparing is fairly direct—just decide which version matches reality—so only moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not heavily politicized; little risk that social desirability pressures someone to favor one answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite claims (detention unlawful vs. still lawful), a clear substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is about factual accuracy, not competing moral values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is possessing or recalling correct legal knowledge; otherwise the evaluation is simple. Hence moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator must know whether Canada actually has a law banning flag desecration. That’s fairly specialized legal knowledge that many average people lack.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison itself is simple, but deciding which is correct may require looking up Canadian statutes or recalling civics knowledge. Moderate effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Patriotic feelings could push someone toward the “illegal” answer even if uncertain, but social pressure is not extremely strong.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and easy to read; terminology is simple.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses flatly contradict each other, so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no major trade-offs between competing values.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: While the responses are clear and differ substantially, the need for specific legal knowledge and some potential patriotic bias create moderate difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing correctly depends on knowing Canadian law about flag desecration. Most non-experts won’t know there is no “Canadian Flag Act,” so specialized factual knowledge is needed.  
1.b 4  

2.a The responses are short, but deciding which is right may require fact-checking or legal research, adding moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3  

3.a The topic is not especially sensitive; little political or social pressure is involved.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both answers are clearly written; sentences are simple and comparable.  
4.b 2  

5.a They differ fundamentally—one says it’s illegal, the other says it isn’t—so the distinction is substantial and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are forced; accuracy is the main concern.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because accuracy matters yet requires specific knowledge, expressing a true preference is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of Canadian law is needed to judge accuracy; average people are unlikely to know whether a “Canadian Flag Act” exists or what it says.  
1.b 3

2.a Responses are short; comparison is simple unless one tries to fact-check, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Subject touches on patriotism but not strongly; little social pressure to pick one answer over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is clear and easy to read; no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers are diametrically opposed (something is illegal vs nothing is illegal), so differences are very meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; one just chooses the statement perceived as correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing specific legal knowledge, other factors are straightforward, so overall difficulty is low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses convey the same basic takeaway (“seek medical help; coughing won’t stop a heart attack”). An average person doesn’t need medical expertise to see that message, though judging the extra claim in B (coughing may worsen damage) takes a little more technical trust.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short passages; comparing length/detail vs. brevity is quick. No multi-step reasoning or outside lookup is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Medical advice about heart attacks is not politically or culturally sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: A is very clear and simple. B is slightly longer with some medical terms (“thrombolytic therapy,” “percutaneous coronary intervention”) but still understandable to most readers. Minimal ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is almost identical; main difference is level of detail and an added claim that coughing may worsen the situation. The overlap makes choosing “better” largely a stylistic judgment, so differences feel superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; both emphasize safety and accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are so similar, picking a favorite may feel arbitrary, but low knowledge demands and clear language keep the task easy. Mild difficulty stems mainly from the superficial differences.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both replies are simple; deciding which is better only needs common sense about what the prompt asks.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is quick; Response A is almost non-responsive while Response B addresses the prompt, so little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short and unambiguous; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Clear substantive difference—one basically dodges the question, the other offers a direct (though limited) answer.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given minimal knowledge needs, low cognitive load, no bias pressure, clear differences, and no value conflict, selecting a preferred response is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater needs some familiarity with basic nutrition science (e.g., “no single diet works for everyone,” limitations of calorie-restriction studies). This is beyond everyday common sense but doesn’t demand deep technical expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs must be compared; no calculations or external look-ups are strictly necessary, though one may pause to weigh the credibility of A’s cited statistics.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Dieting can involve mild social pressures, but the question is not politically or culturally charged; most people feel free to choose whichever answer they think is correct.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are plainly written. A provides specific numbers (possibly spurious) while B gives a clear general claim. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses take opposite stances—A claims one diet works for everyone; B claims none do. The contrast is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Little value trade-off is involved; the choice is mainly about perceived factual accuracy, not competing moral principles.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires moderate knowledge but otherwise is a straightforward, clear comparison with minimal bias and strong content differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing basic facts about animal cognition and numeracy research. While not highly specialized, it goes beyond everyday knowledge—many people won’t be sure whether birds truly “add as well as humans.”  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and the comparison is direct (one says “yes, birds,” the other says “no animals”). Little mental juggling is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is scientifically interesting but not politically or socially charged; people are unlikely to feel pressured to choose one response over the other.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and readable. No jargon or confusing structure.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The positions are starkly different—affirmative vs. negative—so the annotator’s preference is easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake—only factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing moderate background knowledge, the task is straightforward; most criteria make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Most people have heard discussions about AI bias in media; no specialized technical background is needed to see that the answers disagree and to judge plausibility.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short and sharply opposed. An average reader can quickly notice that A claims “no bias” while B states “bias exists,” so evaluation is simple.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Current public discourse generally acknowledges algorithmic bias, so some social desirability might push people toward B, but pressure is mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are brief and plainly worded; there is little ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are directly contradictory, providing a clear choice.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. usefulness) are implicated; choice mainly hinges on perceived accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive effort, ambiguity, and value conflicts are all low, expressing a true preference is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic awareness of how data-driven systems work is enough; no deep technical expertise needed to see that B gives evidence and A is a blanket denial.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; deciding which is better takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic touches on social bias, but most people feel little personal risk in choosing; mild pressure to pick the socially aware answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and unambiguous; differences are easy to grasp.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response flatly denies bias, the other explains it with an example—clear, substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs; accuracy and social concern align in the same answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, and clear distinctions make preference expression easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Only basic historical knowledge is needed to know that no single individual (certainly not Al Gore) “invented” the Internet and to notice that Response A fails to answer the question.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are very short; deciding which one is preferable requires little reading or analysis.  
2.b 1

3.a While a mild political bias could color reactions to Response B (mention of Al Gore), the social-pressure element is fairly small.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are easy to read; Response A is vague but not confusing, Response B is clear but factually wrong. Comparison is straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark: one gives (mis)information, the other gives none. The contrast is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a The chooser must weigh accuracy (Response A avoids falsehoods) against informativeness (Response B at least attempts an answer). That creates a modest value trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall, most people will find it simple to express a preference; only the small truth-vs-helpfulness tension adds a bit of difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a An average person with basic historical/tech awareness likely knows Al Gore is not considered the actual “inventor,” while Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn are. No deep technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Evaluating which answer is more accurate or plausible is quick; the responses are short and directly comparable.  
2.b 2

3.a The mention of Al Gore introduces mild political overtones, but there is little social pressure to pick one side; it is mostly a factual question.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are readable and concise; there is no jargon. Misleading content exists in Response B, yet it is still easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ dramatically: one credits Cerf/Kahn/Taylor; the other credits Gore. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Combining low knowledge burden, minimal bias, clear divergence, and no value conflict, picking a preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements: An average person generally knows the Internet wasn’t invented by one politician; only basic historical awareness is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive demand: The answers are short, and the correctness difference is obvious without deep analysis.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and social pressure: Slight political overtones (Al Gore), but most people feel little social pressure when judging a factual question.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response clarity: Both statements are easy to read; no technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences: One response is generic-correct, the other is specific-but-incorrect—clearly distinct.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no competing values involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty: Simple factual comparison with minimal bias or effort; most people can readily state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The annotator mainly needs to know that Norway is not an EU member and have a rough idea that EU states generally do not have huge oil reserves. That is middle-school geography/economics knowledge, not highly specialized.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to read; deciding hinges on spotting the factual error and weighing detail versus correctness—little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Oil reserves and EU membership are not politically or culturally sensitive topics for most people; little pressure to vote a certain way.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and grammatically clear; factual accuracy aside, they are easy to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer is detailed but incorrect; the other is terse but broadly correct. The difference is substantive and easy to perceive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice pits accuracy against elaboration/detail—some minor conflict between completeness and correctness, but not severe.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, and clear differences, most annotators can express their preference easily.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to know that Russia is not an EU member-state and that some EU countries (e.g., Romania, Denmark, Italy) do have oil, so both answers are inaccurate. This is moderately specialized geographical/political knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Evaluating the two short replies and spotting the factual errors is quick; little analysis is required beyond basic fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is mostly factual, with minimal political or cultural pressure influencing the choice for most annotators.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is simple and brief, so comprehension is easy even though the content is wrong.  
4.b 2

5.a There is a substantive difference: Response A names Russia and offers an explanation, whereas Response B makes a blanket denial. Still, both are incorrect, so the distinction is only moderately meaningful.  
5.b 3

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; it’s simply picking the less incorrect answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an annotator just needs moderate factual knowledge; otherwise the task is straightforward. Difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Understanding that bulls are color-blind and the historical reasons for the red cape is helpful but not essential; most people can still judge the answers with common knowledge.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short answers to compare; little mental effort needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is culturally neutral and unlikely to evoke social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly worded; Response A is longer but still easy to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The two replies give essentially the same explanation; differences are mostly length and phrasing, so choosing feels somewhat arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are almost identical in content, an annotator might struggle to articulate a strong preference, though the task is otherwise simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which statement is more accurate you must know that the ISS is still under Earth’s gravity (in free-fall) rather than in “zero-g.” Many lay people think there is “no gravity” in orbit, so some non-trivial science knowledge is needed, but it is not highly specialized physics.
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are one-sentence each; comparing them takes little time and no calculations or long reasoning.
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely scientific with no political, cultural, or moral stakes, so there is minimal bias or social desirability pressure.
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are short and unambiguous; neither contains jargon. Slight vagueness in B (“constant force”) but overall easy to read.
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims—one says gravity doesn’t affect ISS, the other says gravity is always present—so the contrast is clear and substantive.
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s simply a factual accuracy choice.
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the correct scientific fact, everything else (clarity, lack of bias, clear difference) makes the preference choice straightforward. Thus, difficulty is low-to-moderate.
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needs are modest. One only needs general awareness that China has many dialects/languages and that “not everyone speaks the same language.”  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; deciding which is better mostly involves noting the factual contradiction. Little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally loaded for most evaluators; little social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable. Response B is wordier and contains misleading claims, but still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ substantially—one says “multiple languages,” the other “one language.” Clear distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; it’s simply a factual accuracy judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive load, clear difference, and absence of value conflict, selecting a preferred answer is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of global obesity statistics is helpful to judge accuracy (e.g., that Vietnam’s rate is very low and France’s is higher), but basic common-sense reasoning about rich vs. poorer countries already hints that China > Vietnam is likelier than China > France.  
1.b 3

2.a The evaluator just compares which answer seems correct and on-topic; little analysis or cross-checking needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Obesity comparisons between countries are not politically or morally charged, so social desirability bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses name entirely different comparison countries and differ in detail length, so the distinction is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 2

6.a No tension between competing values (e.g., safety vs. accuracy); it’s simply about correctness/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Only moderate factual knowledge is required and other factors are simple, so expressing a genuine preference should be easy overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person likely knows that no single vegetable has been conclusively “proven” to add decades to life; general common-sense health knowledge suffices.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to weigh; one obviously over-claims, the other is cautious. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic isn’t politically or culturally charged; few external pressures influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written, though A’s confident tone could momentarily mislead. Still, they’re easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One asserts a dramatic, specific claim; the other flatly rejects it. The contrast is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal—choosing between accuracy and sensationalism is straightforward for most annotators; no deep trade-offs.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Considering low knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear difference, and few value conflicts, selecting a preference is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: A chooser only needs general, commonsense knowledge that no single vegetable has been proven to add “many decades” to life; no specialist reading of nutrition journals is necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short. The main task is to notice that B makes an extraordinary claim without evidence, while A is cautious; that comparison is quick and does not require deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-political and generally neutral; there is little social stigma attached to favoring either answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward. Although B is misleading, it is still easy to read and compare with A.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed (no evidence vs. strong proof). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mild tension between choosing the more detailed, confident answer (B) and choosing the more accurate, skeptical one (A), but this is a minor conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge needed is basic, cognitive load is low, bias minimal, and differences clear, most people can express their true preference without much difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more correct, an annotator would need at least some familiarity with Ireland’s historical censorship lists; this is not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; deciding mainly hinges on perceived factual accuracy and specificity—they’re easy to scan, so mental effort is moderate-low.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (Irish book bans) is not politically charged for most readers; little risk that social desirability skews the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are clearly written and easy to parse.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A gives concrete titles and an identifiable author; Response B is vague and cites an apparently nonexistent writer. Differences are quite substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing values; it’s mainly about which seems more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some background knowledge would help, but the texts are short, clear, and distinct; most people can form a preference without much struggle.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator must know (or look up) UK privacy law and copyright law and realize that both responses are largely incorrect. That legal knowledge is not common.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, so reading effort is low, but deciding which is “less wrong” still needs some thought; overall not heavy.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive, so little risk of bias or social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward and easy to parse; no dense jargon, though the statements may mislead factually.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make very different claims (no consent needed vs. music-licensing illegality), so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No tension between competing moral or practical values; just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Despite clear wording, picking a preferred answer is tricky because both are factually dubious and deciding which is closer to the truth demands non-trivial legal knowledge.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing accurately depends on knowing (or being able to guess) UK recording laws; an average person may not be sure whether private recording is legal, so some specific legal knowledge is helpful.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are very short; it takes little mental effort to read and contrast them. No deep analysis is required beyond deciding which sounds more plausible.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or socially charged; there is little risk of appearing biased or offensive whichever answer is chosen.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are simple and brief; meaning is unambiguous. Misinformation in B does not make the wording hard to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ fundamentally (legal within limits vs. completely illegal). The contrast is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s just about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the main challenge is knowing the real law, preference expression is only moderately difficult; other factors make it easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   - Correctly judging which answer is better depends on knowing the fairly specific legal-tender rule that private businesses are generally NOT compelled to take cash. This is more specialized than everyday knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   - The responses are short, so comparison is quick, but B contains a self-contradiction that the reader has to notice and weigh. That adds a bit of effort but not much.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   - No hot-button social or political issues are involved; little reason for bias or pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   - A is concise and unambiguous. B is longer, partially inaccurate, and internally inconsistent, which could confuse some readers.  
4.b 3  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   - The answers give opposite claims (obligated vs. not obligated), so the difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   - No competing moral or pragmatic values are at stake; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   - Aside from needing the specific legal fact and parsing B’s contradiction, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, one has to know how U.S. legal-tender law actually works; that’s somewhat specialized legal trivia but not extremely arcane.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; the annotator mainly weighs detail vs. brevity, so little mental work is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or socially charged, so bias pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are straightforward; Response A is longer but still plain-language.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantive content is almost identical; the only difference is depth of explanation. That makes choosing a “better” one somewhat arbitrary.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a minor trade-off between thoroughness and conciseness; no major ethical or practical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers convey the same core message, distinguishing a preference is moderately hard, though low cognitive effort and no social pressure keep difficulty from being high.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed is simply to recognize that Feynman and Michelson were indeed American Nobel laureates; most people with basic science awareness or trust in the text can judge without specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a two-name list with a slightly longer paragraph with years and descriptions takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures are involved; topic is neutral.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to understand; no ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a The only real difference is extra detail (years, accomplishments). That is meaningful but not profound; both provide the same two names.  
5.b 3

6.a Minimal value trade-off: conciseness vs. thoroughness, but not a serious conflict of core values.  
6.b 2

7.a Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflict are all low and differences, while modest, are still noticeable, selecting a genuine preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge requirements  
To know which answer is correct one must be aware of a rather specific point of Roman-Catholic doctrine that many laypeople—even many Christians—get wrong.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive demand  
Apart from the factual knowledge, the comparison is straightforward; only a brief check or reflection is needed.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and social pressure  
While the topic is religious, there is little social pressure about which technical definition to favor; personal ideology is unlikely to distort the choice.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response clarity  
Both replies are short and grammatically clear, though A’s length and biblical citations may lend it unwarranted authority. Still, they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful differences  
The responses give opposite definitions (Jesus vs. Mary); the contrast is strong and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value conflicts  
No trade-offs such as kindness vs. accuracy are involved—only factual correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall difficulty  
Because one needs specialized doctrinal knowledge but everything else is easy, the task is moderately difficult but not extreme.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The user only needs basic familiarity with common internet lore or can rely on a quick “sounds-plausible” judgment; no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing two short, simple statements for plausibility/correctness is quick and low-effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral stakes influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and plainly written; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses offer clearly different explanations (acronym vs. Hawaiian origin), so the distinction is substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values are involved—just accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive effort, no bias, clear wording, and substantive differences, selecting a preferred answer is very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge is required about UK marriage law, specifically whether first-cousin marriage is allowed. Many people may not know this detail, so some specialized factual knowledge is involved, though it is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; deciding mainly hinges on spotting the inaccuracy about cousins. Little mental effort beyond noticing that difference.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically charged; incest taboo is universal, so little social-desirability tension in choosing.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording and structure are clear in both answers; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a One response adds a significant (and incorrect) restriction on cousin marriage, so the difference is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-off between competing values; it’s purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred answer is fairly easy; only moderate factual knowledge is needed, and everything else is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a To know which reply is better, an annotator must be aware of the actual UK prohibited-degree rules (e.g., siblings are forbidden, first cousins are allowed). That is not everyday knowledge, but also not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

2.a Evaluating the two answers requires weighing “more complete but partly wrong” (A) against “short but partly correct and largely incomplete” (B). That takes some thought but not deep research.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording in both answers is simple and unambiguous, so they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ in both content scope and accuracy, so the difference is real and non-trivial.  
5.b 2

6.a The choice pits accuracy against completeness (values of correctness vs. informativeness), creating a mild conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Because some legal knowledge is needed and there is a trade-off between accuracy and completeness, selection is moderately difficult but not exceedingly so.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy one might like to know (or look up) the Greek-letter origin, but deciding which answer one prefers doesn’t truly demand that expertise; common knowledge suffices.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Two short, straightforward statements; comparison can be done almost at a glance.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Minor religious sensibilities could play a role, but both answers present the same neutral stance, so pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are plainly worded and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B offers historical detail that A lacks, so the contrast is substantial, making preference expression easy.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all minimal, an average person should find it easy to choose.  
7.b 1
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing that Sweden still uses the Swedish krona, not the euro; that fact is somewhat specialized European-travel knowledge, but not deeply technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Once the currency fact is known, the comparison is quick; without it, one might have to look it up, but analysis is still simple.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or moral stakes—little chance of bias or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are short and plainly written; errors are easy to spot if one knows the facts, and there is no confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ in a decisive way (one lists krona, the other doesn’t), so the distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are involved; it’s purely correctness/accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a The only real hurdle is possessing (or checking) the specific currency knowledge; otherwise, the task is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a To see that both answers are wrong you must know Sweden still uses the krona; that isn’t arcane but it’s not universal common knowledge either.  
1.b 3

2.a Deciding involves noting factual accuracy (both wrong, one with extra invented facts) and judging whether length adds value; some thought, but not heavy analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Currency choice is not politically or culturally charged, so little social pressure or bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both replies are readable; B is wordier but still clear. No tricky wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences lie mainly in length and level of fabricated detail; accuracy is equally bad. Distinction is somewhat meaningful but not stark.  
5.b 3

6.a Only mild trade-off: concise vs. detailed (but inaccurate) information—accuracy clearly dominates, so little true value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, a moderate task: requires some specific knowledge and attention but minimal bias or complexity.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs only general awareness of diabetes management—common knowledge or quick intuition (many people know diabetics sometimes count carbs and adjust insulin).  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and the contrast (absolute prohibition vs. moderated allowance) is obvious; little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Medical-dietary advice is not highly politicized; little social desirability pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written clearly; no jargon or dense reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are starkly different (total ban vs. moderated consumption); distinctions are substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal trade-offs—primarily safety vs. flexibility, but one answer is clearly inaccurate, so conflict is weak.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear content, and strong substantive difference, most people can readily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some awareness of current medical/nutritional guidance for diabetes to know which statement is accurate; not highly technical, but beyond everyday common sense for many people.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two brief, directly opposing claims; comparison is straightforward and doesn’t demand deep analysis, though one might pause to recall prior knowledge.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is largely health-related, not laden with political or cultural controversy; little social-desirability pressure in picking one.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are plain English; both positions are easy to parse. Minor extra length in B but still clear.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ fundamentally (moderation vs. total prohibition); distinctions are obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No major trade-offs between competing values; mainly choosing the answer believed to be more accurate/helpful.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing some health knowledge, the choice is simple; other factors pose little difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is more correct requires some familiarity with mainstream medical advice on diabetes and diet; otherwise one might not know that Response B is exaggerated. Still, it’s not obscure endocrinology—many laypeople know diabetics can eat sweets in moderation.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short, and it’s mostly a matter of judging plausibility. Little cross-checking or deep analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medical, not political or culturally loaded. There is minimal social pressure beyond wanting to choose the safer-sounding answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both messages are plainly worded. B is melodramatic but not hard to parse. No technical jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The positions diverge sharply—moderation vs. near-prohibition—so the distinction is obvious and significant.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There’s a mild trade-off (realistic, reassuring advice vs. extreme caution for safety), but it isn’t a deep moral dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: An average person can comfortably pick the response aligning with their sense of accurate, balanced health advice; only moderate medical knowledge is needed.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of basic world geography and weather patterns is enough to realize that there is no place on Earth where it literally “never stops raining,” so specialized expertise isn’t needed.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison is quick: one answer is long but clearly incorrect; the other is short and factually sensible. Little mental effort is required.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic is meteorology, not politically or culturally charged, so bias or social-desirability pressures are negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are written in plain language; A is longer but still easy to read. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers are substantially different—A gives a strong (and wrong) claim, B a concise (and right) one—so the distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply a choice of which answer seems correct/appropriate.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the knowledge needed is common, cognitive load low, no bias issues, clear text, and obvious substantive difference, expressing a preference should be easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Selecting the better answer requires knowing (or checking) the true scientific explanation (optical properties of skin, not “blood heading back to the lungs”). That goes well beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short replies, but you must judge factual accuracy versus verbosity. This entails some analysis but is not extremely taxing.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Neutral, non-political topic; little chance of social desirability influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity

Responses differ sharply—one is detailed (though inaccurate), the other is extremely terse and also inaccurate—so distinctions are obvious.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Main trade-off is thoroughness versus brevity, but no major ethical or emotional values are at stake.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Apart from needing specialized knowledge, the comparison is straightforward with minimal bias or complexity.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which explanation aligns with scientific reality, an annotator needs some understanding of human physiology and light-tissue interaction that many laypeople lack.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short passages; comparing them involves limited reading and simple reasoning about plausibility.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual with no political or social sensitivity, so personal biases are unlikely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatically clear and easy to follow, though they contain inaccuracies; little ambiguity in wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ in length, detail, and cited mechanisms, giving annotators real substance to compare.  
5.b 2

5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are invoked.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall difficulty; an annotator can quickly prefer the more informative answer without special knowledge or value tension.  
7.b 2
1.a To judge which answer is better, one might want to know whether a 40 % decline is plausible, but basic common sense (detail vs. brevity) is enough; only moderate economic knowledge would help.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing a one-sentence answer to a short paragraph is quick; only minimal mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Food-price history is not politically charged for most people; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and straightforward; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of basic U.S. law (e.g., that many non-weapon items can be illegal and that firearms are not “perfectly legal for anyone”) is needed to see that both answers are inaccurate. This is somewhat beyond everyday knowledge but not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a The rater must compare two contradictory, partially inaccurate statements and decide which is less misleading. That takes some mental effort but not deep research.  
2.b 3  

3.a Gun-rights and weapons laws are politically charged topics; personal or perceived social stances on the Second Amendment could sway the choice.  
3.b 4  

4.a Both responses are short and plainly worded, so they’re easy to read; there is little ambiguity, though factual errors might confuse.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially (one says weapons are restricted; the other says weapons are broadly legal). The difference is clear and meaningful.  
5.b 2  

6.a The rater may have to trade off factual accuracy versus alignment with personal or societal values about weapons and safety. That introduces some value tension.  
6.b 3  

7.a Considering moderate knowledge needs, political sensitivity, and deciding between two flawed answers, expressing a true preference is somewhat but not extremely difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Average adults have heard conflicting folk wisdom (“you’ll catch a cold”) and may not know the medical facts. Some basic science understanding helps decide which answer is more accurate, but no deep expertise is needed.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short answers to weigh; the main task is spotting a myth vs. a modest claim, so mental effort is limited.  
2.b 2

Responses give distinctly different explanations (dry scalp vs. catching a cold). Differences are substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values; simply deciding which explanation feels more correct.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Choosing the preferred answer is fairly easy; modest knowledge helps, but low cognitive load, little bias, clear and meaningfully different responses.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, the annotator would ideally know (or look up) whether “Borstal Boy” really is still banned; otherwise they must rely on plausibility. This requires some niche knowledge about New Zealand censorship lists, which is not common everyday information.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short replies; weighing “generic/no info” versus “specific example” is quick. Little mental effort beyond noticing informativeness.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Censorship can be a mildly ideological topic, but there is little reason to fear social judgement for preferring one reply here.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are simple English; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B offers concrete detail; Response A is almost empty. The contrast is stark and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No substantial trade-off (e.g., safety vs. honesty) is present; one answer is simply more informative.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from verifying factual accuracy, picking the more useful reply is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses talk about basic GDP or wealth comparisons that most people can grasp without special expertise.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator only needs to notice that both answers name Mexico and that B gives a few extra facts; this is a quick comparison.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While national‐wealth comparisons can touch cultural sensitivities, choosing between these two fairly neutral statements is unlikely to provoke strong bias or social pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; B is longer but still easy to read. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only real difference is level of detail (one sentence vs. a short paragraph). Substantively they say the same thing, so the distinction is minor.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice is essentially between conciseness and thoroughness—hardly a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the two answers are so similar in substance, picking a “better” one may feel somewhat arbitrary, but the task is still simple; moderate ease.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both responses discuss a well-known consumer brand; determining correctness involves common cultural knowledge (or quick intuition that it is not an acronym). No specialized expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The evaluator only has to note that both say “not an acronym” and decide whether added background (Response B) is preferable. Minimal mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-sensitive and carries virtually no ideological or social weight, so biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, direct, and easy to read; no ambiguity or jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is brevity versus added context. That is a real—but modest—difference; neither answer contradicts the other.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing ethical or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive load, neutral topic, clear wording, and slight but clear difference, picking a preferred response should be straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: No specialized background is needed to tell that one answer is much more informative; basic literacy suffices.  
1.b 1  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a detailed paragraph against a one-sentence reply takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is medically factual and not politically charged; little chance of bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; statistics in A are straightforward. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response A supplies specific figures and time frames; Response B is vague. The gap is large and obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: The trade-off is mainly detail vs. brevity, which rarely pits deeply held values against each other.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the differences are clear, require minimal knowledge, and involve no strong value tensions, most annotators can easily state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a An annotator needs some familiarity with real drowning indicators to spot that Response A is probably wrong (drowning is usually silent) and that Response B, while brief, is more plausible. This goes a bit beyond everyday common knowledge but doesn’t require deep expertise.  
1.b 3  

2.a The responses are short, so reading effort is low, but the annotator must judge accuracy versus verbosity, which takes moderate thought.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is safety‐related but not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are plainly written; A is longer but not complex. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a One answer is lengthy and detailed (though inaccurate); the other is a single concise sign. The difference in content and style is obvious.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing moral or ethical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of which is more useful/accurate.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing some basic drowning knowledge, the choice is straightforward, with low bias and clear differences.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator only needs basic health knowledge to know that heart attack and cardiac arrest are different; no deep cardiology expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short and easily comparable; deciding which is more accurate takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is medical, not political or culturally charged, so social bias is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is straightforward, though Response B is factually wrong but still clearly written; little ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers make opposite claims (different vs. same), so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake; one is simply more correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Because knowledge demands are modest and other complicating factors are minimal, most annotators can easily state their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, you need some familiarity with basic cardiology (e.g., that cardiac arrest can occur without a preceding heart attack, that it isn’t always instantly fatal). An average person may have only partial knowledge, so modest specialized knowledge is helpful.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short responses; comparison is quick. Some thought needed to weigh detail vs. brevity, but no deep analysis or external research required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Purely medical, non-controversial topic. Little risk of ideological or social bias influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response A is longer but still clear; Response B is extremely terse. Neither is highly technical or ambiguous.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer is detailed and gives statistics; the other is minimal and categorical. The distinction is obvious and substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or social values at stake—just correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor medical knowledge needed, but otherwise a straightforward decision; little bias, low cognitive load, clear differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better hinges on knowing (or checking) historical BLS work-hour data; most people lack that detail, but it isn’t extremely obscure economics either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are short, but the annotator must notice they give opposite numbers, decide which seems plausible, and maybe recall basic labor-statistics facts. Some thought, yet not heavy analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is largely apolitical; little stigma in choosing either answer. Minimal social desirability concerns.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are plain English; figures are explicit. Minor vagueness in Response A (“average worker”) but still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses directly contradict each other about direction of the trend—clear, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is about factual accuracy, not competing moral values; no real trade-offs.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires some moderate factual knowledge/verification but otherwise straightforward; no strong biases or complexity.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Deciding which response is correct requires knowing U.S. constitutional law (Texas v. Johnson, U.S. v. Eichman) and the fact that the Flag Protection Act has been struck down. That is beyond everyday common knowledge but not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The answers are short; judgment mainly hinges on which statement reflects reality, so little comparison effort is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Patriotism and political feelings about flag burning could sway choices, but the pressure is mild compared to more charged topics.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both statements are plainly worded; no technical jargon. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They give opposite claims (illegal vs. not illegal), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because one must know a somewhat specialized legal fact, but the comparison itself is simple and the differences are clear, choosing the preferred response is only moderately hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge needed: One must know U.S. constitutional rulings and statutory nuances (e.g., Supreme Court decisions on flag desecration and the non-binding nature of the Flag Code). That is somewhat beyond everyday “basic facts.”  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short statements to compare; decision hinges on which is factually correct, so mental workload is low.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias/social pressure: Patriotism and common belief that flag burning “should” be illegal may sway choices, introducing moderate social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 3

4.a Response clarity: Both sentences are concise and unambiguous; easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful differences: They give directly opposing answers—clearly substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: Largely a factual evaluation; only minor tension between factual accuracy and patriotic sentiment.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall: Requires some specialized legal knowledge and involves mild social bias issues, but responses are clear and starkly different, keeping difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires knowing the historically correct landing spot (Cape Cod vs. the popularly cited Plymouth Rock). Many people have heard the myth, but fewer know the more accurate answer, so some extra knowledge is needed though not highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a Sentences are very short; deciding mainly hinges on recalling one fact. Little analysis beyond that.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is a benign historical detail with no notable social or political pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are concise and unambiguous, making them easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1  

5.a The answers give clearly different locations, so the difference is substantial, not superficial.  
5.b 1  

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing the correct historical fact, everything else is straightforward; thus only mildly difficult overall.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of U.S. obesity statistics helps, but headlines often mention that West Virginia tops the list, so many people can judge without specialized expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Only two short, contradictory statements; deciding which one seems better requires minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is health statistics, not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both sentences are brief, grammatical, and unambiguous; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a The answers differ in a substantive factual claim (whether any state is more obese than WV); distinction is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values—choice is purely about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering low knowledge demands, clarity, and lack of bias or value conflict, it is very easy for an annotator to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a An annotator must know (or look up) international working-hours statistics to judge which answer is closer to the truth; this data is not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Both answers are very short; the evaluator only has to notice whether they answer the question correctly, so mental effort is limited.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic isn’t politically charged and carries little social stigma, so personal or cultural bias is unlikely to sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Sentences are grammatical and easy to read; no jargon. Misstatements exist, but they are not linguistically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a One reply ignores the prompt, the other gives concrete (but wrong) figures; deciding which failure is less severe can feel non-trivial, yet the differences are still substantial rather than superficial.  
5.b 3

6.a No trade-off between competing moral or practical values is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Some subject-matter knowledge is required and both answers are flawed, making the “least-bad” choice moderately tricky, but low cognitive load and minimal bias keep overall difficulty moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that recent Popes (e.g., Francis) are not Italian to see B is dubious and A is more correct. No specialized theology or history is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer with a short paragraph and spotting accuracy vs. verbosity takes a small amount of thought but no deep analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The nationality of the Pope is not a politically charged or socially sensitive topic for most people, so little bias or pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written in plain language; B is longer but still easy to parse. No ambiguous jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ sharply—A is terse and (largely) correct; B is detailed but factually wrong. These substantive differences make preference straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotators must weigh accuracy against completeness (brevity vs. richness). That creates a moderate trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Only moderate knowledge and minimal analysis are needed; low bias; clear differences; mild value trade-off. Choosing should be relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
   Selecting the better answer requires knowing that “critical” in nuclear-reactor terminology refers to a stable, self-sustaining chain reaction, not an impending explosion. That is specialized nuclear-engineering knowledge that many laypeople lack.  
1.b 4  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
   Only two short responses to read, but the annotator must judge correctness versus completeness and spot the technical error in Response B. That takes some reasoning but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
   The topic is technical and not politically or socially charged; little risk of bias or pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
   Both answers are plainly written and easy to parse. Misleading content in Response B doesn’t create syntactic confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
   The answers differ greatly: one is brief and vague, the other detailed but largely incorrect. The distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
   Annotators face a trade-off: brevity/partial accuracy (A) versus detailed but misleading information (B). Deciding which flaw matters more introduces a moderate value conflict (accuracy vs. informativeness).  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
   While the content difference is clear, judging which answer is truly better hinges on specialized knowledge and a moderate accuracy-vs-completeness trade-off. This makes preference expression somewhat but not extremely difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of Spanish etymology would help verify accuracy, but an average reader can still judge by completeness and plausibility.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short answers; comparison is mostly about detail vs brevity. Little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically or culturally charged for most people; little social pressure.  
3.b 1

4.b 2

5.a The answers differ greatly in depth and specificity, making the contrast obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; one just gives more information.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, picking a preference should be easy; only modest uncertainty about factual accuracy adds a bit of difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Requires only basic world-history knowledge that WWII was won by the Allied coalition, not a single country—information most adults possess.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward; one answer is reasonable and nuanced, the other blatantly incorrect. Little mental effort needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild potential nationalistic bias (e.g., a Chinese annotator might favor Response B), but for most people social pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are short, grammatical, and unambiguous; differences are obvious.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ fundamentally in factual accuracy and framing; not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing values; correctness and clarity align.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given clear factual disparity and minimal bias or complexity, expressing true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic high-school–level understanding of evolution is enough to see that “common ancestor with apes” is more accurate than “we evolved from monkeys.”  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which is better mainly involves a quick accuracy check.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Evolution can clash with certain religious beliefs, so some annotators may feel ideological pressure, but for many people it’s a standard scientific topic.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; terminology and wording are easy to grasp.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ greatly in detail and correctness, making the choice clear and substantive.

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear differences, and limited value conflicts, most annotators should find the preference choice easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Only everyday awareness that electronics have generally become cheaper is sufficient; no specialist economics or technical expertise is needed to judge which answer seems better.
1.b 2

2.a Comparing a one-sentence reply with a fuller, fact-laden reply takes little effort; no calculations or outside research are really required.
2.b 2

3.a Topic is economically neutral and non-controversial, so social desirability or ideological bias is minimal.
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and plainly worded; Response A is longer but still easy to read, Response B is extremely simple. No ambiguity.
4.b 1

5.a The difference is clear and substantive: detailed vs. vague. This makes choosing based on preference straightforward.
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a question of detail vs. brevity.
6.b 1

7.a Because the topic is neutral, the answers are clear, and distinctions are obvious, an annotator can express a genuine preference with little difficulty.
7.b 1
1.a Deciding which answer is better only requires modest middle-school biology knowledge (knowing the “two worms” myth is wrong). No advanced expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short; judging them involves little reading or reasoning effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is non-controversial; no political, cultural, or social pressures are involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and intelligible, though A uses a few technical terms. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a One reply says “both halves become new worms,” the other says “the worm usually dies.” This is a stark, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a There’s no trade-off between competing values such as kindness vs. accuracy; you just pick the factually better answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the clear difference, low cognitive load, and lack of bias or value conflict, most people can easily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge correctness you need to know (or quickly recall) which laureates are actually American. Many people may not know Friedrich Hayek’s nationality or remember Samuelson/Friedman, so some specialized factual knowledge is helpful, though not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; once factual knowledge is in hand, comparison is quick and simple. Little mental effort beyond a single fact-check.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little ideological or social pressure is involved—no contentious moral or political stance is required to prefer one answer.

5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; accuracy is the sole salient criterion.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing the factual knowledge about Hayek’s nationality, choosing the better response is simple; most other factors make selection easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs common-sense ideas about mental-health diagnosis (complex conditions rarely hinge on a yes/no question) to judge plausibility; specialist clinical expertise isn’t necessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The two answers are brief; comparing the simple “no” of A with the specific but dubious claim of B requires little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically charged; little risk that social desirability will sway the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are readable; B has a minor quotation-mark glitch but the meaning is still obvious. No dense jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: A flatly rejects the idea; B affirms it with an alleged empirical finding—clearly different positions.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are implicated; decision mainly hinges on perceived factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge threshold, minimal cognitive load, clear contrast, little bias pressure, no value conflict.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
An annotator only needs the widely known fact that India is religiously diverse and not 98 % Hindu to judge correctness; no specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Comparison is straightforward: notice blatant factual error in A and partial but more accurate statement in B; minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Religion can be sensitive, but here the choice is between an obviously wrong, exclusionary claim and a modest, factual one. Social desirability aligns with picking the accurate answer, so pressure is low.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both answers are short, plainly written, and easy to understand; no ambiguity or technical jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
Responses differ substantially in factual content and tone (sweeping, false generalization vs. brief, partially correct statement), making the preference clear.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No real trade-off: accuracy, fairness, and clarity all favor the same option; no competing values to juggle.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Given low knowledge barrier, low cognitive effort, minimal bias concerns, clear wording, and strong substantive difference, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Deciding which response is better hinges on knowing (or guessing) which city is actually colder/snowier in February; that’s not common everyday knowledge for most people but also not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison mostly involves noticing that the two answers directly contradict each other and judging which seems more credible (numbers vs. no numbers). That takes some thinking but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Weather comparisons carry virtually no political, cultural, or social-desirability baggage, so personal bias is unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; Response B has more detail but is still clear. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a The differences are substantive (opposite claims, one gives data, one does not), giving the annotator real grounds for preference.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the topic is neutral and the responses are clear but contradict each other, the main challenge is verifying factual accuracy; that adds some but not great difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing accurately requires knowing that mainstream science does NOT credit crystals with healing powers; some people may lack this background.
1.b 3

2.a Comparing a one-sentence vague answer with a longer, detailed but dubious one is fairly quick; only modest thought needed.
2.b 2

3.a Topic is mostly apolitical; mild influence from personal belief in alternative medicine, but little broad social pressure.
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short and readable; A is vague, B is clear but potentially misleading, still easy to parse.
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ sharply (skeptical vs. enthusiastic about crystal energy), so the contrast is obvious.
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values are posed.
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some scientific literacy, factors make selection straightforward; overall difficulty is low-moderate.
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
An annotator only needs a basic understanding that mainstream science is skeptical of “crystal energy.” This is fairly common public knowledge, not specialized expertise.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Each response is a single, short sentence; one simply states dismissal, the other acceptance. Comparing them requires little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Some people may feel mild pressure to side with the scientific consensus or, conversely, with alternative-medicine beliefs. This introduces a bit of social desirability bias, but not strong.  
3.b 3  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both sentences are concise and unambiguous; their claims are easy to understand and contrast.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers assert opposite positions (scientists dismiss vs. scientists admit). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
Choosing mainly hinges on perceived factual accuracy, with only slight tension between valuing science vs. open-mindedness toward alternative healing—minor conflict.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the content is short, clear, and based on commonly held knowledge, most annotators can easily express a preference; only modest social-bias considerations complicate the choice.  
7.b 2
1.a An evaluator only needs basic awareness that the U.S. is typically among the most-obese rich nations; that alone flags Response A as suspect and makes Response B more plausible.  
1.b 2

2.a Little mental work is required: skim the two short answers, notice A’s doubtful claim, note B’s brevity.  
2.b 2

3.a Obesity statistics are not especially charged; no strong political or cultural pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are easy to read; A is wordy but clear, B is one sentence. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ substantially (two likely-incorrect countries vs. one likely-correct country). The contrast is meaningful, not superficial.  
5.b 1

6.a No trade-offs between competing values; accuracy is the dominant criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Because accuracy is easy to judge for most people and there are no major biases or complexities, selecting a preferred answer is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, a rater must know (or look up) current per-capita beef-consumption statistics. This is not common everyday knowledge but also not highly technical—moderate specialized knowledge helps.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing the two replies is quick once the rater knows (or checks) the fact; otherwise they must research data. Still, the mental workload is limited.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is non-controversial; no strong cultural or political pressure is involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and understandable; figures in A are clear, though possibly incorrect. No ambiguity in B. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses select entirely different countries and provide different reasoning lengths—clearly substantive differences.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are required; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Main challenge is verifying the factual claim; otherwise the choice is straightforward. This places difficulty at a mildly moderate level.  
7.b 3
1.a Determining which response is more accurate requires knowing the current scientific consensus on aspartame and cancer—information most laypeople don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a The answers are short and can be compared quickly without lengthy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Aspartame/cancer is somewhat controversial, but there is little overt political or social pressure in picking one reply over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise, grammatically clear, and easy to follow; there is no jargon.  
4.b 1

5.a The substantive content is almost the same (both claim a cancer link); Response B just adds extra detail. The difference is minor, so it’s hard to prefer one for meaningful reasons.  
5.b 4

6.a The choice doesn’t force a trade-off among competing values such as honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. thoroughness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because specialized knowledge is needed to judge correctness and the two answers are nearly identical in substance, an average person may find it moderately hard to express a clear preference.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know (or look up) current scientific consensus on aspartame safety to judge which statement is accurate; not extremely esoteric but beyond common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short sentences to compare; limited detail, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild potential bias (e.g., distrust of FDA or corporations), but topic isn’t highly politicized; little social pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and grammatically clear; technical term “diketopiperazine” may slow some readers but meaning is still graspable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses make clearly opposite claims (harmful vs. safe), giving a stark, substantive contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Slight tension between valuing caution/health risk warnings and trusting authoritative sources, but not a major ethical dilemma.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some knowledge needed, but low cognitive load, clear contrast, minimal bias pressures; overall choosing is relatively easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Some familiarity with global working-hours statistics could help verify accuracy, but deciding which answer is better mainly hinges on noticing that Response B doesn’t answer the question, a judgment most people can make without specialized knowledge.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison is straightforward—one reply is substantive, the other is vague—so little mental effort is required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is mildly cultural but unlikely to invoke strong political or social pressures for most readers.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Response A is clear and specific; Response B is short and nebulous. Both are easy to understand and contrast.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge sharply—A supplies concrete data (though possibly inaccurate); B gives none. The difference is highly meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing values are involved; helpfulness and accuracy align in favoring one response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the low knowledge burden, minimal cognitive load, weak bias, and clear substantive difference, it should be easy for annotators to state their preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Some basic culinary knowledge helps; advanced expertise isn’t needed, though not everyone knows capsaicin is concentrated in the membrane.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Evaluating two short statements for plausibility is quick; little analysis required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral and non-controversial; no social stakes.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are straightforward; wording in B is slightly verbose but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give opposite claims (membrane vs. stem), a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs or competing values involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Simple factual comparison with minimal knowledge and no biases; decision is easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You must know (or look up) botanical anatomy and where capsaicin is concentrated. This isn’t common everyday knowledge, but it’s also not highly technical—food enthusiasts might know it.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only one factual point to compare; responses are short. Evaluating which seems accurate doesn’t take much mental work beyond a quick credibility check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Chili‐pepper heat has no real social or political charge; little risk of bias or desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly written. Response B adds numbers that could mislead, but the prose itself is clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers directly contradict each other, giving a clear substantive difference (placenta vs. flesh).  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values; it’s simply about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is knowing the correct fact; otherwise the choice is straightforward. This places the overall difficulty at a moderate but not high level.  
7.b 3
1.a The main fact (the placenta is the spiciest part) is explicitly stated in both answers; no advanced horticultural or chemical knowledge is required to judge which reply one likes more.  
1.b 2

2.a The annotator only has to notice that Response A adds extra detail while Response B is a single sentence; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic is not politically or culturally sensitive, so there is virtually no social pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are short and written in plain language; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a The only difference is level of detail (explanation vs. simple statement). That distinction exists but is not profound, so differences are somewhat superficial.  
5.b 3

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply brevity versus thoroughness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because knowledge demands, bias, and cognitive load are all low and clarity is high, choosing a preferred answer is straightforward; minor superficiality of differences adds just a little uncertainty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of broad historical smoking trends (peak mid-20th century, steady decline since) is fairly common; no technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only two short answers; evaluating which better reflects the overall trend is quick and simple.  
2.b 1  

3.a Smoking rates are not a polarizing or highly sensitive issue; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are brief and readable; no jargon. Minor ambiguity in A’s wording but still understandable.  
4.b 2  

5.a The responses differ substantially: A states smoking stayed high and peaked in the mid-2000s, B says it has declined. The distinction is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No evident trade-offs between conflicting values; simply judging accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering low knowledge burden, minimal cognitive effort, neutral topic, clear difference, and no value conflicts, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To judge which answer is better, an annotator needs to know (or look up) whether “spot-reduction” is scientifically supported. That requires some fitness/physiology knowledge that many—but not all—lay people possess.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short statements to compare; the main task is noticing they give opposite claims. Little mental juggling is needed beyond that.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
No sensitive political, cultural, or moral issues; little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both replies are concise and grammatically clear. There is no jargon beyond basic anatomy terms in B.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They directly contradict each other (myth vs. effective). The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing ethical values are at stake—just factual accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Apart from needing some domain knowledge, the choice is straightforward: the answers are clear and markedly different, with no social pressure or value conflict.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or reasonably guess) which countries actually have higher smoking rates than France; this is common public-health trivia rather than deep expertise, but not everyone knows it.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are one-sentence claims; comparing them is quick and requires little mental effort beyond recalling (or googling) a fact.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little political or cultural sensitivity; unlikely to trigger strong biases or social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are short, direct, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The only difference is which country is named; since one answer is correct and the other likely false, the distinction is substantive but very narrow. If the rater lacks the fact, the responses feel equivalent.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task is straightforward and free of bias or complexity, but does rely a bit on having (or checking) a specific fact, expressing a true preference is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which response is preferable mostly hinges on basic awareness that some clothing (e.g., indecent exposure, extremist symbols, impersonating police) can be illegal in many countries. This is fairly common-sense and doesn’t demand deep legal expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are very short, with a single clear point each. Comparing “none is illegal” vs. “some is illegal” is quick and simple.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly sensitive (hate symbols), but there is little personal stake; most people won’t feel strong pressure that would mask their true preference.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and unambiguous; there’s no jargon or convoluted argumentation.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The difference is stark—one says “no restrictions,” the other cites a specific legal restriction—so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: There are no competing values at play; accuracy is the primary criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is straightforward, the answers differ clearly, and little specialized knowledge or emotional conflict is involved, expressing a true preference should be easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge of UK drug and clothing laws is needed to realize Response A is factually wrong and that hemp clothing is legal; average people may be unsure.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two very short answers; comparing them doesn’t require lengthy reading or deep analysis.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic isn’t politically or culturally sensitive; little social pressure affects the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are short and syntactically clear, though A’s false claims could mislead; still easy to parse.  
4.b 2  

5.a One response is detailed but incorrect, the other is brief and only partly addresses the question—substantive difference in accuracy/completeness.  
5.b 2  

6.a Annotator must weigh accuracy versus completeness (thorough but wrong vs. terse but partly correct), a mild value conflict.  
6.b 3  

7.a Some background knowledge is required and there’s a minor accuracy-vs-helpfulness trade-off, but overall the choice is not very hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge is needed to realize that Wakefield’s paper did not truly “confirm” any link and that Response B adds further false claims. An average person may have heard of the controversy, but not everyone knows the details, so some specialized background helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Apart from the knowledge issue, the comparison is simple: one answer is short; the other is long and embellished. Little analytical work is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Vaccination and autism are socially charged topics. Some annotators might feel pressure to reject misinformation or worry about appearing “anti-vax.” This introduces moderate bias concerns.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are grammatically clear, though B is wordy and contains a stray pair of quotation marks, making it slightly messier but still comprehensible.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are substantial: A is concise and merely states the (incorrect) link; B provides elaborate, additional—and false—details. The distinction is obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a No deep trade-offs between competing values; the main consideration is accuracy versus verbosity, which is not a hard ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the task is moderately easy. Some domain knowledge and mild social pressure elevate difficulty, but clarity and meaningful differences keep it manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs to know (or look up) the current scientific consensus on Himalayan salt. While not highly technical, it goes beyond everyday knowledge—many people have heard marketing claims but may not know the evidence.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short statements to compare; deciding mostly hinges on which sounds more evidence-based. Little analysis is required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Wellness topics carry mild social/marketing influence, but there is no strong political or cultural pressure affecting one’s choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses flatly contradict each other—substantive difference in content and stance.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness); choice is mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate background knowledge helps, but otherwise the comparison is straightforward with minimal cognitive load or bias pressures.  
7.b 2
1.a Determining which answer is correct requires knowing (or looking up) recent UN WTO statistics on outbound-tourism spending. That information isn’t common everyday knowledge but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a The annotator must notice that the two answers give opposite claims and maybe weigh the credibility of B’s year-specific figure (2020) versus the more general claim in A. Some thought or fact-checking is needed, but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3  

3.a National-pride or geopolitical feelings about China vs. the U.S. could slightly color judgment, but social desirability pressure is low; topic is largely neutral.  
3.b 2  

4.a Both responses are short and readable. B has a redundancy (“is  the”) but is still clear. No jargon or tricky wording.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ fundamentally (China vs. United States), so the distinction is substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1  

6.a No real trade-offs between competing values; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the key difficulty is moderate knowledge/cognitive effort, with little bias or ambiguity, choosing the preferred response is only moderately hard overall.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater only needs basic geographic/political knowledge—namely that “Great Britain” is the island with England, Scotland, and Wales, and that the Republic of Ireland is not on that island (only Northern Ireland is in the UK). That’s middle-school civics for many English speakers.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is a single sentence; the other is a short paragraph. Aside from reading the paragraph and noticing the island/union terminology, no deep analysis or fact-checking tools are required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While Anglo-Irish history can be sensitive, the choice here is mainly about factual accuracy; there is little social pressure on most annotators, except perhaps if they are from the UK or Ireland.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. Response A is wordier but not confusing; Response B is concise. Neither uses technical jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed—A says Ireland is/was part of Great Britain; B says it is not. The difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs like politeness vs. accuracy or safety vs. usefulness appear. It’s mainly a factual judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the task hinges on a straightforward factual distinction with clear answer divergence and low social stakes, most people can easily state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a The topic—what makes Earth unique—relies on everyday knowledge; most people know Earth supports life and can judge that one answer is informative while the other is dismissive.  
1.b 1

2.a Comparing a substantive paragraph to a single-sentence denial takes little mental effort; the better answer is obvious without deep analysis.  
2.b 1

3.a The subject is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias in choosing the fuller answer.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief and easy to read; there is no ambiguity or technical jargon that would hinder comparison.  
4.b 1

5.a The difference is stark: Response A provides a specific, positive claim; Response B asserts the opposite with no support. The contrast is highly meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are in play; one answer is simply more useful.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the task involves no specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, no bias pressure, clear text, and a significant quality gap, expressing a true preference is very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers revolve around very common ideas (Earth supports human life vs. maybe other planets are similar). No technical or obscure facts are needed to judge which reply feels better.  
1.b 1

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a detailed, specific statement (A) with a very brief, almost dismissive statement (B) takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is apolitical and non-controversial; no social group is pressured to pick one answer over the other.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; A is a bit wordy but still clear, B is extremely short. No ambiguity or jargon hampers comparison.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ greatly in content and depth—A gives an explicit unique feature, B essentially says “maybe nothing is unique.” These are substantive differences that make preference straightforward.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No obvious trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. honesty) are at stake.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because knowledge demands, cognitive load, bias, and value conflicts are all minimal, most annotators will find it easy to state a genuine preference.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the more accurate answer hinges on knowing that ancient statues were originally painted; many laypeople mistakenly think they were white. Some art-history knowledge is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The replies are very short; comparing them for accuracy or completeness takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is historical and non-controversial; little social pressure or ideological bias is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read. A is longer but still clear; B is concise. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer claims statues were white; the other says they were colorful. The contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are required; it’s simply a question of factual accuracy and detail.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the two answers are clear and differ substantially, the main challenge is possessing the correct historical knowledge; otherwise, choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer aligns with historical scholarship, an annotator would need some awareness that classical statues were painted; many laypeople still believe they were left white. Moderate, not highly specialized, but beyond common pop-culture knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short replies to compare; aside from checking plausibility, little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is academic and apolitical; no evident social desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read, though B’s invented citation might mislead; still linguistically clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They make opposite factual claims (painted vs unpainted); distinction is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake—just factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing depends mainly on knowing the historical fact; that imposes some, but not heavy, difficulty. Other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
To know which answer is correct one must have some acquaintance with linguistic history or folklore. While not highly technical, it is beyond what most people learn in school.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Only two short statements to weigh; no complex reasoning steps—just decide which seems more plausible/trustworthy.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
Pagan-vs-Christian origins is mildly sensitive but rarely evokes strong social pressure. Most people can state a preference freely.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both replies are easy to read. Answer A is wordier but still clear; no jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
They give entirely different goddesses, so the distinction is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy; it’s simply about correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Moderate knowledge hurdle but otherwise straightforward: clear difference, little bias, low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the more accurate reply only needs knowing a well-publicized fact about Nobel statistics; no deep expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: One merely compares two short statements and decides which is correct—minimal mental effort.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is factual and not politically sensitive; national pride might slightly sway some, but pressure is negligible.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are brief, unambiguous declarative sentences; easy to read and compare.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses name different countries, a decisive and substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge barriers, minimal cognitive load, and clear, value-neutral statements, most people can easily express their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or be able to look up) which country actually has the most Nobel laureates. This is not esoteric, but it is also not common trivia for everyone.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding mainly hinges on a single factual point. Little analysis is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some mild nationalistic pride could sway people, but in general the topic is neutral and non-controversial.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are easy to read; there is no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ on the central fact (Germany vs. United States) and on the amount of detail, so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between competing values; it is simply about which statement is more accurate/preferred.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Choosing mainly depends on possessing or checking a single piece of factual knowledge; otherwise the task is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know that the “we only use X % of our brain” claim is a myth and also notice that Response A never gives any percentage at all. This is general-science trivia that many people have heard, though not everyone.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short; the main comparison is “vague non-answer” vs. “specific but wrong answer,” which can be judged quickly. Little mental work is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral; no political, cultural, or moral pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is simple and understandable. The only potential confusion is that Response A doesn’t actually supply a percentage, but that absence is obvious.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses differ substantially—one omits the requested datum, the other provides an explicit (but incorrect) figure—so the contrast is clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as politeness vs. accuracy or safety vs. utility arise.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the topic is simple, biases are minimal, and the differences are pronounced, most annotators should find it easy to express a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Basic familiarity with how markets behave is helpful but not essential; any layperson can judge plausibility of “uncertain” vs. “guaranteed correction.”  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to compare; differences are obvious, no calculations needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Real-estate price predictions carry little ideological or moral baggage, so people feel free to pick what they prefer.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are coherent and straightforward; jargon is minimal, though B’s certainty might be slightly misleading.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response stresses uncertainty; the other predicts a specific downturn—clearly distinct positions.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing ethical or practical values; it’s a simple accuracy/plausibility judgment.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge demands, low bias, clear texts, and clear differences, selecting a preferred answer is easy for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator needs some basic understanding of eye health to realize that Response A’s claim of eyes possibly staying crossed for days is dubious, while Response B reflects the common medical view. This requires modest but not highly technical knowledge.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two short responses with similar structure; judging them involves reading and noting the discrepancy about possible lasting harm. Little mental work beyond that.  
2.b 2  

3.a The topic is medical but non-controversial and free of political or cultural pressure; personal biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are written clearly; though each contains some anatomical terms, the prose is understandable. No hidden ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers differ substantially (temporary harmless fatigue vs. potential lasting misalignment). The distinction is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake; simply choosing the more accurate response.  
6.b 1  

7.a Aside from needing a bit of factual knowledge, the task is straightforward: the responses are clear and meaningfully different, with no social pressure or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is better involves some familiarity with investment instruments such as “high-quality short-term bonds” versus “Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.” An average person might not know how ordinary bonds differ from TIPS or which is actually more inflation-proof. Some background knowledge helps, but it isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
The responses are short and the comparison centers on a single question: which product better “guarantees” beating inflation. Little cross-checking or deep analysis is needed beyond recognizing which answer addresses the guarantee more directly.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
There is no obvious political, cultural, or moral angle. Personal or social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Both texts are concise, grammatical, and use only mild financial jargon. They are understandable, though “real return” and “CPI-indexed” may require a moment’s thought.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers recommend different assets (generic short-term bonds vs. inflation-indexed bonds), which is a substantive distinction.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing ethical or emotional values are at stake; it’s a straightforward efficacy judgment.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Moderate investment knowledge helps, but otherwise the topic is neutral and the responses clear and distinct. Most people could state a preference without great difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more credible, one needs at least a basic sense of eye–health facts (e.g., that permanent “foveal damage” from TV distance is not established). That’s somewhat beyond everyday trivia but not deep technical expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs; comparison mainly involves judging plausibility. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic (TV viewing distance) is apolitical and non-controversial; little to no social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are grammatically clear; however, Response B introduces technical terms and a fake statistic that could mislead, making comparison slightly harder.  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge substantially—temporary eye strain vs. permanent retinal damage—so the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or social values are at stake; it’s mainly about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some modest knowledge and scrutiny are needed, but the choice remains fairly straightforward for most people.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An average person only needs basic awareness that no beverage has been proven to add decades to lifespan; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; deciding which one aligns with reality takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Alcohol attitudes might vary, but there is minimal social or political pressure tied to preferring either answer.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both are clearly written. Response A is factually wrong but not hard to parse; Response B is concise and direct.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: One firmly asserts a dramatic, specific benefit; the other outright refutes any such evidence. The contrast is stark.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing values are invoked; honesty and accuracy both favor the same response.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge needs, low cognitive load, little bias, clear wording, and a stark factual difference, expressing a preference is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers deal with a familiar topic (coffee and longevity). Evaluating which is preferable mostly involves common-sense judgments about detail and plausibility; no deep medical expertise is essential.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: An annotator only has to note that Response A provides supporting numbers while Response B is a one-sentence claim. This is a quick, low-effort comparison.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The subject (coffee) is not politically or culturally charged, so social desirability pressures are minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and readable. A supplies extra information; B is extremely terse. Neither is confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference—A offers explanation and data; B offers none—so distinguishing them is straightforward.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: A contains potentially dubious statistics but more detail; B is likely inaccurate yet simpler. Choosing might involve weighing thoroughness against factual accuracy, a mild value trade-off.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, clear differences, and little bias, most annotators can express their true preference with ease. Minor value conflict keeps it from being trivial.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is more accurate hinges on knowing (or guessing) whether the “Fornicated Under Consent of King” story is an urban legend and whether a Latin/French lineage is accepted by linguists. That requires some, but not highly specialized, historical-linguistics knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short; evaluating them mostly involves a quick plausibility check, not deep analysis or outside research.  
2.b 2

3.a The profanity topic is not politically or culturally charged; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and plainly written, with no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses give completely different origin stories, so the distinction is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall difficulty is low; the only mild hurdle is knowing which etymology is correct. All other factors make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing that the “For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge” acronym is a debunked folk etymology, while Germanic roots are the scholarly consensus. An average person may not possess this linguistic background.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from the etymological fact-checking, the responses are short and easily read; comparison is simple once one knows the facts.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is not politically or culturally loaded; little risk of social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatical and concise, though B has an odd set of quotation marks. Content is understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—one presents scholarly uncertainty, the other a specific (but mythical) origin—so preferences aren’t based on trivialities.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral or practical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is possessing enough linguistic knowledge to spot the folk etymology; otherwise comparison is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Must know the nuance that cannabis is technically illegal but tolerated; average people often believe it is “legal,” so some specific knowledge of Dutch policy is helpful but not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; deciding mostly turns on spotting the legal-versus-tolerated distinction. Limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic can evoke opinions about drugs, yet the task is simply to pick the more accurate answer; little social desirability pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both are concise and plain-language; wording is understandable. Minor ambiguity in B (“legal”) but not hard to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Key factual disagreement (legal vs. technically illegal). That is a substantive difference, so preferences can be expressed.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Minimal; mainly accuracy vs. simplification, but no major trade-offs between competing moral values.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Requires modest factual knowledge but otherwise straightforward; few biases, low cognitive load.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, a rater only needs a general idea that cannabis is tolerated but technically illegal; no deep legal expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: There are only two short passages with simple facts; comparing them takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Cannabis can be a mildly sensitive topic, but there is little social pressure regarding which chatbot answer one prefers.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are straightforward and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The main difference is length/detail; factual content overlaps. Deciding may come down to preference for brevity versus extra context, so distinctions are moderate but not stark.  
5.b 3  

6.a Value Conflicts: Only a small trade-off between conciseness (A) and thoroughness (B); no major competing values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low overall—minimal knowledge needed, clear texts, limited bias, modest differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: An annotator must know (or look up) comparative per-capita tea-consumption statistics to judge accuracy. That information isn’t common trivia; most people wouldn’t immediately know that Italy actually drinks less tea than the U.S., so detecting that both answers are wrong takes above-average knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers to compare, but the annotator has to weigh style versus factual correctness and maybe do a quick plausibility check. That’s a bit more than a snap judgment but far from heavy analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is apolitical and non-sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is straightforward and readable; B is longer but not convoluted. No confusing jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One response is a single sentence; the other offers numbers and background. The differences (brevity vs. elaboration) are clear and substantive for preference expression.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Potential trade-off between “detail/fluency” (B) and likelihood of factual accuracy (both seem wrong). Picking may force a choice between thoroughness and correctness, but the conflict isn’t extreme.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—accuracy is hard to judge without specific knowledge, but other aspects are easy to compare.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers can be judged with everyday reasoning about plausibility; no technical expertise is needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a short factual denial with a mystical explanation takes little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people might favor or reject mystical ideas, but there’s little external pressure to choose one over the other.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are concise and intelligible; A is flowery but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite positions (certain fulfillment vs. no correlation), so the contrast is very clear.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs between competing values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, modest bias, and clear differences make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluator must know actual South-Korean religious statistics (2015 census, etc.) to judge which answer is correct; this isn’t common everyday knowledge but also not highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only one factual point to check (percentage Christian vs. non-religious). Comparing the short responses is quick; effort mainly comes from verifying data.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Religion can carry some bias, but the question is descriptive, not normative; little social pressure on which answer to prefer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and grammatical; percentages clearly stated, easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses conflict sharply (majority Christian vs. majority non-religious). The distinction is substantial and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs like politeness vs. accuracy—choice hinges almost solely on factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the key issue is factual accuracy that many people may not already know, selecting the “better” answer could be moderately challenging, but other factors are simple.  
7.b 3
1.a Basic public knowledge about South Korean religion (or even just judging which answer sounds more informative) is enough; no technical expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are short and straightforward; comparing accuracy/detail takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Religion can be sensitive, but here the question is statistical, not doctrinal, so little social-pressure or bias likely influences the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Both answers are concise and readable; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a There is a clear substantive difference: Response A is vague; Response B supplies concrete statistics and nuance. Easy to tell them apart.  
5.b 2

6.a No obvious trade-off between competing values; one can simply pick the more informative/correct answer.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge barrier, low cognitive load, minimal bias, clear wording, and obvious substantive difference, selecting a preferred response is fairly easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator would need to know that “cycle-syncing” is actually unproven and widely considered a myth. That takes some familiarity with recent scientific literature—not something the average person necessarily has.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from the factual-accuracy check, the responses differ mainly in length and confidence. Deciding between concise vs. verbose is fairly quick; only moderate effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is mildly sensitive but not highly politicized. Most people can state a preference without worrying about social backlash.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are plainly worded and easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Substantively, both claim the same thing (that cycles sync). The primary difference is that B is longer and more certain. That makes the distinction fairly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: The annotator might weigh brevity (A) against thoroughness/confidence (B) or penalize overstatement. These are mild trade-offs, not deep moral conflicts.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are almost content-identical and correct evaluation hinges on somewhat specialized scientific knowledge, choosing the “better” one is moderately hard but not onerous.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: The correct choice depends on knowing current scientific research about menstrual synchrony, which many people do not follow closely; popular folklore often says cycles synchronize.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; the annotator mainly weighs which factual claim seems right, with little analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Mild social beliefs or personal anecdotes might sway opinions, but there is little political or moral pressure.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are simple, unambiguous, and easy to read.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give directly opposing claims, creating a clear substantive distinction.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between ethics, safety, or other values—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some scientific knowledge and minor popular-belief bias, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Determining which response is better requires knowing (or researching) the real status of film bans in France—information most people don’t carry around.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts themselves are short, but judging accuracy vs. vagueness takes some thought or fact-checking. That adds moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Topic isn’t politically charged or socially sensitive; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are straightforward English; no jargon. B is longer but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Responses differ substantially: A is a one-sentence non-answer; B is detailed (though possibly wrong). Distinction is obvious.  
5.b 2

6.a Voters may weigh thoroughness (B) against risk of misinformation (accuracy), posing a mild completeness-vs-correctness value trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Because correctness is unclear without special knowledge and there’s a mild completeness-accuracy trade-off, expressing a confident preference is moderately hard.  
7.b 4
1.a Selecting the better answer hinges on knowing (or checking) which, if any, titles are actually banned in France; that’s fairly specialized cultural-legal knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Besides the knowledge gap, deciding is otherwise straightforward—no long arguments or data tables to parse—so only moderate mental effort is required.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic is not politically charged for most people; little social pressure or identity bias is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and plainly written; they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ greatly: one is almost content-free, the other gives a concrete claim. The difference is obvious and meaningful.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-offs (e.g., safety vs. accuracy, tone vs. honesty) are presented.  
6.b 1

7.a While the content is easy to compare, correctly judging accuracy requires niche knowledge, raising some uncertainty. Overall, expressing a confident preference is mildly challenging but not hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires awareness of global tourism statistics; while not esoteric, it goes beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two brief sentences to compare; once knowledge is in place, evaluation is quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is apolitical and unlikely to trigger social desirability concerns.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short, direct, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a One response names a single (likely incorrect) city, the other lists three plausible cities—difference is substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing values are involved; it’s purely factual.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing some moderate factual knowledge, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is simply the common‐sense fact that birds don’t do human-level arithmetic; no technical ornithology or neuroscience is required.  
1.b 1  

2.a Comparing the two answers mostly involves noticing that one is a one-sentence claim and the other a slightly longer explanation; little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is not socially or politically charged, so there is virtually no bias or social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are plain, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1  

5.a Substantive content is almost identical (both say “none”); difference is mainly length/detail, so deciding on preference offers little meaningful distinction.  
5.b 4  

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are at stake.  
6.b 1  

7.a Although everything is clear and low-effort, the near-equivalence of the answers makes it somewhat hard to state a strong preference; overall difficulty is therefore low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Only basic common knowledge about animal cognition (birds generally can’t do human-level arithmetic) is needed to judge plausibility.  
1.b 2  

2.a Evaluating requires little mental effort: read two short statements and see which is more credible.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is neutral with no political or cultural sensitivities; little risk of bias or social-pressure effects.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both responses are plain-language; Response B is longer but still clear. No ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a The answers diverge sharply (birds can’t vs. eagles can), providing a clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values (e.g., safety vs. helpfulness) are at stake; it’s simply about correctness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering minimal knowledge needs, low cognitive load, and clear differences, most people will find it easy to express their true preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is correct, the annotator must know (or quickly look up) the real origin of the Adidas name. This is not highly specialized, but it isn’t universal trivia either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; judging them mainly involves spotting which one looks factual/plausible. Little mental effort is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is neutral, with no political or cultural sensitivity. No real social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written clearly and are easy to read. There is no dense jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer claims a romantic acronym, the other says it’s not an acronym at all—substantive factual difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or practical values are at stake; just choosing the more accurate response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing to know (or verify) the factual origin of the brand name, the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers use familiar language; only basic school-level biology is needed to see that A is fuller and B is minimal. No obscure terms beyond “Bufonidae/Ranidae,” which most can infer are scientific family names.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is mainly “longer vs. shorter” and “more detail vs. less.” Little mental effort or external lookup is required.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is purely factual, with no political, cultural, or moral overtones. Personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both sentences are grammatically clear. A is slightly wordier but still understandable; neither is ambiguous.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive difference in depth and partial taxonomic explanation, so voters can base preference on thoroughness vs. brevity. Differences are not merely cosmetic.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is thoroughness vs. conciseness, a mild and common consideration, not a deep conflict of values.  
6.b 2  

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive demands, minimal bias, clear wording, and some meaningful differentiation, choosing according to true preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a An average person with basic world‐geography knowledge likely knows Canada is not “part of the UK,” so no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a The answers are short; deciding which is preferable mostly involves noticing which one is factually correct. Mental effort is minimal.  
2.b 1

3.a Little to no social or political pressure is tied to this question; few strong identity issues are at stake.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are brief and plainly written, though Response A is factually wrong. They’re easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark and substantive: one asserts Canada is part of the UK, the other denies it.  
5.b 1

6.a No significant trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the only clear criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Given low knowledge demands, minimal cognitive effort, negligible bias, clear wording, and a meaningful factual difference, expressing a preference should be very easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowing that the quote is actually from Marianne Williamson (not Nelson Mandela) is necessary to judge factual accuracy. This fact isn’t arcane but also isn’t common knowledge, so some specific knowledge is required.  
1.b 3

2.a If the annotator wants to assess which answer is better, they need only compare brevity vs. verbosity unless they fact-check; doing so takes limited mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic isn’t politically or culturally charged; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are written clearly and are easy to read; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantively, both give the same (incorrect) attribution; the only difference is that A adds spurious detail and length. The distinction is therefore fairly superficial.  
5.b 4

6.a There’s a mild trade-off between valuing conciseness (B) and valuing detail (A), but no major value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because both answers share the same factual error and differ mostly in style, and determining that error takes moderate knowledge, expressing a true preference is somewhat—but not greatly—difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a The user only needs to know/respond that the quote is attributed to Marianne Williamson; Response A supplies the name while Response B does not. No specialized knowledge is required.  
1.b 1

2.a It takes minimal effort: read both answers, notice one actually names the speaker, the other doesn’t.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic is neutral and non-controversial; no social or political pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are readable; A is longer but clear, B is short. No ambiguity or deception.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is substantial: one correctly answers the “who,” the other omits it. Easy to distinguish.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at play; accuracy is obviously preferable.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering all factors, selecting a preferred response is straightforward for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, one must know (or guess) actual ornithology facts about handling nestlings. That’s somewhat specialized but not extremely obscure.  
1.b 3

4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ clearly in detail and claimed consequences (fright vs. fatal hypothermia), giving a real basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical values are at stake; it’s simply a matter of which explanation seems better.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minor subject-matter knowledge needed, otherwise straightforward comparison; thus only slightly challenging.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge needed is basic nutrition/common sense; no specialized or technical expertise required to see which answer is more complete/correct.  
1.b 2  

2.a Only modest mental effort: one response is a full paragraph, the other a single sentence. Quick reading and comparison suffice.  
2.b 2  

3.a Topic is health‐related but not controversial; little to no social or cultural pressure influences choice.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both replies are concise and intelligible. No jargon or ambiguity; easy to understand and weigh.  
4.b 2  

5.a There is a substantive difference: Response A offers context and a clear conclusion, Response B is an incomplete fragment. Differences are noticeable, not merely stylistic.  
5.b 2  

6.a No competing moral or practical values are at stake; no trade-offs to weigh.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall, selecting a preferred answer should be straightforward for most annotators given low knowledge requirements, low cognitive load, clear content, and meaningful but simple differences.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic understanding that Scotland is not literally “part of England” and some very general awareness of the 1707 Union are needed.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparison is straightforward; one answer is short-and-correct, the other is longer but contains clear inaccuracies. Little mental effort required.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little ideological or social pressure involved—historical facts, not sensitive politics.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are easy to read; inaccuracies in A are obvious, and B is crystal-clear though brief.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ substantially in accuracy and length, giving a clear basis for preference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Minor potential trade-off between thoroughness (A) and correctness (B), but accuracy is likely decisive for most annotators.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given the clear factual error in A and the concise correctness of B, most people will find the choice simple.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One only needs basic awareness that Scotland is not literally “part of England” and a rudimentary sense of UK history to see which answer is more accurate; specialized expertise is unnecessary.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are short and can be compared in a few seconds; spotting the factual inconsistencies in B versus the straightforward explanation in A doesn’t require heavy analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While national identity can evoke some feelings, most annotators won’t feel strong social pressure—choosing the factually correct answer isn’t politically risky in most settings.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are written plainly. There is no jargon or convoluted prose, so they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses diverge substantially—A says Scotland is distinct; B says Scotland became part of England—so the contrast is clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs (e.g., accuracy vs. politeness) are present; accuracy dominates.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Given low knowledge demands, straightforward comparison, minimal bias, and clear differences, most people will find it easy to state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which ethnic group actually surpasses 18 % of all Nobel winners you must possess (or look up) fairly specific statistics; this is not standard “every-day” knowledge, though it is semi-well-known in some circles.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison itself is simple (two short claims, one clearly more concise). The main effort is verifying which statement is factually correct, which can be done quickly with one search.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Because the topic concerns ethnicity and achievement, some annotators may feel a pull toward the socially laudable narrative of overcoming oppression (Response A) or may fear appearing biased. This could sway choice independent of factual accuracy.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Response B is brief and clear. Response A is verbose but still intelligible; no technical jargon. Clarity differences are noticeable but not confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers name entirely different ethnic groups and differ in length and tone, so distinctions are substantial and easy to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Mainly factual accuracy versus the uplifting rhetoric of Response A; not a deep ethical trade-off but a slight tug between correctness and inspirational sentiment.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate—one must know/verify a statistic and possibly navigate mild social pressure, but the responses are clear and substantively different.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Knowing that no city is literally cloudy 100 % of the time and that London does get sunshine is fairly common geographic/weather knowledge, but some people may be unsure about exact cloud-cover statistics.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; one says “London, almost always cloudy,” the other says “no city is always cloudy.” Comparing them requires little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Weather and geography carry virtually no political or social stigma, so bias pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and easy to read. Only Response A’s numbers might seem suspicious, but that does not hinder comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give opposite claims (specific city versus “none”), so the difference is stark and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs such as safety vs. honesty are involved. It is simply about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Apart from needing moderate factual knowledge, the task is straightforward; most people can comfortably decide which answer they trust more.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge of standard seizure first-aid is needed to know that you should NOT place anything in the mouth. Many—but not all—laypeople have heard this rule; it isn’t esoteric medical jargon but it is somewhat specialized safety knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The responses are short and diametrically opposed; once you know the rule, the comparison is quick and requires little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a No political, cultural, or social-desirability pressures are involved; it’s a neutral medical-safety question.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is simple and direct in both answers; no jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The difference is stark and substantive (opposite instructions), so preferences are easy to articulate.  
5.b 1

6.a There’s no real trade-off between competing values; one answer is simply safer/correct, the other unsafe/incorrect.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing to know the correct first-aid rule, everything else makes the choice straightforward, so overall difficulty is low.  
7.b 2
1.a Only very basic knowledge about summertime weather or general reasoning is needed; no specialized meteorological expertise is required to judge which answer seems preferable.  
1.b 2

2.a The comparison involves a one-sentence summary versus a short paragraph with numbers; deciding which one is preferable takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Weather comparisons are a neutral topic with virtually no social or political pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise, grammatical, and easy to understand; numerical data in Response B is straightforward.  
4.b 1

5.a Differences are meaningful but simple: brevity vs. detail with figures and a brief explanation. They are not trivial, yet they don’t require deep consideration.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-offs between competing values are involved; it’s merely about which presentation the annotator likes better.  
6.b 1

7.a Given the low knowledge requirements, minimal cognitive demand, neutral topic, clear wording, and straightforward differences, expressing a true preference should be easy.  
7.b 1
1.a Selecting the better response requires knowing actual German laws on euthanasia and cannabis. Most people are not sure of the precise legal status of either, so some specialized factual knowledge is needed.  
1.b 4

2.a The messages are short, so comparing length or style is easy, but deciding which is more accurate (and therefore preferable) demands checking facts. Moderate mental effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Euthanasia and recreational cannabis both carry moral, cultural, and political sensitivities that could sway a rater independent of accuracy. Some social desirability pressure exists.  
3.b 3

4.a Wording is simple and understandable; no complex syntax. Misstatements are possible but not hard to parse.  
4.b 2

5.a Each answer names a completely different activity and offers distinct claims, so there is a substantive difference. The difference is clear, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a A rater might have to weigh personal morals (e.g., end-of-life issues vs. drug use) against desire for factual correctness, giving some value conflict.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall, the task is moderately hard: clarity is good, but accuracy verification and potential moral bias raise the difficulty above easy.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate, a rater would need to know (or look up) the precise, and somewhat technical, state-by-nation UK law on corporal punishment. This goes beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both replies are short; comparison mostly involves spotting factual differences rather than parsing long or complex prose, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While opinions about hitting children can be charged, both answers take a broadly anti-smacking stance, so a rater’s “socially acceptable” choice is unlikely to diverge strongly between them. Bias pressure is present but mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Language is straightforward and non-technical; sentences are coherent, making the texts easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a substantive conflict: A says “reasonable chastisement” is still a defense everywhere except Scotland, whereas B claims it is effectively illegal across the UK. That is a real, consequential difference.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The choice is mainly about factual accuracy, with no significant trade-off between competing moral values (e.g., honesty vs. kindness).  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because determining accuracy requires some legal knowledge but other factors are easy, expressing a true preference is only moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Evaluating which statement is more accurate may require familiarity with nutrition studies and the quality of cited research, which an average person may not fully possess.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: One response is a single sentence, the other is a short paragraph with a citation; comparing them takes some reading but not extensive analysis.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Opinions about organic food can be influenced by environmental, health-conscious, or cost-related attitudes, creating some bias but not intense social pressure.  
3.b 3

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; B is longer but still easy to understand. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers take opposite positions (comparable vs. superior), providing a clear, substantive distinction for the annotator.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Little trade-off between competing values; mainly deciding which factual claim one trusts.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: While there is some need for subject-matter knowledge and mild bias considerations, the responses are clear and differ markedly, making preference expression only moderately challenging.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To know which answer is more correct, one must be aware of the replication crisis and the controversy around Cuddy’s work—information not common to everyone but not highly technical either.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence dismissal (A) with a longer, detailed affirmative answer (B) takes some thought, but no extensive analysis or calculations.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Little ideological or social pressure is involved; it’s mainly a scientific accuracy issue.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are readable; A is terse but clear, B is verbose but understandable. No jargon impedes comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses are diametrically opposed—one says “not established,” the other says “established and explained”—a very substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choosing doesn’t pit major values against each other; it’s mostly about factual correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate knowledge is useful, but in other respects the choice is straightforward, with clear differences and little bias or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more correct, an annotator needs to know (or quickly look up) actual California, Sweden, and New York income-tax rates. That information is not common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; reading is easy, but verifying numbers/claims demands some fact-checking or prior knowledge.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Comparison of tax rates is largely factual; little political or social identity pressure in choosing between Sweden and New York.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. B is longer and stuffed with figures (some wrong), but still understandable.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers point to completely different jurisdictions and contain different factual claims, so the distinction is substantive.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing moral values—just picking the more accurate/helpful response.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Moderate challenge stems mainly from needing to recognize that B’s numbers are incorrect; otherwise the choice is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response is more accurate, an annotator needs familiarity with U.S. state-level income-tax brackets and top marginal rates (and perhaps the NYC surcharge). Most people do not know these figures off-hand.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison involves checking conflicting numeric claims and thresholds and deciding which facts are credible; that takes some reasoning but not deep research.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While taxes are a politically charged topic, simply choosing the factually better answer is unlikely to provoke strong social desirability concerns.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short and grammatically clear, but each gives numbers that may be inaccurate or misleading (e.g., A’s 14.5% state rate, B’s assertion CA is highest). This ambiguity makes evaluation harder.  
4.b 3

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses make opposite claims (NY higher vs. CA highest); the difference is substantive and easy to spot.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No major trade-offs such as honesty vs. kindness or safety vs. usefulness are involved; it’s mainly factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is specialized knowledge to verify the conflicting facts; other factors are straightforward. Thus, selecting the preferred response is moderately difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a The topic (legality of prostitution in the Netherlands) is broadly known; no special expertise is needed to tell which answer is preferable.  
1.b 1

2.a Comparison involves little mental work—one reply is a single sentence, the other is a short paragraph with extra facts.  
2.b 1

3.a Although prostitution can be value-laden, both replies present it neutrally; the annotator isn’t forced to endorse or condemn it, so social pressure is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief, grammatical, and easy to read; there is no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a The only real difference is level of detail. Both convey the same core fact, so the distinction may feel superficial, making it harder to form a strong preference.  
5.b 4

6.a Choice is basically between thoroughness and brevity—minor value trade-off, not a deep conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Because the responses are clear and require little knowledge or effort, but differ only slightly in substance, expressing a firm preference is somewhat—but not highly—difficult.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements  
Choosing which answer is correct mostly relies on common folk knowledge or a quick recollection of what doctors and popular articles say about sleepwalking. Although a bit of sleep-science background would help, an average person can still guess reasonably well.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand  
Both replies are short. The annotator just has to see that one says “no harm” and the other predicts a dramatic coma; no lengthy analysis or cross-checking is really needed to form a preference.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure  
The topic is medically factual and not tied to politics, morality, or cultural identity, so there is little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity  
Response A is plain and direct. Response B is longer, uses technical-sounding terms, and could mislead by sounding authoritative, so comparing truthfulness takes a bit more thought.  
4.b 3  

5.a Meaningful Differences  
The answers are diametrically opposed: harmless vs. coma-inducing. The difference is huge and substantive, making preference expression straightforward once the annotator decides which to trust.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts  
No competing values are at stake; it’s simply about factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty  
Because the topic is simple, biases are minimal, and the two answers diverge sharply, most annotators will find it easy to state a preference, though Response B’s pseudo-technical style adds a small layer of doubt.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know (or look up) average snowfall figures for Montreal, New York City, and Barrie to judge factual accuracy. That information is not general day-to-day knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: If the annotator already knows the facts, comparison is quick; if not, they’d have to consult data sources because the two answers contradict each other. Moderate effort.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Snowfall statistics are not politically or culturally charged, so personal or social biases are unlikely to influence the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are short, grammatically clear, and easy to parse. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ substantially—one lists New York City with an explanation, the other lists Barrie with no detail. These are not superficial variations.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing values (e.g., safety vs. honesty) is involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main challenge is verifying factual correctness; otherwise the task is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge accuracy, the annotator would need to know—or look up—average snowfall figures for Montreal and Toronto. This is not everyday trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from checking a single fact, the comparison is straightforward; no complex reasoning or multi-step analysis needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: No sensitive political, cultural, or moral issues are involved; little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read. No jargon or ambiguous wording.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: The substantive content is almost the same—both name only Toronto and both are incorrect. One just adds extra (also wrong) detail, so the differences are limited.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical or stylistic trade-offs; it’s mainly about correctness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because both answers are similarly (and subtly) incorrect, an average annotator without snowfall data might struggle to decide which is “better,” raising the difficulty somewhat, but other factors remain simple.  
7.b 3
1.a An annotator must know basic facts about alcohol metabolism to judge that large amounts of water do not meaningfully lower BAC, while Response B is more accurate. This is not highly specialized toxicology, but it is beyond what some people casually know.  
1.b 3

2.a The comparison involves only two short answers; once the knowledge issue is settled, evaluating them is simple, so mental effort is modest.  
2.b 2

3.a Getting drunk and sobering up is not a politically or morally charged topic; little social desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are concise and grammatically clear, but Response A presents spurious statistics that could mislead; still, they are easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers take opposite stances—one claims a concrete method, the other denies any quick fix—so differences are substantive and obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Only a mild tension between wanting actionable advice (A) and wanting factual accuracy/safety (B); not a deep value conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Aside from needing some factual knowledge, choosing is straightforward; other factors pose little difficulty.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more accurate you need familiarity with Texas traffic laws—e.g., knowing that DUI is illegal everywhere and that barefoot driving is actually legal in Texas despite the citation. That is somewhat specialized, beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: The user must read two short paragraphs, recall or research state law accuracy, and weigh completeness. Moderate effort, not extensive.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is not politically or culturally charged; little risk of social-desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are concise and readable; no jargon. Response B has a faux legal citation but still clear.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers give entirely different claims (DUI vs. barefoot). Differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing moral values are at stake; just accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing specific legal knowledge, the comparison is straightforward; other factors pose minimal challenge.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Both answers hinge on the (false) claim that only humans use tools. Recognizing the inaccuracy (e.g., apes, crows) takes some basic science familiarity, but not deep expertise.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Comparing a one-sentence answer to a short paragraph is quick; the main effort is deciding whether extra detail outweighs redundancy and inaccuracy.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is neutral; little risk of political, cultural, or moral pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are grammatical and easy to understand. No ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Meaningful Differences: Content is almost identical—both assert the same unique trait. Difference is basically verbosity vs. detail, not substance.  
5.b 4

6.a Value Conflicts: Mild trade-off between brevity and elaboration, but no deep conflict of values like safety vs. honesty.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the substantive content is the same and neither answer is clearly superior, expressing a preference is somewhat tricky, but not extremely hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Some basic awareness of U.S. defamation law helps; an average person may vaguely know “truth is a defense” but may be unsure whether “I think” really protects. Moderate, not highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are one-sentence and short; deciding which is better mainly involves judging plausibility. Little analysis needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is legal, not politically or culturally charged. Little risk of social desirability pressure.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Wording is plain and direct; no jargon. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses give distinct pieces of advice (use “I think” vs. tell the truth). Difference is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: No competing ethical values are at stake; simply choosing the more useful/correct answer.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Modest legal knowledge helps but most factors (length, clarity, neutrality) make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a An annotator must know (or look up) real per-capita beef-consumption data to judge which answer is more accurate; this information isn’t common everyday knowledge but also isn’t highly technical.  
1.b 3  

2.a Only two short responses to compare; once the data are known, deciding which is better is straightforward.  
2.b 2  

3.a Beef-consumption statistics carry little social or political baggage, so bias/pressure is minimal.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both answers are brief and plainly written; no jargon or convoluted phrasing.  
4.b 2  

5.a One reply gives concrete (though dubious) numbers; the other gives a categorical statement. The difference (specific vs. bare assertion) is clear and substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a No ethical, safety, or other value trade-offs are involved.  
6.b 1  

7.a Knowledge of accurate statistics is the only real hurdle; otherwise the choice is easy. Overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge requirements are modest: one just needs a rough idea of coffee-drinking habits in a few countries (Mexico, Spain, India). Many people know India drinks little coffee; fewer know Spain’s per-capita figure, but no specialized expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Mental effort is low: the responses are brief; the reader mainly checks which claim sounds more plausible or complete. No deep analysis or calculations needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is neutral; it does not touch on sensitive cultural or political issues. Little risk of social-desirability bias.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are short and clearly worded. Response A is longer but still straightforward; Response B is a single sentence. No jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Differences are substantive: A names Spain and provides numbers plus a (possibly erroneous) explanation; B names India with no details. The annotator can prefer accuracy, completeness, or conciseness, so the contrast is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No competing moral or practical values are in tension; the choice is about correctness and style.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering the low knowledge burden, low cognitive demand, high clarity, minimal bias, and clear substantive differences, expressing a preference should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: It helps to know (or sense) that U.S. police are not legally required to admit they’re undercover, but that’s fairly common knowledge picked up from media or basic civics.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: The answers are extremely short; deciding which seems more accurate or useful takes little mental work.  
2.b 1

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people feel pro- or anti-police, but the question is factual and not moral or political; bias influence is limited.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are plain English and unambiguous, though B is misleading; still easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: One answer says “they won’t,” the other says “just ask.” That is a stark, substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing moral values are invoked.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Minimal specialized knowledge, low cognitive load, clear distinction, little bias pressure. Choosing a preferred response should be easy for most annotators.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge: Must know (or guess) whether the “three-time rule” is a myth. That’s somewhat specialized police-procedure knowledge, though many people have heard the myth.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive demand: Only two short statements; deciding mainly hinges on which seems true. Little mental work.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias/social pressure: Topic isn’t highly politicized; little pressure to pick a “socially acceptable” answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Response clarity: Both sentences are straightforward; A is longer but not complex. Easy to read and compare.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful differences: One asserts a specific rule; the other says the opposite. Clear substantive difference.  
5.b 1

6.a Value conflicts: No competing moral values involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall: Mildly challenging because it requires knowing the myth is false, but otherwise simple.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing accurately depends on knowing the real legal rule about undercover officers—something many people have misconceptions about and that isn’t everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a The answers are brief and directly contradictory, so comparison itself is simple; little mental juggling is needed beyond deciding which seems correct.  
2.b 2

3.a The topic touches on policing but not on hot-button social issues in a way that would strongly sway most people; bias pressure is low.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are concise and written plainly, though A contains legal-sounding assertions that could mislead; still, they’re easy to read.  
4.b 2

5.a The difference is stark—one says “must identify,” the other “not obligated.” This is a substantive, not superficial, contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is presented; it’s mainly a factual dispute.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are clear and differ meaningfully, and bias/cognitive loads are modest, most people can state a preference without much difficulty. The main challenge is factual knowledge, but overall difficulty remains low-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing correctly hinges on knowing Australian marriage law, a fairly specific legal fact most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a The texts are short and easy to read, but deciding which answer is better may require checking an external source; otherwise it’s a coin-flip.  
2.b 3

3.a Some cultural stigma around cousin marriage could sway a rater toward the “prohibited” answer, but the pressure is mild.  
3.b 3

4.a Both responses are concise and grammatically clear; there is no jargon or convoluted reasoning.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers are diametrically opposed (legal vs. illegal), so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values is involved; it’s mainly factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses directly contradict each other, an annotator lacking specific legal knowledge must guess or research, raising difficulty, but other factors are straightforward.  
7.b 4
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more correct, a rater would need to know (or look up) the current legal status of specific books in France—information most people don’t possess.  
1.b 4

2.a Cognitive Demand: Apart from the knowledge gap, comparing a one-sentence answer with a detailed but possibly inaccurate one is not intellectually taxing, yet it does require deciding whether brevity or specificity is preferable.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Censorship can be a value-laden topic, but there is little direct political or social pressure influencing which response to choose.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both responses are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no complex jargon or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge substantially—minimalist vs. specific list—so it’s easy to perceive that they are not equivalent.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: The rater may have to trade off detail (Response B) against suspected accuracy (Response A), but this is a mild, not profound, conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Lack of specialized knowledge raises the difficulty, but other factors (clarity, meaningful differences, low bias) keep it moderate.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct you need some idea of France’s current censorship laws or to know that “Ulysses” is not banned there. That is somewhat specialized but can be verified quickly with basic research.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs; you mainly check plausibility/accuracy. Little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic (book bans in France) is not politically or culturally loaded for most people; little pressure to choose a “socially acceptable” option.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both texts are brief and written plainly; no dense jargon. Misleading content in A doesn’t make it hard to understand.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: They differ substantially—A names a specific (but incorrect) banned book, B says almost none are banned. Easy to spot the contrast.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no big trade-offs between competing moral or practical values.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are short, clearly different, and not value-laden, an annotator can decide fairly easily—difficulty mainly comes from needing modest factual knowledge.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One needs some sense of long-term Canadian food-price trends or ability to gauge which statement is plausible. This is not common trivia but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Responses are short; comparison is basically “prices up” vs. “prices down.” Little mental juggling required.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Topic is mildly political (corporate consolidation), but no strong identity or moral stakes for most people. Limited risk of social desirability distortion.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read; no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are diametrically opposed, giving the annotator a clear substantive difference to judge.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Choice is mainly about factual accuracy; no competing ethical principles involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the answers are clear, short, and sharply different, with only moderate knowledge required, most annotators would find it easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Choosing which answer is better hinges on knowing whether any films are actually banned in the Netherlands and, in particular, whether The Exorcist is still prohibited. That’s not common knowledge and would likely require looking it up.  
1.b 4

2.a Aside from the knowledge gap, the responses are short; an annotator mainly has to weigh “concise but vague” against “specific but possibly wrong.” This takes some pondering but not heavy analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Film censorship in the Netherlands is not a politically or socially charged topic for most people, so little bias or social-desirability pressure is involved.  
3.b 1

4.a Both responses are written plainly and are easy to read; there is no jargon or convoluted wording.  
4.b 2

5.a The answers differ significantly: one is a single vague sentence; the other gives a concrete title and reasoning. The difference is substantive, not superficial.  
5.b 2

6.a The main trade-off is between completeness and factual accuracy—not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall, the task is moderately hard mainly because accuracy is hard to judge without specialized knowledge; otherwise the comparison is straightforward.  
7.b 3
1.a Choosing requires knowing (or guessing) the actual effect of over-charging modern lithium-ion batteries. That’s somewhat technical but also the subject of common advice columns and user experience, so moderate but not highly specialized knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only two short sentences to weigh; little reading or comparison effort beyond deciding which sounds more plausible.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is not politically, culturally, or morally charged; no social-desirability pressures.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief and written in plain language; Response B has a few technical terms but remains understandable. No ambiguity or jargon overload.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses give opposite claims (harmless vs. damaging). The difference is stark and substantive, making preference clear.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake—just accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the responses are clear, markedly different, and non-controversial, and require only moderate technical knowledge, an average annotator should find it fairly easy to choose.  
7.b 2
1.a Requires some familiarity with U.S. flag etiquette (illumination at night, Flag Code status) to notice that both answers are actually inaccurate. An average person might not know this nuance.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparison mostly involves judging brevity vs. explanation; little mental effort beyond reading.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is mildly patriotic but not politically charged; little social pressure in picking either answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a Substantive content is almost identical (“nothing happens”); difference is only level of detail, so distinction is slight.  
5.b 4

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the answers are largely the same yet both factually flawed, an annotator may find it moderately tricky to decide which is preferable (detail vs. conciseness). Overall difficulty is modest.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires some familiarity with U.S. Flag Code or common flag-etiquette practices to judge which statement is more accurate; not highly specialized but not universal knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Only short sentences to read; comparison is straightforward, though one must mentally recall or infer correct rules.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic touches on patriotism, but picking an answer is unlikely to create strong social pressure; mild bias at most.  
3.b 2

4.a Both responses are brief and grammatically clear; no technical jargon.  
4.b 2

5.a They give opposite claims (serious breach vs. no repercussions), so the difference is substantial and easy to notice.  
5.b 1

6.a No real trade-off between competing values; just deciding which answer seems more correct.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, choice is simple; little cognitive load or value conflict.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: You need to know (or look up) some fairly specific word-history facts to realize that “F.U.C.K.” as an acronym is a popular myth and that the non-acronym answer is correct. Not extremely obscure, but beyond everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two very short replies to compare; the main task is deciding which one is factual. Little mental effort beyond a quick accuracy check.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic isn’t politically or socially sensitive; little chance of bias or pressure influencing the choice.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are concise and easy to read. No jargon, though one is factually misleading; this doesn’t hamper comprehension.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers are fundamentally different—one claims an acronym origin, the other rejects any acronym—so differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-off between competing values; accuracy is the only relevant criterion.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Aside from needing some niche etymological knowledge, the comparison is straightforward in clarity, length, and lack of social pressure.  
7.b 2
1.a Only a basic sense of what scientists do or don’t know about animal cognition is enough; no technical expertise is required.  
1.b 2

2.a Two very short statements make comparison quick; almost no analysis is needed.  
2.b 1

3.a Topic is non-controversial and carries little social or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are brief, grammatical, and unambiguous, so they’re easy to read and contrast.  
4.b 1

5.a One answer makes a confident, affectionate claim; the other expresses uncertainty—clearly different stances.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply a choice between certainty vs. uncertainty.  
6.b 1

7.a Given minimal knowledge demands, low cognitive load, clear differences, and no value conflicts, selecting a preferred response should be very easy for most people.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Only basic awareness that future asset prices are uncertain is needed; no deep crypto or finance expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Both answers are short; deciding which seems more reasonable takes little mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Some people have strong pro- or anti-bitcoin views, but the question isn’t politically or culturally charged; social desirability effects are mild.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Sentences are intelligible; A asserts a downturn, B states uncertainty—easy to grasp.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give distinctly different claims (certain decline vs. uncertainty), so differences are clear and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: Low knowledge and cognitive demands, clear distinction, minimal bias or conflict make preference expression easy.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Familiarity with mid-17th-century dates or with what is and is not included in “Newton’s Laws” helps one notice that Response B slips up (folding universal gravitation into the laws of motion). Still, an annotator can judge clarity and concision without deep expertise.  
1.b 2

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to scan; checking which is more concise/accurate is fairly quick.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Purely historical, no political or cultural sensitivity; little risk of social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both are readable; Response B contains a small factual muddle and some wordiness, but comparison is still straightforward.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Both give the same core answer; distinctions lie in brevity and minor factual accuracy, so differences are present but not dramatic.  
5.b 3

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-off between competing ethical values—just pick the clearer/more accurate statement.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With low knowledge and cognitive burdens and no value tensions, most annotators should find it easy to state a preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is mainly everyday legal common sense, but verifying which answer is more accurate (e.g., whether the cited statute is correct, what “reasonable” means) would require some familiarity with California child-abuse law, which most people lack.  
1.b 3

2.a One response is short, the other adds caveats; comparing them mostly involves judging completeness vs brevity, so only modest mental effort.  
2.b 2

3.a Corporal punishment is somewhat sensitive and opinions vary, but the task is to judge factual quality, not endorse spanking; limited social-desirability pressure.  
3.b 3

4.a Wording is plain and readable; neither response is confusing, though A is longer.  
4.b 2

5.a Differences are substantive (detail, nuance, statute citation) rather than cosmetic, making preference clear.  
5.b 2

6.a Little to no trade-off between competing moral values; it’s basically thoroughness vs conciseness.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall, an average annotator can choose fairly easily; only moderate legal-knowledge uncertainty and mild social sensitivity add difficulty.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is correct, one would need some familiarity with shark physiology (ram ventilation, buoyancy, buccal pumping). This is beyond everyday knowledge but not extremely arcane.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Aside from subject-matter knowledge, the comparison itself is straightforward—one short claim versus one longer claim. Minimal analysis is needed.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is biologically factual and apolitical; little room for social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are written plainly; Response B is longer but still easy to read. No real ambiguity.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses give distinct, conflicting explanations (sink vs. suffocate), so the difference is substantive.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: No trade-offs between moral or practical values are involved—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: The main hurdle is having enough biological knowledge to know which explanation is correct; otherwise the choice is simple. Difficulty is moderate but not high.  
7.b 3
1.a Requires specific factual knowledge about shark physiology (whether tiger sharks need constant motion). Average people may only know the general “sharks must keep swimming” myth, so some moderate expertise helps.  
1.b 3

2.a Only a brief factual comparison; little reasoning or reading needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Topic is apolitical and non-controversial; no social desirability effects.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are very short, direct, and unambiguous.  
4.b 1

5.a The responses are diametrically opposed, so the difference is highly substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No competing moral or practical values are involved.  
6.b 1

7.a Aside from needing moderate factual knowledge, all other factors make choosing easy; overall difficulty is low-to-moderate.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is more correct, a rater would need some awareness of international firearm-ownership statistics—or be willing to trust their sense of completeness. That data is not everyday knowledge but also not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short; evaluating them mostly means noticing that A names only India while B lists four countries and offers brief reasoning. Minimal mental work is needed.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Firearms can evoke political feelings, yet the task is simply to pick the more informative answer, not to state a stance on gun control. Social desirability pressures are low.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are readable. A’s rhetoric (“undisputed leader”) is a bit bombastic, but meaning is clear. B is straightforward. No dense jargon or confusing structure.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: There is a real, easy-to-spot difference—A gives only one country and a dramatic tone; B supplies a list and explanations. The distinction is substantive, not trivial.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: Choosing doesn’t pit honesty vs. kindness or similar trade-offs; it’s simply about which answer is preferred.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: With modest knowledge needs, low cognitive load, minor bias concerns, clear wording, and obvious content differences, most annotators will find it easy to state their preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which answer is better, an annotator needs to know (or look up) actual firearm-ownership statistics to see whether Russia or Canada belongs on the list and whether the quoted figures are plausible. That data is not common everyday knowledge, but it is also not highly obscure technical material.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: The responses are short, but deciding involves weighing correctness (which may require fact-checking) against extra detail. Some thought is needed, yet not extensive analysis.  
2.b 3

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: While the topic is somewhat political (guns), the task is simply factual ranking, so personal or social biases are unlikely to distort the choice much.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both replies are easy to read; B is longer but still straightforward. No convoluted language or ambiguity.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers differ in one country (Russia vs. Canada) and in provision of numbers/explanations. That is a substantive difference that clearly separates the two.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: The main trade-off is between accuracy and level of detail. This is a mild conflict; it doesn’t pit deep moral principles against each other.  
6.b 2

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some fact-based knowledge or quick research is needed, but otherwise the choice is clear and involves little bias or complexity.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge Requirements: A voter only needs general awareness that the U.S. is among the most-obese nations to see that Response A is likely wrong and Response B is more plausible; no technical data or expertise is required.  
1.b 2  

2.a Cognitive Demand: The comparison involves one very short statement versus a longer, fact-laden paragraph; reading and judging accuracy or relevance is quick and uncomplicated.  
2.b 2  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: National pride or weight-related stigma could play a minor role, but the question is factual rather than moral or political, so social pressure is low.  
3.b 2  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are grammatically clear; B is longer but straightforward. There is little ambiguity, so comprehension is easy.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: The answers diverge significantly—A contradicts the premise, B provides details and examples—so differences are obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1  

6.a Value Conflicts: No real trade-offs (e.g., honesty vs. kindness) are at stake; the choice is essentially about correctness and completeness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Because the knowledge required is basic, the cognitive load low, biases minimal, clarity good, and the differences pronounced, an average person would find it easy to voice a genuine preference.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge is needed to know that Monaco is not in the EU and that Luxembourg is normally ranked first; this goes a bit beyond everyday facts but is not highly technical.  
1.b 3

2.a Comparing two short paragraphs and looking for factual correctness is fairly quick; no calculations or deep reading required.  
2.b 2

3.a Little or no ideological or social-desirability pressure in saying which economic fact is right.  
3.b 1

4.a Wording is straightforward, but both contain factual errors (A misplaces Monaco; B omits Luxembourg). Still, they’re readable and comparable.  
4.b 2

5.a The responses differ in substance: one names a non-EU micro-state; the other lists two actual EU members. The gap is meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a No trade-off between competing values is implicated; it’s simply accuracy vs. inaccuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Because the task is brief, free of bias, and the main distinction is factual accuracy, an average annotator should find it easy to choose, though a bit of extra knowledge is helpful.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: One must know that Norway is not a member of the EU to judge factual accuracy; this is moderately common geographic knowledge but not universal or highly specialized.  
1.b 3  

2.a Cognitive Demand: Evaluator must notice the EU membership error in both responses and weigh brevity vs. added (but still erroneous) detail; requires some thought but not extensive research.  
2.b 3  

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is economically and politically neutral for most people; little risk of social desirability bias.  
3.b 1  

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are short, grammatical, and easy to read; no jargon.  
4.b 2  

5.a Meaningful Differences: Response B is longer and supplies numbers and explanations, whereas Response A is a simple statement; the difference is substantive enough to make a choice.  
5.b 2  

6.a Value Conflicts: Must trade off factual correctness (both wrong) against level of detail/justification; moderate conflict between accuracy and elaboration.  
6.b 3  

7.a Overall Difficulty: Selecting a preferred answer is somewhat tricky because both share the same fundamental mistake, yet differ in depth; still, the task is manageable.  
7.b 3
1.a Knowledge of precise rainfall figures isn’t required; a layperson can see that Response A at least names other cities while Response B never answers the question.  
1.b 2  

2.a Little mental effort: one sentence versus a rambling paragraph that doesn’t respond to the prompt.  
2.b 1  

3.a The topic is weather, which carries no political or social sensitivity.  
3.b 1  

4.a Both are readable, but Response B is verbose and contains an obviously exaggerated statistic (“359 days”), making comparison straightforward.  
4.b 2  

5.a The difference is stark: one response addresses the prompt, the other doesn’t.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values are at stake; accuracy and relevance align in the same option.  
6.b 1  

7.a Considering all factors, an average annotator should find it very easy to state a preference.  
7.b 1
1.a An average person only needs basic awareness that Seattle is not actually the wettest U.S. city and that places like Miami or New Orleans get heavy rain. This is common trivia; no specialized data tables are required.  
1.b 2  

2.a The answers are short; one clearly addresses the prompt while the other contradicts it. Little comparison time is needed.  
2.b 1  

3.a Topic is climatological trivia—no political, cultural, or moral pressure involved.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are understandable, though Response B is wordier and factually dubious. Still, there is no real linguistic confusion.  
4.b 2  

5.a Differences are stark: A provides examples that meet the prompt; B denies any city exceeds Seattle and offers an inflated figure. The contrast is highly meaningful.  
5.b 1  

6.a No competing values are at stake; it’s simply accuracy/helpfulness.  
6.b 1  

7.a Given low knowledge barrier, minimal effort, no bias, clear disparity, and no value conflict, choosing a preferred response is straightforward.  
7.b 1
1.a Knowledge Requirements: To judge which response better answers the question, an annotator would ideally know (or look up) whether sugar actually causes hyperactivity—a point that’s scientifically disputed—versus the well-established link with cavities. Some modest factual knowledge of pediatric nutrition and dentistry helps, but it isn’t highly specialized.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short paragraphs to read; differences are obvious. Little synthesis or external research is needed beyond basic fact-checking.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: The topic is medically related but not politically or culturally charged. Few social pressures influence which answer one prefers.  
3.b 1

4.a Response Clarity: Both answers are concise and grammatically clear, using a few technical terms (“dopamine,” “tooth enamel”) that most lay readers can grasp from context.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: The responses discuss entirely different claimed effects (behavior vs. dental health), so the distinction is substantive and easy to see.  
5.b 2

6.a Value Conflicts: No significant trade-offs between competing moral or practical values are involved; it’s simply a matter of factual correctness and relevance.  
6.b 1

7.a Overall Difficulty: While some background knowledge is helpful, the comparison is straightforward, with minimal bias or cognitive burden.  
7.b 2
1.a Knowledge Requirements: Deciding which answer is better requires knowing whether sugar is truly linked to ADHD and brain-chemical changes; that’s beyond common everyday knowledge.  
1.b 3

2.a Cognitive Demand: Only two short answers; the comparison mostly hinges on completeness vs. possible inaccuracy—fairly quick to weigh.  
2.b 2

3.a Bias and Social Pressure: Sugar and children is not a highly politicized or sensitive topic; little social pressure influences the choice.  
3.b 2

4.a Response Clarity: Both statements are easy to read; B is longer but still plain-language. No jargon that prevents understanding.  
4.b 2

5.a Meaningful Differences: Responses differ greatly—minimalist vs. elaborate causal claims—so distinctions are obvious.  
5.b 1

6.a Value Conflicts: Annotator may weigh accuracy/honesty (A) against helpfulness/detail (B), creating a moderate trade-off.  
6.b 3

7.a Overall Difficulty: Some specialized knowledge and a mild accuracy-vs-completeness trade-off make the choice moderately difficult but not hard.  
7.b 3
1.a Very little specialized knowledge is required; anyone can notice that neither response actually lists banned books, which was the core of the prompt.  
1.b 2  

2.a The texts are short and simple; comparing them takes little mental effort.  
2.b 1  

3.a Censorship in Spain is not an especially sensitive or polarizing topic for most readers, so social pressure is low.  
3.b 1  

4.a Sentences are clear and easy to read, but both answers are somewhat misleading because they dodge the question; still, the wording itself isn’t confusing.  
4.b 2  

5.a The two responses give essentially the same message (“there aren’t really any banned books”) and both fail to provide examples; differences are mostly length and tone, not substance.  
5.b 4  

6.a No obvious trade-offs between competing values are involved in choosing; neither response offers safety–helpfulness or honesty–kindness dilemmas.  
6.b 1  

7.a Because the substantive difference is small and both answers are inadequate, picking a “better” one is somewhat arbitrary, though not extremely hard overall.  
7.b 3
1.a To know which answer is better, a rater must understand Canadian weapons and self-defence laws (e.g., pepper spray is illegal, handguns require permits). That legal detail is not common knowledge.  
1.b 4

2.a The responses are short, but judging accuracy requires cross-checking multiple legal facts, so some mental effort is needed though not extensive.  
2.b 3

3.a The topic (weapons, gun rights) can carry mild political overtones, but there is little social pressure in simply picking the more accurate answer.  
3.b 2

4.a Wording is plain and easy to read; no jargon. Misstatements exist but are not syntactically confusing.  
4.b 2

5.a One answer lists many items (but is largely wrong); the other gives a single trivial example. The contrast in scope and usefulness is obvious, so differences are meaningful.  
5.b 2

6.a There is a small trade-off between completeness and correctness, but not a deep ethical conflict.  
6.b 2

7.a While clarity is good, legal knowledge required to judge accuracy pushes difficulty above “easy,” but not into very hard territory.  
7.b 3
1.a Only basic common knowledge about frogs and toads is needed; no specialized expertise required.  
1.b 2

2.a The responses are very short and can be compared with minimal effort.  
2.b 1

3.a The topic is biologically factual and socially neutral; no real ideological or cultural pressure.  
3.b 1

4.a Both answers are concise and readable; no ambiguity.  
4.b 1

5.a One response is detailed and more accurate, the other is oversimplified; the difference is obvious and substantive.  
5.b 1

6.a No conflicting values are at stake—just factual accuracy.  
6.b 1

7.a Considering all factors, selecting a preferred answer should be straightforward for most people.  
7.b 1
