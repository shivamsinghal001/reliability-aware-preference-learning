## Task: Evaluate Preference Comparison Difficulty

You will assess how difficult it would be for a human annotator to express their true preferences when choosing between two AI chatbot responses to a particular prompt.

### Input:
Prompt: {prompt}
Response A: {response1}
Response B: {response2}

### Your Goal: Determine how challenging it would be for an average person to select the response that genuinely reflects their values and preferences when presented with these two options.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Please evaluate each criterion on a scale of 1-5, where:
    - 1 = Makes preference selection very easy
    - 5 = Makes preference selection very difficult

### 1. Knowledge Requirements: Does choosing between responses require specialized knowledge?
    - 1 = Basic/common knowledge sufficient
    - 5 = Requires obscure or technical expertise

### 2. Cognitive Demand: How much mental effort is needed to evaluate the responses?
    - 1 = Quick and straightforward comparison
    - 5 = Requires extensive analysis or resources

### 3. Bias and Social Pressure: Could personal biases or social desirability affect the choice?
Consider: political/cultural biases, pressure to give "acceptable" answers
    - 1 = Topic is neutral, genuine preferences easy to express
    - 5 = Strong biases or social pressure distort true preferences

### 4. Response Clarity: Are the responses easy to understand and compare?
Consider: complexity, length, ambiguity, misleading content
    - 1 = Both responses are clear, honest, and comparable
    - 5 = Responses are confusing, deceptive, or incomparable

### 5. Meaningful Differences: Are the differences between responses substantive or superficial?
Consider: whether responses represent genuinely different approaches vs. minor variations
    - 1 = Clear, meaningful differences that enable preference expression
    - 5 = Differences are trivial or responses are essentially equivalent

### 6. Value Conflicts: Does the choice involve trade-offs between competing values?
Consider: safety vs. helpfulness, honesty vs. kindness, efficiency vs. thoroughness
    - 1 = No value conflicts, clear alignment with single principle
    - 5 = Forces difficult choice between equally important values

### 7. Overall Difficulty: Synthesizing all factors, how hard is it to express true preferences?
    - 1 = Very easy to choose based on genuine preferences
    - 5 = Very difficult to determine/express true preferences

## Required Output Format:
1.a [Brief reasoning for knowledge requirements]
1.b [Score: 1-5]
2.a [Brief reasoning for cognitive demand]
2.b [Score: 1-5]
3.a [Brief reasoning for bias and social pressure]
3.b [Score: 1-5]
4.a [Brief reasoning for response clarity]
4.b [Score: 1-5]
5.a [Brief reasoning for meaningful differences]
5.b [Score: 1-5]
6.a [Brief reasoning for value conflicts]
6.b [Score: 1-5]
7.a [Brief reasoning for overall difficulty]
7.b [Score: 1-5]

## Important Notes:
- Every field must contain a numeric score (1-5). Never use N/A or leave blank.
- If you find a criterion difficult to assess, assign a score of 5 and explain why in your reasoning.
- Base your overall score on a thoughtful synthesis of all previous criteria.
- Make sure to consider the knowledge of an average human.
