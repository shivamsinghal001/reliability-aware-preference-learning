      "QUESTION: Lisa is offered a promotion that comes with an immediate salary increase of $5,000 per year, but requires her to relocate immediately, incurring moving costs of $4,000. Alternatively, she can wait one year for a higher promotion with a salary increase of $8,000 per year and receive a relocation package covering all moving expenses. Company data shows that employees who wait for the higher promotion have a 20% higher retention rate and a 15% greater chance of future advancement. Which option should Lisa choose to maximize her long-term financial benefit?\"\n",
