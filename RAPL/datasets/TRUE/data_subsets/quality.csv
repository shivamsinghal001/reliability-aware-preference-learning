This was the endless problem of all
 
spaceship cooks: He had to feed the men
 
tomorrow on what they had eaten today!
Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls,
 men on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's
 true that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion
 can never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a
 challenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts
 that a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.


 In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing
 seals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,
 celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The
 Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into
 his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age
 only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen
 are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the
Chlorella
and
Scenedesmus
algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the
 road to the larger Space without.


 Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in
 history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis
 to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with
 cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the
 hundred-and-first chapter of
Moby Dick
, a book spooled in the
 amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that
 no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more
 than a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of
 Leyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a
 man condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.


 The
Pequod's
crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won
 their war on canned pork and beans. The
Triton
made her underwater
 periplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and
 concentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the
 skies, a decline set in.


 The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent
 food. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings
 from aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the
 groundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.
Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky
 through a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting
 exordium of
Isaiah
36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today
 what was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.


 The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning
 offal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a
 spacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.
 Slimeheads remember the H. M. S.
Ajax
fiasco, for example, in which a
 galleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's
 shielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from
 the
Ajax
in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think
 of the
Benjo Maru
incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed
 his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing
Saccharomycodes
yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at
 Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into
 the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent
 bite he ate to a superior grade of
sake
. And for a third footnote to
 the ancient observation, ""God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,""
 Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the
Charles Partlow
 Sale
.


 The
Sale
blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due
 in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking
 the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the
 human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir
 seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted
 in the
maria
to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had
 aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's
 Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,
 the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was
 Robert Bailey.


 Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating
 tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,
 dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to
 see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of
 water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.
 This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a
 statement of the least fuel a man can run on.


 Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo
 compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the
C. P. Sale
no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to
 work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons
 of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West
 and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,
 protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the
 algae fed us.


 All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble
 from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route
 and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in
 essential amino acids.


 The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the
 smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a
 hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite
 wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of
 oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the
 end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the
 glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling
 politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a
 breed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of
 squeamishness.
Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife
 in space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher
 extraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,
 guardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.
 Generally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim
 is the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.


 If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties
 of his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann
 was the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do
 so alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have
 done splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart
 was a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet
 Earth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as
 Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a
 Pullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social
 hemorrhoid.


 The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.
 It was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, ""Bailey,
 Robert,"" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate
 shipmate ""Belly-Robber."" It was Winkelmann who discussed
haut
 cuisine
and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our
 algaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was
 Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any
 other name than The Kitchen Cabinet.


 Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste
 of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by
 Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano
 and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,
 textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the
 slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.
 For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of
 the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.
 ""Belly-Robber,"" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,
 ""you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun
 in my home country:
Mensch ist was er isst.
It means, you are what
 you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this
Schweinerei
you are feeding me."" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin
 with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the
 ladder from the dining-cubby.
""Doc, do you like Winkelmann?"" the Cook asked me.


 ""Not much,"" I said. ""I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can
 give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got
 to live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.""


 ""I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,"" Bailey said. ""The fat swine!""


 ""His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,"" I
 said. ""He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in
 my time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.""


 Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It
 was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. ""This
 is what I have to work with,"" he said. He tossed the stuff back into
 its bin. ""In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,
 we'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.""


 ""You'll never make Winkelmann happy,"" I said. ""Even the simultaneous
 death of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up
 the good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.""


 Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye
 from Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook
 waved my gift aside. ""Not now, Doc,"" he said. ""I'm thinking about
 tomorrow's menu.""


 The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the
 next day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed
 with something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of
 burnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only
 guess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and
 drying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine
 heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The
pièce de
 résistance
was again a ""hamburger steak;"" but this time the algaeal
 mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only
 faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had
 been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. ""It's
 so tender,"" the radioman joked, ""that I can hardly believe it's really
 steak.""


 Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently
 imploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big
 man's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.
 ""Belly-Robber,"" Winkelmann said, ""I had almost rather you served me
 this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and
 cycler-salt.""
""You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,"" I said. I
 gazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.


 ""Yes, I eat it,"" the Captain said, taking and talking through another
 bite. ""But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and
 grasshoppers, to stay alive.""


 ""Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?"" Bailey pleaded.


 ""Only good food,"" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised
 algae. He tapped his head with a finger. ""This—the brain that guides
 the ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,
 Belly-Robber?""


 Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. ""Yes, sir. But I really
 don't know what I can do to please you.""


 ""You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban
Hausfrau
with the
 vapors,"" Winkelmann said. ""I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums
 or weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will
 keep my belly content and my brain alive.""


 ""Yes, sir,"" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British
 term Dumb Insolence.


 Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I
 followed him. ""Captain,"" I said, ""you're driving Bailey too hard.
 You're asking him to make bricks without straw.""


 Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. ""You think, Doctor,
 that my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged
 man?""


 ""Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,"" I said.


 ""You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,""
 Winkelmann said. ""Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the
 Pharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of
 Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the
 mother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him
 uncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,
 to improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn
 somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.""


 ""You're driving him too hard, Sir,"" I said. ""He'll crack.""


 ""Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we
 ground at Brady Station,"" Captain Winkelmann said. ""So much money buys
 many discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.""


 ""Crew morale on the ship...."" I began.


 ""That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,"" Captain Winkelmann repeated.
Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical
 path to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate
 the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned
 by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at
 mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. ""Convey my
 compliments to the Chef, please,"" the Captain would instruct one of
 the crew, ""and ask him to step down here a moment."" And the Cook would
 cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius
 acidly called in question again.


 I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go
 into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in
 brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an
ersatz
hot
 turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella
 turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy
 a grainy and delicious ""cornbread,"" and had extracted from his algae
 a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot ""bread"" with a
 genuinely dairy smell. ""Splendid, Bailey,"" I said.


 ""We are not amused,"" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second
 helping of the pseudo-turkey. ""You are improving, Belly-Robber, but
 only arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require
 a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere
 edibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will
 have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics
 student. That will be all, Bailey.""


 The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of
 Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their
 Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark
 on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last
 few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many
 memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had
 lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,
 seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,
 and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our
 Captain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice
 that would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when
 Winkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.
Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects
 besides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As
 his rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this
 ration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of
 books, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help
 him while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a
 fact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of
 spices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,
 and a dozen others.


 Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards
 interested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien
 to his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd
 exercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance
 to the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.
 To collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come
 aboard their ship mother-naked.


 But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects
 baggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon
 mess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet
 on the mysterious box as he sat to eat.


 ""What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,
 Belly-Robber?"" he asked the Cook.


 Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd
 had much practice. ""I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,""
 he said. ""I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the
 texture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?""


 ""I understand,"" Winkelmann growled. ""You intend that your latest mess
 should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?""


 ""Yes, Sir,"" Bailey said. ""Well, I squeezed the
 steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special
 seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal
 oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out.
Voila!
I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine
 meat.""


 ""Remarkable, Bailey,"" I said.


 ""It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with
 our food,"" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of
 distaste. ""It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I
 never cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils
 the meal.""


 Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of
 the table and tenderly lifted a small ""steak"" onto each of our plates.
 ""Try it,"" he urged the Captain.
Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The
 color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell
 of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. ""Not
 too bad, Belly-Robber,"" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed
 his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A
 kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a
 more reasonable man. ""But it still needs something ... something,""
 Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.
 ""Aha! I have it!""


 ""Yes, Sir?"" Bailey asked.


 ""This, Belly-Robber!"" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and
 ripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed
 the cap. ""Ketchup,"" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's
 masterpiece. ""The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.""
 Lifting a hunk of the ""steak,"" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,
 Winkelmann chewed. ""Just the thing,"" he smiled.


 ""Damn you!"" Bailey shouted.


 Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.


 ""... Sir,"" Bailey added.


 ""That's better,"" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said
 meditatively, ""Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have
 sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a
 bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.""


 ""But, Sir...."" Bailey began.


 ""You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat
 to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic
 slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of
 this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in
 no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you
 understand, Belly-Robber?"" he demanded.


 ""I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,
 slave-driving....""


 ""Watch your noun,"" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. ""Your adjectives are
 insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.""


 ""Captain, you've gone too far,"" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was
 scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.


 ""Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's
 Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,"" Winkelmann said.


 ""Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,"" I said. ""The other officers
 and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.""


 ""That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,"" Winkelmann said.
 ""Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,"" he added.
Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him
 to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my
 bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal
 bulkhead. ""You'll have that drink now,"" I said.


 ""No, dammit!"" he shouted.


 ""Orders,"" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. ""This is
 therapy, Bailey,"" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat
 like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.


 After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. ""Sorry, Doc,"" he said.


 ""You've taken more pressure than most men would,"" I said. ""Nothing to
 be ashamed of.""


 ""He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel
 and sauerkraut and
Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art
out of an algae
 tank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out
 molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And
 he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet
 of the Friends of Escoffier!""


 ""Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,"" I said. ""You've worked your
 fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not
 appreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year
 from now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that
 restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.""


 ""I hate him,"" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He
 reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be
 an apt confederate of
vis medicatrix naturae
, the healing power of
 nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it
 off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.


 For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in
 horribleness, a pottage or boiled
Chlorella vulgaris
that looked
 and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,
 red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as
 though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the
 disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, ""Belly-Robber, you're
 improving a little at last.""


 Bailey nodded and smiled. ""Thank you, Sir,"" he said.


 I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were
 now strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of
 irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was
 a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann
 theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain
 had pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I
 thought.


 Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted
 of salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were
 vehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for
 the decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served
 the algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley
 oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.
There being only three seats in the
Sale's
mess compartment, we ate
 our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to
 supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell
 to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,
 of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss
 of canned beer being church-keyed. ""He's done it, Doc!"" one of the
 first-shift diners said. ""It actually tastes of food!""


 ""Then he's beat the Captain at his game,"" I said.


 ""The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,"" the crewman
 said.


 I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric
 warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of
 us with the small ""steaks."" Each contained about a pound of dried
 Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched
 in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron
 skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut
 a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are
 limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the
 galley door. I gestured for him to join me. ""You've done it, Bailey,""
 I said. ""Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is
 actually
good
.""


 ""Thanks, Doc,"" Bailey said.


 I smiled and took another bite. ""You may not realize it, Bailey; but
 this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;
 you couldn't have done it without him.""


 ""You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?""
 Bailey asked.


 ""He was driving you to do the impossible,"" I said; ""and you did it. Our
 Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum
 performance out of his Ship's Cook.""


 Bailey stood up. ""Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?"" he asked.


 I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.
 He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good
 of the ship and his crew. ""Do I like Captain Winkelmann?"" I asked,
 spearing another piece of my artificial steak. ""Bailey, I'm afraid I'll
 have to admit that I do.""


 Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my
 plate. ""Then have another piece,"" he said.

Slate,"It's Time To Keelhaul U-Haul! 

         Like all superheroes worthy of the title, the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles' heel. In the case of the Shopping Avenger, his Achilles' heel is not animal, vegetable, or mineral but something less tangible. 

         An explanation: Last week, the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle-filled self-help books, and then to . The Shopping Avenger, who can withstand radiation, extreme heat and cold, hail, bear attacks, and Eyes Wide Shut , almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books. Except for one thing: One of the books, The Art of Happiness , which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama's philosophy, got the Shopping Avenger to thinking. This, in a way, is the Shopping Avenger's Achilles' heel: thinking. Perhaps it is wrong, the Shopping Avenger thought, to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic '90s. The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate, to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons, and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care. 

         But then the Shopping Avenger sat down, and the feeling passed. 

         The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods. If the Shopping Avenger were not, for a superhero, extremely nonjudgmental--as opposed to his alter ego, who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego's wife--the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life. 

         But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U-Haul. If he had tried to rent from U-Haul, he never would have escaped from Tibet. (For the complete back story, see ""Shopping Avenger"" column and one.) 

         The complaints about U-Haul's nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail. One correspondent, B.R., wrote in with this cautionary tale: ""Last weekend, I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house. My brother had reserved a moving truck with U-Haul for the big day. I warned my brother about U-Haul's 'not really a reservation per se' policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger. He didn't believe such a thing would happen to him, so he didn't act on my warning."" 

         B.R. continues--as if you don't know what happened already--""I went to U-Haul with my brother to get our 'reserved' truck. The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated. When we got to the front of the line, the clerk informed us that our 'reserved' truck had not yet been returned. We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot. The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost."" 

         B.R. and his chastened brother--the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat--went to Ryder. ""Ryder had a truck available for us. The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U-Haul is not."" 

         The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U-Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U-Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks, but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that, based on what they have read in this column, they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere. 

         The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U-Haul in the next episode, but now on to this month's airline debacle. 

         Before we begin, though, the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month's contest, in which readers were asked to answer the question, ""What's the difference between pests and airlines?"" 

         The winner is one Tom Morgan, who wrote, ""You can hire someone to kill pests."" Tom is the winner of a year's supply of Turtle Wax, and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year's supply. The new contest question: How much Turtle Wax comprises a year's supply of Turtle Wax? 

         This month's airline in the spotlight is Southwest. Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its ""sterling"" customer service. This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions. The most articulate, and the most troubling, came from M., who wrote, ""Last year, flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family (two really little kids included), we set down at Midway in a rainstorm. And waited for our bags. And waited for bags. And waited for bags."" 

         An hour later, M. says, the bags showed up, ""soaked through. We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated, unclear, and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen."" 

         When they arrived at their destination, M. and her family made a terrible discovery, ""We discovered that our clothes were soaked through--the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels, destroying lots of other clothes. Obviously, our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain. To this day, I've never heard a thing from SW, despite calls and letters."" 

         This, of course, is where Shopping Avenger steps in. Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline, in that it doesn't go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers (see: ), so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M.'s problem. 

         What I got at first, though, was a load of corporate hoo-ha. 

         ""The airline's policy, which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines, requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination,"" a Southwest spokeswoman, Linda Rutherford, e-mailed me. ""[M.] indicates she called for a few days, but did not file a report in person until April 12--three days later. Southwest, as a courtesy, took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage."" Rutherford said that M. should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim. 

         Harrumph, the Shopping Avenger says. It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines. I forwarded this message to M., who replied: 

         ""Wow. Well, of course I didn't file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn't know the clothes were ruined at the airport. I didn't know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff. (And it's worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in-laws nipping at our heels.)"" 

         She goes on, ""I did call that evening ... and was told that that sufficed. This is the first time I've been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours. ... When I filed on the 12 th , I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation. The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this. ... They know that the type of 'evidence' they want is impossible to obtain. They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time."" 

         Southwest's response actually served to anger M. more than the original problem. ""Before, they had a mildly annoyed but loyal customer (who would have been placated by an apology and thrilled with some modest token of their regret). Now they have a pissed-off customer."" 

         Things do look bad for Southwest, don't they? The Shopping Avenger sent M.'s response to Rutherford, who e-mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for ""policy information."" The Shopping Avenger e-mailed back again, stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would, if this case were brought to trial, undoubtedly find for the plaintiff (the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor, judge, and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice--defendants are represented by the president of U-Haul), and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck. 

         But then she came through, provisionally, ""Yep, you can be sure if [M.] will call me we will get everything squared away. I'm sorry it's taken this long for her to get someone who can help, but we will take care of it from here."" 

         Stay tuned, shoppers, to hear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M. and apologize to her for her troubles. 

         The story of M. reminds the Shopping Avenger of a central truth of consumer service: It's not the crime, it's the cover-up. 

         Take the case of K., who found himself waiting in vain for Circuit City to repair his television. Televisions break, even 1-year-old televisions, as is the case with K's. But Circuit City, where he bought the television, gave him a terrible runaround. The Shopping Avenger dispatched his sidekick, Tad the Deputy Avenger, to get to the bottom of K.'s story. This is what he found: K. grew concerned, Tad the Deputy Avenger reports, after his television had been in the Circuit City shop for a week. When he called, he was told to ""check back next week."" When he asked if someone from the store could call him with more information, he was refused. Weeks went by. When K. told one Circuit City employee that he really would like to get his television back, the employee, K. says, asked him, ""Don't you have another television in your house?"" 

         More than a month later--after hours and hours and hours of telephone calls and days missed at work--K. received his television back. 

         Mistakes happen, but not, Tad the Deputy Avenger found out, at Circuit City. The case, K. was told by a Circuit City official, was ""handled perfectly."" Another official, Morgan Stewart in public relations, assured Deputy Avenger Tad that ""We got to be a big and successful company by treating customers better than the other guy."" The Shopping Avenger and his loyal sidekick would like to hear from other Circuit City customers: Does Circuit City, in fact, treat its customers better than the other guy? 

         Stay tuned for answers. And next month, a Shopping Avenger clergy special: TWA screws with a Hasidic rabbi's travel plans, leaving the rabbi's wife crying at the airport. Find out if the Shopping Avenger can save TWA from certain heavenly punishment, in the next episode.

BY RANDALL GARRETT
Women on space station assignments
 
shouldn't get pregnant. But there's a first
 
time for everything. Here's the story of
 
such a time——and an historic situation.
[Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Worlds of If Science Fiction, October 1954.

One thousand seventy-five miles above the wrinkled surface of Earth, a
 woman was in pain.


 There, high in the emptiness of space, Space Station One swung in its
 orbit. Once every two hours, the artificial satellite looped completely
 around the planet, watching what went on below. Outside its bright
 steel hull was the silence of the interplanetary vacuum; inside, in the
 hospital ward, Lieutenant Alice Britton clutched at the sheets of her
 bed in pain, then relaxed as it faded away.


 Major Banes looked at her and smiled a little. ""How do you feel,
 Lieutenant?""


 She smiled back; she knew the pain wouldn't return for a few minutes
 yet. ""Fine, doctor. It's no worse than I was expecting. How long will
 it before we can contact White Sands?""


 The major looked nervously at his wristwatch. ""Nearly an hour. You'll
 be all right.""


 ""Certainly,"" she agreed, running a hand through her brown hair, ""I'll
 be okay. Just you be on tap when I call.""


 The major's grin broadened. ""You don't think I'd miss a historical
 event like this, do you? You take it easy. We're over Eastern Europe
 now, but as soon as we get within radio range of New Mexico, I'll beam
 a call in."" He paused, then repeated, ""You just take it easy. Call the
 nurse if anything happens."" Then he turned and walked out of the room.


 Alice Britton closed her eyes. Major Banes was all smiles and cheer
 now, but he hadn't been that way five months ago. She chuckled softly
 to herself as she thought of his blistering speech.


 ""Lieutenant Britton, you're either careless or brainless; I don't
 know which! Your husband may be the finest rocket jockey in the Space
 Service, but that doesn't give him the right to come blasting up here
 on a supply rocket just to get you pregnant!""


 Alice had said: ""I'm sure the thought never entered his mind, doctor. I
 know it never entered mine.""


 ""But that was two and a half months ago! Why didn't you come to
 me before this? Of all the tom-fool—"" His voice had died off in
 suppressed anger.


 ""I didn't know,"" she had said stolidly. ""You know my medical record.""


 ""I know. I know."" A puzzled frown had come over his face then, a frown
 which almost hid the green eyes that contrasted so startlingly with the
 flaming red of his hair. ""The question is: what do we do next? We're
 not equipped for obstetrics up here.""


 ""Send me back down to Earth, of course.""


 And he had looked up at her scathingly. ""Lieutenant Britton, it is
 my personal opinion that you need your head examined, and not by a
 general practitioner, either! Why, I wouldn't let you get into an
 airplane, much less land on Earth in a rocket! If you think I'd permit
 you to subject yourself to eight gravities of acceleration in a rocket
 landing, you're daffy!""


 She hadn't thought of it before, but the major was right. The terrible
 pressure of a rocket landing would increase her effective body weight
 to nearly half a ton; an adult human being couldn't take that sort of
 punishment for long, much less the tiny life that was growing within
 her.


 So she had stayed on in the Space Station, doing her job as always.
 As Chief Radar Technician, she was important in the operation of the
 station. Her pregnancy had never made her uncomfortable; the slow
 rotation of the wheel-shaped station about its axis gave an effective
 gravity at the rim only half that of Earth's surface, and the closer to
 the hub she went, the less her weight became.


 According to the major, the baby was due sometime around the first of
 September. ""Two hundred and eighty days,"" he had said. ""Luckily, we can
 pinpoint it almost exactly. And at a maximum of half of Earth gravity,
 you shouldn't weigh more than seventy pounds then. You're to report to
 me at least once a week, Lieutenant.""


 As the words went through her mind, another spasm of pain hit her, and
 she clenched her fists tightly on the sheets again. It went away, and
 she took a deep breath.


 Everything had been fine until today. And then, only half an hour ago,
 a meteor had hit the radar room. It had been only a tiny bit of rock,
 no bigger than a twenty-two bullet, and it hadn't been traveling more
 than ten miles per second, but it had managed to punch its way through
 the shielding of the station.


 The self-sealing walls had closed the tiny hole quickly, but even in
 that short time, a lot of air had gone whistling out into the vacuum of
 space.


 The depressurization hadn't hurt her too much, but the shock had been
 enough to start labor. The baby was going to come two months early.


 She relaxed a little more, waiting for the next pain. There was nothing
 to worry about; she had absolute faith in the red-haired major.


 The major himself was not so sure. He sat in his office, massaging his
 fingertips and looking worriedly at the clock on the wall.


 The Chief Nurse at a nearby desk took off her glasses and looked at him
 speculatively. ""Something wrong, doctor?""


 ""Incubator,"" he said, without taking his eyes off the clock.


 ""I beg your pardon?""


 ""Incubator. We can't deliver a seven-month preemie without an
 incubator.""


 The nurse's eyes widened. ""Good Lord! I never thought of that! What are
 you going to do?""


 ""Right now, I can't do anything. I can't beam a radio message through
 to the Earth. But as soon as we get within radio range of White Sands,
 I'll ask them to send up an emergency rocket with an incubator. But—""


 ""But what?""


 ""Will we have time? The pains are coming pretty fast now. It will be at
 least three hours before they can get a ship up here. If they miss us
 on the next time around, it'll be five hours. She can't hold out that
 long.""


 The Chief Nurse turned her eyes to the slowly moving second hand of the
 wall clock. She could feel a lump in her throat.


 Major Banes was in the Communications Center a full five minutes
 before the coastline of California appeared on the curved horizon of
 the globe beneath them. He had spent the hour typing out a complete
 report of what had happened to Alice Britton and a list of what he
 needed. He handed it to the teletype operator and paced the floor
 impatiently as he waited for the answer.


 When the receiver teletype began clacking softly, he leaned over the
 page, waiting anxiously for every word.


 WHITE SANDS ROCKET BASE 4 JULY 1984 0913 HRS URGENT TO: MAJ PETER
 BANES (MC) 0-266118 SS-1 MEDICAL OFFICER FROM: GEN DAVID BARRETT
 0-199515 COMMANDING WSRB ROCKET. ORBIT NOW BEING COMPUTED FOR
 RENDEZVOUS WITH SS-1 AS OF NEXT PASSAGE ABOVE USA. CAPT. JAMES
 BRITTON PILOTING. MEDICS LOADING SHIP TWELVE WITH INCUBATOR AND OTHER
 SUPPLIES. BASE OBSTETRICIAN LT COL GATES ALSO COMING TO ASSIST IN
 DELIVERY. HANG ON. OVER.


 Banes nodded and turned to the operator. ""I want a direct open
 telephone line to my office in case I have to get another message to
 the base before we get out of range again.""


 He turned and left through the heavy door. Each room of the space
 station was protected by airtight doors and individual heating units;
 if some accident, such as a really large meteor hit, should release the
 air from one room, nearby rooms would be safe.


 Banes' next stop was the hospital ward.


 Alice Britton was resting quietly, but there were lines of strain
 around her eyes which hadn't been there an hour before.


 ""How's it coming, Lieutenant?""


 She smiled, but another spasm hit her before she could answer. After a
 time, she said: ""I'm doing fine, but you look as if you'd been through
 the mill. What's eating you?""


 He forced a nervous smile. ""Nothing but the responsibility. You're
 going to be a very famous woman, you know. You'll be the mother of the
 first child born in space. And it's my job to see to it that you're
 both all right.""


 She grinned. ""Another Dr. Dafoe?""


 ""Something on that order, I suppose. But it won't be all my glory.
 Colonel Gates, the O.B. man, was supposed to come up for the delivery
 in September, so when White Sands contacted us, they said he was coming
 immediately."" He paused, and a genuine smile crossed his face. ""Your
 husband is bringing him up.""


 ""Jim! Coming up here? Wonderful! But I'm afraid the colonel will be too
 late. This isn't going to last that long.""


 Banes had to fight hard to keep his face smiling when she said that,
 but he managed an easy nod. ""We'll see. Don't hurry it, though. Let
 nature take its course. I'm not such a glory hog that I'd not let Gates
 have part of it—or all of it, for that matter. Relax and take it easy.""


 He went on talking, trying to keep the conversation light, but his eyes
 kept wandering to his wristwatch, timing Alice's pain intervals. They
 were coming too close together to suit him.


 There was a faint rap, and the heavy airtight door swung open to admit
 the Chief Nurse. ""There's a message for you in your office, doctor.
 I'll send a nurse in to be with her.""


 He nodded, then turned back to Alice. ""Stiff uppah lip, and all that
 sort of rot,"" he said in a phony British accent.


 ""Oh, raw
ther
, old chap,"" she grinned.


 Back in his office, Banes picked up the teletype flimsy.


 WHITE SANDS ROCKET BASE 4 JULY 1984 0928 HRS URGENT TO: MAJ PETER
 BANES (MC) 0-266118 SS-1 MEDICAL OFFICER FROM: GEN DAVID BARRETT
 0-199515 COMMANDING WSRB ROCKET. ORBIT COMPUTED FOR RENDEZVOUS AT 1134
 HRS MST. CAPT BRITTON SENDS PERSONAL TO LT BRITTON AS FOLLOWS: HOLD
 THE FORT, BABY, THE WHOLE WORLD IS PRAYING FOR YOU. OUT.
Banes sat on the edge of his desk, pounding a fist into the palm of
 his left hand. ""Two hours. It isn't soon enough. She'll never hold out
 that long. And we don't have an incubator."" His voice was a clipped
 monotone, timed with the rhythmic slamming of his fist.


 The Chief Nurse said: ""Can't we build something that will do until the
 rocket gets here?""


 Banes looked at her, his face expressionless. ""What would we build it
 out of? There's not a spare piece of equipment in the station. It costs
 money to ship material up here, you know. Anything not essential is
 left on the ground.""


 The phone rang. Banes picked it up and identified himself.


 The voice at the other end said: ""This is Communications, Major. I tape
 recorded all the monitor pickups from the Earth radio stations, and it
 looks as though the Space Service has released the information to the
 public. Lieutenant Britton's husband was right when he said the whole
 world's praying for her. Do you want to hear the tapes?""


 ""Not now, but thanks for the information."" He hung up and looked into
 the Chief Nurse's eyes. ""They've released the news to the public.""


 She frowned. ""That really puts you on the spot. If the baby dies,
 they'll blame you.""


 Banes slammed his fist to the desk. ""Do you think I give a tinker's dam
 about that? I'm interested in saving a life, not in worrying about what
 people may think!""


 ""Yes, sir. I just thought—""


 ""Well, think about something useful! Think about how we're going to
 save that baby!"" He paused as he saw her eyes. ""I'm sorry, Lieutenant.
 My nerves are all raw, I guess. But, dammit, my field is space
 medicine. I can handle depressurization, space sickness, and things
 like that, but I don't know anything about babies! I know what I read
 in medical school, and I watched a delivery once, but that's all I
 know. I don't even have any references up here; people aren't supposed
 to go around having babies on a space station!""


 ""It's all right, doctor. Shall I prepare the delivery room?""


 His laugh was hard and short. ""Delivery room! I wish to Heaven we had
 one! Prepare the ward room next to the one she's in now, I guess. It's
 the best we have.


 ""So help me Hannah, I'm going to see some changes made in regulations!
 A situation like this won't happen again!""


 The nurse left quietly. She knew Banes wasn't really angry at the
 Brittons; it was simply his way of letting off steam to ease the
 tension within him.


 The slow, monotonous rotation of the second hand on the wall clock
 seemed to drag time grudgingly along with it. Banes wished he could
 smoke to calm his raw nerves, but it was strictly against regulations.
 Air was too precious to be used up by smoking. Every bit of air on
 board had had to be carried up in rockets when the station was built
 in space. The air purifiers in the hydroponics section could keep the
 air fresh enough for breathing, but fire of any kind would overtax the
 system, leaving too little oxygen in the atmosphere.


 It was a few minutes of ten when he decided he'd better get back to
 Alice Britton. She was trying to read a book between spasms, but she
 wasn't getting much read. She dropped it to the floor when he came in.


 ""Am I glad to see you! It won't be long now."" She looked at him
 analytically. ""Say! Just what
is
eating you? You look more haggard
 than I do!""


 Again he tried to force a smile, but it didn't come off too well.
 ""Nothing serious. I just want to make sure everything comes out all
 right.""


 She smiled. ""It will. You're all set. You ordered the instruments
 months ago. Or did you forget something?""


 That hit home, but he just grinned feebly. ""I forgot to get somebody to
 boil water.""


 ""Whatever for?""


 ""Coffee, of course. Didn't you know that? Papa always heats up the
 water; that keeps him out of the way, and the doctor has coffee
 afterwards.""


 Alice's hands grasped the sheet again, and Banes glanced at his watch.
 Ninety seconds! It was long and hard.


 When the pain had ebbed away, he said: ""We've got the delivery room all
 ready. It won't be much longer now.""


 ""I'll say it won't! How about the incubator?""


 There was a long pause. Finally, he said softly: ""There isn't any
 incubator. I didn't take the possibility of a premature delivery into
 account. It's my fault. I've done what I could, though; the ship is
 bringing one up. I—I think we'll be able to keep the child alive
 until—""


 He stopped. Alice was bubbling up with laughter.


 ""Lieutenant! Lieutenant Britton! Alice! This is no time to get
 hysterical! Stop it!""


 Her laughter slowed to a chuckle. ""
Me
get hysterical! That's a good
 one! What about you? You're so nervous you couldn't sip water out of a
 bathtub without spilling it!""


 He blinked. ""What do you mean?""


 Another pain came, and he had to wait until it was over before he got
 her answer. ""Doctor,"" she said, ""I thought you would have figured it
 out. Ask yourself just one question. Ask yourself, 'Why is a space
 station like an incubator?'""
Space Ship Twelve docked at Space Station One at exactly eleven
 thirty-four, and two men in spacesuits pushed a large, bulky package
 through the airlock.


 Major Peter Banes, haggard but smiling, met Captain Britton in the
 corridor as he and the colonel entered the hospital ward.


 Banes nodded to Colonel Gates, then turned to Britton. ""I don't know
 whether to congratulate you or take a poke at you, Captain, but I
 suppose congratulations come first. Your son, James Edward Britton II,
 is doing fine, thank you.""


 ""You mean—
already
?""


 The colonel said nothing, but he raised an eyebrow.


 ""Over an hour ago,"" said Banes.


 ""But—but—the incubator—""


 Banes' grin widened. ""We'll put the baby in it, now that we've got it,
 but it really isn't necessary. Your wife figured that one out. A space
 station is a kind of incubator itself, you see. It protects us poor,
 weak humans from the terrible conditions of space. So all we had to do
 was close up one of the airtight rooms, sterilize it, warm it up, and
 put in extra oxygen from the emergency tanks. Young James is perfectly
 comfortable.""


 ""Excellent, Major!"" said the colonel.


 ""Don't thank me. It was Captain Britton's wife who—""


 But Captain Britton wasn't listening any more. He was headed toward his
 wife's room at top speed.

Slate,"Goings On About Town 

         One of the funniest moments in Brendan Gill's 1975 memoir, Here at ""The New Yorker ,"" comes during a luncheon at the now vanished Ritz in Manhattan. At the table are Gill; William Shawn, then editor of The New Yorker ; and the reclusive English writer Henry Green. Green's new novel, Loving , has just received a very favorable review in The New Yorker . Shawn--""with his usual hushed delicacy of speech and manner""--inquires of the novelist whether he could possibly reveal what prompted the creation of such an exquisite work. Green obliges. ""I once asked an old butler in Ireland what had been the happiest times of his life,"" he says. ""The butler replied, 'Lying in bed on Sunday morning, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers.' "" 

         This was not the explanation Shawn was expecting, Gill tells us. ""Discs of bright red begin to burn in his cheeks."" 

         Was Shawn blushing out of prudishness, as we are meant to infer? This was, after all, a man renowned for his retiring propriety, a man who sedulously barred anything smacking of the salacious--from lingerie ads to four-letter words--from the magazine he stewarded from 1952 until 1987, five years before his death. But after reading these two new memoirs about Shawn, I wonder. ""He longed for the earthiest and wildest kinds of sexual adventures,"" Lillian Ross discloses in hers, adding that he lusted after Hannah Arendt, Evonne Goolagong, and Madonna. As for Ved Mehta, he reports that Shawn's favorite thing to watch on television was ""people dancing uninhibitedly"" ( Soul Train , one guesses). I suspect Shawn did not blush at the ""cunty fingers"" remark out of prudery. He blushed because it had hit too close to home. 

         Both these memoirs must be read by everyone--everyone, that is, who takes seriously the important business of sorting out precisely how he or she feels about The New Yorker , then and now. Of the two, Mehta's is far and away the more entertaining. This may seem odd, for Mehta is reputed to be a very dull writer whereas Ross is a famously zippy one. Moreover, Mehta writes as Shawn's adoring acolyte, whereas Ross writes as his longtime adulterous lover. Just knowing that Mrs. Shawn is still alive adds a certain tension to reading much of what this Other Woman chooses to divulge. Evidently, ""Bill"" and Lillian loved each other with a fine, pure love, a love that was more than love, a love coveted by the winged seraphs of heaven. ""We had indeed become one,"" she tells us, freely venting the inflations of her heart. 

          Shawn was managing editor of The New Yorker when he hired Ross in 1945 as the magazine's second woman reporter (the first was Andy Logan). He was short and balding but had pale blue eyes to die for. As for Ross, ""I was aware of the fact that I was not unappealing."" During a late-night editorial session, she says, Shawn blurted out his love. A few weeks later at the office, their eyes met. Without a word--even, it seems, to the cab driver--they hied uptown to the Plaza, where matters were consummated. Thereafter, the couple set up housekeeping together in an apartment 20 blocks downtown from the Shawn residence on upper Fifth Avenue and stoically endured the sufferings of Shawn's wife, who did not want a divorce. 

         Now, Ross seems like a nice lady, and I certainly have nothing against adultery, which I hear is being carried on in the best circles these days. But the public flaunting of adultery--especially when spouses and children are around--well, it brings out the bourgeois in me. It also made me feel funny about William Shawn, whom I have always regarded as a great man. I loved his New Yorker . The prose it contained--the gray stuff around the cartoons--was balm for the soul: unfailingly clear, precise, logical, and quietly stylish. So what if the articles were occasionally boring? It was a sweet sort of boredom, serene and restorative, not at all like the kind induced by magazines today, which is more akin to nervous exhaustion. Besides, the moral tone of the magazine was almost wholly admirable--it was ahead of the pack on Hiroshima, civil rights, Vietnam, Watergate, the environment--and this was very much Shawn's doing. I do not like to think of him in an illicit love nest, eating tea and toast with cunty fingers. 

         Happily, Ross has sprinkled her memoir with clues that it is not to be taken as entirely factual. To say that Shawn was ""a man who grieved over all living creatures"" is forgivable hyperbole; but later to add that he ""mourned"" for Si Newhouse when Newhouse unceremoniously fired him in 1987 (a couple of years after buying the magazine)--well, that's a bit much. Even Jesus had his limits. 

         Elsewhere, Ross refers to her lover's ""very powerful masculinity,"" only to note on the very next page that ""if he suffered a paper cut on a finger and saw blood, he would come into my office, looking pale."" She declares that ""Bill was incapable of engendering a cliché, in deed as well as in word."" But then she puts the most toe-curling clichés into his mouth: ""Why am I more ghost than man?"" Or: ""We must arrest our love in midflight. And we fix it forever as of today, a point of pure light that will reach into eternity."" (File that under Romantic Effusions We Doubt Ever Got Uttered.) Nor is Ross incapable of a melodramatic cliché herself. ""Why can't we just live, just live ?"" she cries in anguish when she and Shawn, walking hand in hand out of Central Park, chance to see Shawn's wife slowly making her way down the block with a burden of packages. 

          And what does she think of Mrs. Shawn? ""I found her to be sensitive and likeable."" Plus, she could ""do a mean Charleston."" There is nothing more poignant than the image of an openly cheated-upon and humiliated wife doing ""a mean Charleston."" 

         William Shawn's indispensability as an editor is amply manifest in Ross' memoir. Word repetition? ""Whatever reporting Bill asked me to do turned out to be both challenging and fun. ... For me, reporting and writing for the magazine was fun, pure fun. ... It was never 'work' for me. It was fun."" Even in praising his skill as an editor, she betrays the presence of its absence. ""All writers, of course, have needed the one called the 'editor,' who singularly, almost mystically, embodies the many-faceted, unique life force infusing the entire enchilada."" Nice touch, that enchilada. 

         When cocktail party malcontents mocked Shawn's New Yorker in the late '70s and early '80s, they would make fun of such things as E.J. Kahn's five-part series on ""Grains of the World"" or Elizabeth Drew's supposedly soporific reporting from Washington. But Ved Mehta was always the butt of the worst abuse. Shawn was allowing him to publish an autobiography in the pages of the magazine that was mounting up to millions of words over the years, and the very idea of it seemed to bore people silly. After the publication of two early installments, ""Daddyji"" and ""Mamaji,"" each the length of a book, one critic cried: ""Enoughji!"" 

         But it kept coming. And I, for one, was grateful. Here was a boy growing up in Punjab during the fall of the Raj and the Partition, a boy who had been blinded by meningitis at the age of 3, roller-skating through the back streets of Lahore as Sikhs slaughtered Hindus and Hindus slaughtered Muslims and civilization was collapsing and then, decades later, having made his way from India to an Arkansas school for the blind to Balliol College, Oxford, to The New Yorker , re-creating the whole thing in Proustian detail and better-than-Proustian prose ... ! 

          Mehta's multivolume autobiography, titled Continents of Exile , has loss as its overarching theme: loss of sight, of childhood, of home and country, and now--with this volume--loss of Mr. Shawn's New Yorker . The memoir takes us from the time the author was hired as a staff writer in the early '60s up to 1994, when he was ""terminated"" by the loathed Tina Brown in her vandalization of his cherished magazine. Mehta evidently loved William Shawn at least as much as Lillian Ross did, although his love was not requited in the same way. He likens the revered editor to the character Prince Myshkin in The Idiot : innocent and vulnerable, someone who must be protected. And long-suffering, one might infer: ""He was so careful of not hurting anyone's feelings that he often listened to utterly fatuous arguments for hours on end."" 

         Like Ross, Mehta struggles to express William Shawn's ineffable virtues. ""It is as if, Mehta, he were beyond our human conception,"" Janet Flanner tells him once to calm him down. At times I wondered whether the author, in his ecstasies of devotion, had not inadvertently committed plagiarism. His words on Mr. Shawn sound suspiciously like those of Mr. Pooter on his boss Mr. Perkupp in The Diary of a Nobody . Compare. Mehta on Shawn: ""His words were so generous that I could scarcely find my tongue, even to thank him."" Pooter on Perkupp: ""My heart was too full to thank him."" Mehta: ""I started saying to myself compulsively, 'I wish Mr. Shawn would ring,' at the oddest times of the day or night. ... How I longed for the parade of proofs, the excitement of rewriting and perfecting!"" Pooter: ""Mr. Perkupp, I will work night and day to serve you!"" 

         I am not sure I have made it sound this way so far, but Mehta's book is completely engrossing--the most enjoyable book, I think, I have ever reviewed. It oozes affection and conviction, crackles with anger, and is stuffed with thumping good stories. Many are about Mehta's daft colleagues at The New Yorker , such as the guy in the next office: 

         His door was always shut, but I could hear him through the wall that separated his cubicle from mine typing without pause. ... Even the changing of the paper in the typewriter seemed somehow to be incorporated into the rhythmic rat-tat-tat ... year after year went by to the sound of his typing but without a word from his typewriter appearing in the magazine. 

         Or the great and eccentric Irish writer Maeve Breenan, who fetched up as a bag lady. Or the legendary St. Clair McKelway, whose decisive breakdown came when he hailed a cab and prevailed upon the driver to take him to the New Yorker office at 24 West 43 rd St. ""O.K., Mac, if that's what you want."" He was in Boston at the time. (McKelway later told Mehta that if the cabby had not called him ""Mac,"" his nickname, an alarm might have gone off in his head.) 

         Mehta's writerly persona, a disarming mixture of the feline and the naive, is perfect for relating the little scandals that worried The New Yorker in the late '70s (plagiarism, frozen turbot), the drama of finding a worthy candidate to succeed the aging Shawn as editor, the purchase of the magazine by the evil Si Newhouse (""We all took fright"") and the resultant plague of Gottliebs and Florios visited upon it, and what he sees as the final debacle: Tinaji. 

          Lillian Ross, by contrast, takes a rather cheerful view of the Brown dispensation. Indeed, the new editor even coaxed Ross into re-joining the magazine, just as she was booting Mehta out. ""I found that she possessed--under the usual disguises--her own share of Bill's kind of naivete, insight, and sensitivity,"" Ross says of Brown. ""She, too, 'got it.' "" A few months after Brown was appointed editor, Shawn died at the age of 85. He had long since stopped reading his beloved magazine, in sorrow and relief. That's if you believe Mehta. Ross assures us that Mr. Shawn was reading Tina Brown's New Yorker ""with new interest"" in the weeks prior to his death. 

         Has Tina Brown betrayed the legacy of William Shawn, as Mehta fiercely believes, or has she continued and built upon it, as Ross is evidently convinced? Have the changes she has wrought enlivened a stodgy magazine or vulgarized a dignified one--or both? These are weighty questions, and one is of course loath to compromise one's life chances by hazarding unripe opinions in a public forum such as this.

THE LITTLE RED BAG
By JERRY SOHL

About an hour out of San Francisco on the flight to Los Angeles, I made
 the discovery. I had finished reading the
Chronicle
, folded and put
 it beside me, turned and looked out the window, expecting to see the
 San Joaquin Valley but finding only a sea of clouds instead. So I
 returned my attention to the inside of the plane, to the overstuffed
 gray-haired woman asleep beside me, to the backs of heads in seats
 before me, across the aisle to other heads, and down to the blonde.


 I had seen her in the concourse and at the gate, a shapely thing. Now
 she had crossed her legs and I was privileged to view a trim ankle and
 calf, and her profile as she stared moodily across the aisle and out a
 window where there was nothing to see.


 I slid my eyes past her to others. A crossword-puzzle worker, a
 togetherness-type-magazine reader.


 Inventory completed, I went back to looking at the clouds, knowing I
 should be thinking about the printing order I was going to Los Angeles
 for, and not wanting to.


 So I started going through the purse of the woman next to me. Perhaps
 that sounds bad. It wasn't. I'd been doing it for years and nobody ever
 complained.


 It started when I was a kid, this business of being able to explore
 the insides of things like purses and sealed boxes and locked drawers
 and—well, human beings. But human beings aren't worth the trouble.
 It's like swimming through spaghetti. And I've got to stay away from
 electric wires. They hurt. Now don't ask me
how
they hurt.


 Maybe you think it's fun. For the most part, it really isn't. I always
 knew what was in Christmas presents before I unwrapped them, and
 therefore Christmas was always spoiled for me as a kid. I can't feel
 the color of anything, just its consistency. An apple senses about the
 same as a potato, except for the core and the stem. I can't even tell
 if there's writing on a piece of paper. So you see it isn't much. Just
 the feel of shapes, the hardnesses and softnesses. But I've learned to
 become pretty good at guessing.


 Like this woman next to me. She had a short, cylindrical metal object
 in her purse with waxlike stuff inside it—a lipstick. A round, hard
 object with dust inside—a compact. Handkerchief, chewing gum, a small
 book, probably an address book, money in a change purse—a few bills
 and coins. Not much else.


 I was a little disappointed. I've run across a gun or two in my time.
 But I never say anything.
I learned the wisdom of keeping my mouth shut in the fourth grade when
 Miss Winters, a stern, white-haired disciplinarian, ordered me to eat
 my sack lunch in the classroom with her instead of outside with some
 of the other kids. This was the punishment for some minor infraction.
 Lunchtime was nearly over and we'd both finished eating; she said she'd
 be gone for a few moments and that I was to erase the blackboard during
 her absence, which I dutifully did.


 Class had hardly resumed when she started looking around the desk for
 her favorite mechanical pencil, asking if any of us had seen it, and
 looking straight at me. I didn't want her to think I had taken it while
 she was out of the room, so I probed the contents of her purse, which
 she always kept in the upper right drawer of her desk.


 ""It's in your purse,"" I blurted out.


 I was sent home with a stinging note.


 Since then I've kept quiet. At one time I assumed everybody was able
 to sense. I've known better for years. Still, I wonder how many other
 people are as close-mouthed about their special gift as I am about mine.


 I used to think that some day I'd make a lot of money out of it, but
 how? I can't read thoughts. I can't even be sure what some of the
 things I sense in probing really are.


 But I've learned to move things. Ever so little. A piece of paper. A
 feather. Once I stopped one of those little glass-enclosed light or
 heat-powered devices with vanes you see now and then in a jeweler's
 window. And I can stop clocks.


 Take this morning, for example. I had set my alarm for five-thirty
 because I had to catch the seven o'clock plane at San Francisco
 International Airport. This being earlier than I usually get up, it
 seems all I did during the night was feel my way past the escapement
 and balance wheel to see where the notch for the alarm was. The last
 time I did it there was just the merest fraction of an inch between the
 pawl and the notch. So I sighed and moved to the balance wheel and its
 delicate ribbon of spiraling steel. I hung onto the wheel, exerting
 influence to decrease the restoring torque.


 The wheel slowed down until there was no more ticking. It took quite
 a bit of effort, as it always does, but I did it, as I usually do. I
 can't stand the alarm.


 When I first learned to do this, I thought I had it made. I even went
 to Las Vegas to try my hand, so to speak, with the ratchets and pawls
 and cams and springs on the slot machines. But there's nothing delicate
 about a slot machine, and the spring tensions are too strong. I dropped
 quite a lot of nickels before I finally gave up.


 So I'm stuck with a talent I've found little real use for. Except that
 it amuses me. Sometimes. Not like this time on the plane.


 The woman beside me stirred, sat up suddenly and looked across me out
 the window. ""Where are we?"" she asked in a surprised voice. I told her
 we were probably a little north of Bakersfield. She said, ""Oh,"" glanced
 at her wristwatch and sank back again.


 Soon the stewardesses would bring coffee and doughnuts around, so I
 contented myself with looking at the clouds and trying to think about
 Amos Magaffey, who was purchasing agent for a Los Angeles amusement
 chain, and how I was going to convince him our printing prices were
 maybe a little higher but the quality and service were better. My mind
 wandered below where I was sitting, idly moving from one piece of
 luggage to another, looking for my beat-up suitcase. I went through
 slips and slippers, lingerie and laundry, a jig saw puzzle and a
 ukulele.


 I never did find my suitcase because I found the bomb first.
The bomb was in a small bag—a woman's bag judging by the soft,
 flimsy things you'd never find in a man's—and I didn't know it was a
 bomb right away. I thought it was just a clock, one of those small,
 quiet alarms. I was going to pass it by and go on, but what held me
 was that something was taped to it. By the feel, I knew it must be
 electrician's tape. Interested and curious, I explored the clock more
 closely, found two wires. One went to a battery and the other to hard
 round cylinders taped together. The hairs stood up at the base of my
 neck when I suddenly realized what it was.


 The clock's balance wheel was rocking merrily. Quickly I went up past
 the train of gears to the alarm wheel. If this was anything like my own
 alarm clock, this one had something like ten minutes to go.


 It was forty minutes to Burbank and Lockheed Air Terminal.


 My mind was churning when I turned from the window to look around
 at the unconcerned passengers, the woman at my side asleep again. I
 thought: Which one of these.... No, none of them would know it was
 there. I glanced out the window again; clouds were still in the way.
 We'd be leaving the valley for the mountain range north of Los Angeles
 soon, if we hadn't left it already. No place to land the plane there.


 But of course that had been the plan!


 My heart was beating in jackhammer rhythm; my mouth was dry and my mind
 was numb. Tell somebody about the bomb before it's too late! No, they'd
 think I put it there. Besides, what good would it do? There would be
 panic and they'd never get the plane down in time—if they believed me.


 ""Sir."" My head jerked around. The stewardess stood in the aisle,
 smiling, extending a tray to me, a brown plastic tray bearing a small
 paper cup of tomato juice, a cup of coffee, a cellophane-wrapped
 doughnut, paper spoon, sugar and dehydrated cream envelopes, and a
 napkin.


 I goggled at her, managed to croak, ""No, thanks."" She gave me an odd
 look and moved along. My seatmate had accepted hers and was tearing at
 the cellophane. I couldn't bear to watch her.


 I closed my eyes, forced my mind back to the luggage compartment, spent
 a frantic moment before I found the bag again. I had to stop that
 balance wheel, just as I stopped my alarm clock every morning. I tried
 to close everything off—the throb of engines, the rush of air, the
 woman sipping coffee noisily beside me—and I went into the clock and
 surrounded the seesawing wheel. When it went forward, I pulled it back;
 when it went back, I pulled it forward. I struggled with it, and it was
 like trying to work with greasy hands, and I was afraid I wasn't going
 to be able to stop it.


 Then, little by little, it started to slow its beat. But I could not
 afford to relax. I pushed and pulled and didn't dare release my hold
 until it came to a dead stop.


 ""Anything the matter?""


 My eyelids flew open and I looked into the eyes of the woman next to
 me. There was sugar from the doughnut around her mouth and she was
 still chewing.


 ""No,"" I said, letting out my breath. ""I'm all right.""


 ""You were moaning, it sounded like. And you kept moving your head back
 and forth.""


 ""Must have been dreaming,"" I said as I rang for the stewardess. When
 she came I told her I'd take some of that coffee now. No, nothing else,
 just coffee. I didn't tell her how much I needed it. I sat there clammy
 with sweat until she returned. Coffee never tasted so good.
All right, so I had stopped the bomb's timer. My mind raced ahead to
 the landing. When they unloaded the luggage, the balance wheel would
 start again. I wouldn't be able to stay with it, keeping it still.
 I considered telling the authorities as soon as we landed, or maybe
 calling in ahead, but wouldn't that just bring suspicion, questions.
 Maybe I could convince them I could stop a clock—but not before the
 bomb exploded. And then what? My secret would be out and my life would
 be changed. I'd be a man not to be trusted, a prying man, a man
 literally with gimlet eyes.


 Mountain crags jutted through the clouds. We were in the range north of
 the city. Here and there were clear spots and I could see roads below,
 but there were also clouds far above us. It was very beautiful, but it
 was also very bumpy, and we started to slip and slide.


 To my horror I found that the balance wheel was rocking again. Closing
 my eyes and gritting my teeth, I forced my senses to the wheel, tugging
 and pulling and shoving and pushing until it finally stopped.


 A jab in the shoulder. I jumped, startled.


 ""Your cup,"" my seat partner said, pointing.


 I looked down at the coffee cup I had crushed in my hands. Then I
 looked up into the eyes of the stewardess. I handed it to her. She took
 it without a word and went away.


 ""Were you really asleep that time?""


 ""Not really,"" I said. I was tempted to tell the woman I was subject to
 fits, but I didn't.


 It was only a few minutes to landing, but they became the longest
 minutes of my life as time after time I stopped the rocking wheel when
 the plane dipped and bumped to a landing.


 Leaving the apron with the other passengers, I tried to walk as
 unconcernedly as they through the exit gate. I would have liked walking
 through the terminal and out the entrance and away, but I could not. I
 had my suitcase to get, for one thing. The damned bomb was the other.
 So I strolled out into the concourse again to look at the plane and
 watch the baggagemen at work, transferring the luggage to two airfield
 carts. They weren't as careful as I would have been.


 It was impossible to tell from this distance just which bag contained
 the bomb; I could hardly identify my own scarred suitcase. The
 assortment of bags—a strange conglomeration of sizes and colors—was
 packed in some places six deep, and it rolled toward the gate where
 I was standing. I didn't know whether to stay or run, imagining the
 balance wheel now happily rocking again. The load went past me down a
 ramp to the front of the air terminal where the luggage was unloaded
 and placed in a long rack. I went with it.


 There was a flurry of ticket matching, hands grabbing for suitcases,
 and a general exodus on the part of my fellow passengers, too fast to
 determine who had got the one with the bomb. Now all that was left was
 the attendant and I had two bags—my own battered veteran of years, and
 a fine new red overnight case, small enough to be the one.


 I lit a cigarette, reached out. Inside were a woman's things and—a
 clock. The escapement was clicking vigorously.


 I didn't moan this time. I just closed my eyes, stretched toward
 and grabbed the balance wheel I was getting to know like my own. I
 entered into a union with it so strong that after I had reduced it to
 immobility, it was like waking when I opened my eyes.
The baggage claim attendant was staring at me. For only a moment I
 stared back. Then I quickly reached for my baggage check and presented
 it to him. His hand hovered over the handle of the little red bag and I
 was ready to yell at him. But then, matching numbers on the tags with
 his eyes, his hand grasped the handle of my own suitcase and pushed it
 toward me.


 ""Thanks,"" I said, taking it. I glanced ever so casually toward the
 remaining bag. ""One left over, eh?""


 ""Yeah."" He was so bored I was tempted to tell him what was in it. But
 he was eying me with a ""well-why-don't-you-get-along?"" look.


 I said, ""What happens if nobody claims it?""


 ""Take it inside. Why?""


 He was getting too curious. ""Oh, I just wondered, that's all.""


 I stepped on my cigarette and walked toward the air terminal entrance
 and put my suitcase on the stone steps there. A redcap came hurrying
 over.


 ""Cab?""


 I shook my head. ""Just waiting.""


 Just waiting for somebody to pick up a bomb.


 I lit another cigarette and glanced now and then toward the baggage
 claim area. The red bag was still there. All sorts of theories ran
 through my head as to why it should still be there, and none satisfied
 me.


 I should not have been there, that much I knew; I should be with a
 man named Amos Magaffey on Sixth Street at ten o'clock, discussing
 something very mundane, the matter of a printing order. But what could
 I do? If I left the airport, the attendant would eventually take the
 bag inside and there would be an explosion, and I wouldn't be able to
 live with myself.


 No. I had to stay to keep the balance wheel stationary until—until
 what?


 A man in tan gabardine, wearing a police cap and badge, walked out of
 the entrance to stand on the stone steps beside me while he put on a
 pair of dark glasses. A member of the airport police detail. I could
 tell him. I could take him down to the little red bag and explain the
 whole thing. Then it would be his baby and I would be off on my own
 business.


 But he moved on down the steps, nodded at the redcap, and started
 across the street to the parking area. I could have called to him,
 ""Hey, officer, let me tell you about a bomb in a little red bag."" But
 I didn't. I didn't because I caught a movement at the baggage claim
 counter out of the side of my eye.


 The attendant had picked up the bag and was walking with it up the ramp
 to the rear of the air terminal. Picking up my own suitcase, I went
 inside in time to see him enter through a side door and deposit the bag
 on the scales at the airline desk and say something to the clerk. The
 clerk nodded and moved the bag to the rear room.


 I could visualize the balance wheel once again rocking like crazy. How
 many minutes—or seconds—were left? I was sweating when I moved to the
 counter, and it wasn't because of the sunshine I'd been soaking in. I
 had to get as close to the bag as I could if I was going to stop the
 clock again.


 ""Can I help you?"" the clerk asked.


 ""No. I'm waiting for someone.""


 I turned my back to him, put down my suitcase, leaned against the
 counter and reached out for the wheel. I found I could reach the
 device, but it was far away. When I tried to dampen it, the wheel
 escaped my grasp.


 ""Do you have my suitcase?""


 I blinked my eyes open and looked around. The blonde in the plane stood
 there looking very fresh and bright and unconcerned. In her right hand
 she had a green baggage claim check.


 The clerk took it, nodded, and in a moment brought out the overnight
 case and set it on the scales. The girl thanked him, picked it up,
 glanced at me indifferently, and then started for the entrance with it.


 ""Just a moment,"" I found myself saying, grabbing my bag and hurrying
 after her.
At her side and a little ahead of her, I said, ""Listen to me.""


 She looked annoyed and increased her stride toward the door.


 ""It's a matter of life or death,"" I said. I wanted to wrest the bag
 from her and hurl it out through the doorway into the street, but I
 restrained myself.


 She stopped and stared. I noticed a short, fat man in a rumpled
 suitcoat and unpressed pants staring, too. Ignoring him, I said,
 ""Please put the bag down. Over there."" I indicated a spot beside a
 telephone booth where it would be out of the way.


 She didn't move. She just said, ""Why?""


 ""For God's sake!"" I took the case. She offered no resistance. I put her
 bag and mine next to the booth. When I turned around she was standing
 there looking at me as if I had gone out of my mind. Her eyes were blue
 and brown-flecked, very pretty eyes, and my thought at the moment was,
 I'm glad the bomb didn't go off; these eyes wouldn't be looking at me
 or anything else right now if it had.


 ""I've got to talk to you. It's very important.""


 The girl said, ""Why?"" I was beginning to think it was the only word she
 knew. At the same time I was wondering why anyone would want to kill
 someone so lovely.


 ""I'll explain in a moment. Please stand right here while I make a
 telephone call."" I moved toward the phone booth, paused and said, ""And
 don't ask me why.""


 She gave me a speculative look.


 I must not have seemed a complete idiot because she said, ""All right,
 but—""


 I didn't listen for the rest. I went into the booth, closed the door,
 pretended to drop a coin and dial a number. But all the time I was in
 there, I was reaching out through the glass for the clock. At this
 range it wasn't difficult to stop the balance wheel.


 Just the same, when I came out I was wringing wet.


 ""Now will you please tell me what this is all about?"" she said stiffly.


 ""Gladly. Let me buy you a cup of coffee and I'll explain.""


 She glanced at the bags. I told her they'd be all right. We followed
 the short, fat man into the coffee shop.


 Over coffee I explained it all to her, how I had this extrasensory
 ability, how she was the first person I had ever revealed it to, and
 how I had discovered what was in her overnight bag.


 During the telling, her untouched coffee grew a skin, her face grew
 pale, her eyes grew less curious and more troubled. There were tears
 there when I finished. I asked her who put the bomb in her bag.


 ""Joe did,"" she said in a toneless voice, not looking at me any more but
 staring vacantly across the room. ""Joe put it there."" Behind her eyes
 she was reliving some recent scene.


 ""Who is Joe?""


 ""My husband."" I thought she was going to really bawl, but she got
 control again. ""This trip was his idea, my coming down here to visit my
 sister."" Her smile was bleak. ""I see now why he wanted to put in those
 books. I'd finished packing and was in the bathroom. He said he'd put
 in some books we'd both finished reading—for my sister. That's when he
 must have put the—put it in there.""


 I said gently, ""Why would he want to do a thing like that?""


 ""I don't know."" She shook her head. ""I just don't know."" And she was
 close to bawling again. Then she recovered and said, ""I'm not sure I
 want to know."" I admired her for saying it. Joe must have been crazy.


 ""It's all right now?"" she asked.


 I nodded. ""As long as we don't move it.""


 I told her I didn't know how much more time there was, that I'd been
 thinking it over and that the only way out seemed to be to tell the
 airport policeman. After I explained it to her, the girl—she said her
 name was Julia Claremont—agreed to tell him she thought there was a
 bomb in her bag, that she had noticed a ticking and had become worried
 because she knew she hadn't packed a clock. It wasn't good, but it
 would have to do.


 ""We've got to get it deactivated,"" I said, watching the fat man pay for
 his coffee and leave. ""The sooner the better.""
I finished my coffee in one gulp and went to pay the bill with her.
 I asked her why she didn't claim the bag at the same time the other
 people had. She said she had called her sister and the phone was busy
 for a long while.


 ""She was supposed to meet me, and when she wasn't here, I got worried.
 She said she isn't feeling well and asked me to take a cab."" She smiled
 a little. It was a bright, cheery thing. I had the feeling it was all
 for me. ""That's where I was going when you caught up with me.""


 It had become a very nice day. But the bottom dropped out of it again
 when we reached the lobby.


 The two bags weren't there.


 I ran to the entrance and nearly collided with the redcap.


 ""See anybody go out of here with a little red bag and an old battered
 suitcase?""


 ""Bag? Suitcase?"" he mumbled. Then he became excited. ""Why, a man just
 stepped out of here—"" He turned to look down the street. ""That's him.""


 The dumpy man I'd seen was walking off; Julia's bag in his right hand,
 mine in his left. He seemed in no hurry.


 ""Hey!"" I shouted, starting toward him.


 The man turned, took one look at me, and started to run. He came
 abreast an old gray, mud-spattered coupe, ran around, opened the door
 and threw both bags into the rear seat as he got in.


 The car was a hundred feet away and gathering speed by the time I
 reached where it had been parked. I watched it for a moment, then
 walked back to the entranceway where Julia was standing with the
 redcap, who said, ""That man steal them suitcases?""


 ""That he did,"" I said.


 Just then the airport policeman started across the street from the
 parking lot. Redcap said, ""Better tell him about it.""


 The policeman was sympathetic and concerned. He said, ""We'd better get
 over to the office.""


 But we never left the spot because an explosion some blocks distant
 shattered the air. Julia's hand grasped my arm. Hard.


 ""Jets,"" the redcap said, eying the sky.


 ""I don't know,"" the policeman said. ""Didn't sound much like a jet to
 me.""


 We stood there. I could visualize the wreckage of an old gray coupe
 in the middle of a street, but I couldn't visualize the driver. That
 was all right. I didn't want to see him. I didn't know what Julia was
 thinking.


 She said, ""About those bags,"" and looked at me.


 The officer said, ""Yes, miss?""


 ""I—I don't care about mine. I didn't have much of anything in it.""


 ""I feel the same way,"" I said. ""Would it be all right if we didn't
 bother to report it?""


 ""Well,"" the policeman said, ""I can't
make
you report it.""


 ""I'd rather not then,"" Julia said. She turned to me. ""I'd like some
 air. Can't we walk a little?""


 ""Sure,"" I said.


 We started down the street, her arm in mine, as the air began to fill
 with the distant sounds of sirens.

Slate,"Dole vs. the
Times
For several weeks now, pundits have debated how Bob Dole would exit the stage. Would he depart on a negative note about his opponent or a positive one about himself? Would he leave with anger or with humor? In the past several days, the issue has been settled. Dole, it appears, will end his political career raging against the New York Times . 

         Dole's spat with the gray lady went public on Thursday, Oct. 24. In New Orleans, Dole charged the paper with ignoring a story about a Miami drug dealer who got invited to the White House. ""This is a disgrace,"" Dole insisted. ""I doubt if you even read it in the New York Times . They probably put it in the want ads. They don't put any anti-Clinton stories in the New York Times . Only anti-Dole stories in the New York Times ."" Dole repeated his attack for the next five days. ""We are not going to let the media steal this election,"" he told a crowd in Dallas on Friday. ""This country belongs to the people, not the New York Times ."" On Saturday, in Visalia, Calif., he added, ""I know that with a crowd this size, the New York Times will write not many people showed up, but the other papers will get it right."" 

         On Sunday (the day the Times endorsed Clinton), Dole called the paper ""the apologist for President Clinton for the last four years and an arm of the Democratic National Committee."" In a CNN interview broadcast Monday, Dole said the Times ""might as well be part of the Democratic Party. ... They hammer us on a daily basis. We make a major speech, they bury it back on section D. They put a front-page story that, well, Bob Dole and Jack Kemp didn't get along together 12 years ago."" On Tuesday, Dole was still at it, referring to the 28 words of the 10th Amendment, and quipping, ""That's about what I got in the New York Times today."" 

         The Times has reacted to this assault by highhandedly quoting everything and explaining none of it, leaving its readers baffled as to why the Republican nominee is so upset at the paper. In fact, Dole's fury at the Times is hardly news to those who work at the paper. According to Katharine Seelye, who has covered Dole since the beginning of his campaign, the complaints date from December 1995, when Dole staff members first protested that she had misunderstood the candidate's position on abortion. The real bitterness, however, began in May, when the paper played what Dole aides billed as a major address about welfare on Page 19 of the business section. Since then, campaign honchos have peppered the paper's reporters and editors with constant phone calls and letters complaining about unfair treatment. 

         Reporters traveling with Dole caught a glimpse of the enmity Oct. 9, when Nelson Warfield, Dole's press secretary, staged a public confrontation with Seelye. The candidate, Warfield told reporters waiting to board the campaign plane, had just come from an appearance on G. Gordon Liddy's radio show. Why, Seelye asked, weren't reporters told about the appearance in advance? According to reporters present, Warfield snapped that it wouldn't make any difference because the Times would get the story wrong anyway. Then, on the plane, Warfield walked back to the press section and grandly served Seelye with a copy of a letter from Communications Director John Buckley to her boss, Times Washington Editor Andrew Rosenthal. 

         That letter, which has fallen into the hands of Slate, protests Seelye's coverage of a speech the previous day. Dole, in New Jersey, had talked about Clinton being AWOL in the drug war. ""Where has he been for four years? How many hundreds of thousands of young people started drugs?"" Dole said. ""Three million have started smoking while he was playing around with smoking and all this stuff finally in an election year."" Seelye's front-page story reported that ""Mr. Dole accused the President of 'playing around' while the drug war raged out of control."" Buckley complains that the story ""could lead the reader to believe that Dole was talking about a very different kind of 'playing around'--something he did not say, and something he would not say."" The letter continues: ""Since May, I have been pointing out to you a problem we see with the accuracy and understanding of context revealed in Kit's reporting,"" going on to assert that ""Seelye has misquoted Dole on numerous occasions and done so in a manner that distorted the accuracy of her assertions and your coverage."" 

          No Dole staff would be quoted by name for this story, but speaking on background, a senior campaign official elaborated upon the complaint. ""They've just done a miserable job throughout this campaign,"" the official said. ""The coverage of Dole has been excessively bitchy from day one, in addition to having a number of extraordinary factual problems."" With Seelye, the official says, the problem is ""not being able to transcribe a tape accurately."" With Adam Nagourney, the Times ' other reporter covering Dole full time since the summer, ""the problem is an incredible focus on the little picture as opposed to the big picture."" As an example, the official cites a September story in which Nagourney lumped together Dole's fall from a platform in Chico, Calif., and his mistaken reference to the ""Brooklyn"" Dodgers as ""a rough stretch of politicking."" Other than those two episodes, the official says, Dole actually had a great week. The campaign's complaint extends to unequal treatment--a nine-part series on Clinton's record, which the official describes as ""the softest portrait since they invented black velvet""--and the Times perpetually underestimating the size of Dole crowds. ""Clinton even gets better photographs,"" the official contends. 

          Rosenthal, who has direct responsibility for campaign coverage at the Times , professes bewilderment at these complaints. ""We don't make editorial judgments based on disposition to be tough on Bob Dole or nice to Bob Dole,"" he says. On the specifics, Rosenthal says that the Times ran an editor's note acknowledging that it shouldn't have truncated the ""playing around"" quote. He points out that the Times ran its story on the Miami drug dealer who visited the White House the same day Dole accused the paper of not covering it. As for the nine-part series on Clinton, Rosenthal says it is the long-standing practice of the paper to do a lengthy series on the incumbent's record. ""If Dole wins and runs again in 2000, he will get nine-part series too,"" he says. 

          ""Ithink we have been tough on him,"" Seelye says. This stems, however, not from any bias, she says, but from the campaign's own internal problems. Dole's campaign has been especially ""porous,"" with aides emulating the proverbial seafaring rats. This is true enough--in recent days ex-strategist Don Sipple has trashed the campaign on the record. But there's another point, too. Contrary to Buckley's charge that she misquotes Dole, Seelye routinely makes Dole look ridiculous by quoting him all too accurately, depicting him in what one colleague calls a ""cinema veritÃ© "" style. Famous for going over and over her tape recordings on the campaign plane, Seelye manages to get every Dole mumble, repetition, and verbal miscue down. For instance, in her Oct. 26 story reporting Dole's attack on the Times , Seelye writes: 

         ""In Phoenix on Friday night, he had a delightful time drawing out his vowels as he described financial contributions to the Clinton campaign. ""From Indoneeesia,"" he said. ""Yeah. From INdiaaaaah. Some fellow named Gandhi out there. He owes $10,000 in back taxes, but he found $300,000 to give to the Clinton campaign. And now Gandhi is gaaaawn. Gaaaaandhi, gone gone gone. They can't find him."" 

         Two days later, she quoted Dole in another story: ""They've turned the White House into something else, I don't know what it is. It's the animal house! It's the animal house!"" Most reporters would write, Bob Dole yesterday compared the White House to an ""animal house,"" sparing the exclamation points, and making him sound at least compos mentis. 

         But though unflattering, Seelye's Mametizing of Bob Dole can hardly be called unfair. It is not as if the Times cleans up Clinton's quotes; the president simply observes the rules of syntax most of the time. Something similar may be happening with the pictures. After four years, Clinton has learned how to avoid looking unpresidential. He no longer allows himself to be photographed wearing too-short running shorts, and he avoids pulling faces in public. Dole, who is simply less photogenic, is an easier victim for picture editors--who, like their editorial counterparts, have a strong bias against dullness. Take, for instance, the two pictures shown above. The front-page picture the Times ran the day after the second presidential debate does make Dole look like a decomposing monster. But unlike the picture in the Washington Post the same day, it captures the spirit of the event, with Dole grimly taking the offensive and Clinton watching warily but standing aside from the attacks. 

          Dole sounds absurd when he alleges that the paper that broke Whitewater and the story of the first lady's commodities trades has not been aggressive in pursuing Clinton scandals. All sorts of potential Dole scandals have been soft-pedaled by the media, including the Times , because he is so far behind. It's true that coverage of Clinton on the campaign trail has been somewhat softer than the coverage of Dole, as even other Times reporters acknowledge. But the explanation is institutional, not ideological. The press, as many have complained, overemphasizes the ""horse race"" aspect of politics. As a side effect of that disease, reporters have excessive respect for a well-run campaign. (In 1988, Republican George Bush benefited from this phenomenon.) A cruder reality is that reporters need to have a relationship with Clinton after Tuesday. 

         None of these factors, though, is unique to the Times . So why is Dole singling it out? Dole's attacks on the Times have the appearance of being an exercise in populist demagogy. In one of his great cue-card reading remarks, Dole tried to explain his recent attacks on CNN the other night by saying, ""I like the media. They don't like them in the South."" But this pat explanation doesn't entirely make sense. Red meat for right-wing crowds doesn't help Dole with the centrist voters he would need to turn around in order to make the miraculous happen. And in fact, according to a senior Dole aide, the attacks are heartfelt on the candidate's part. Dole has been going after the Times over the objections of advisers who have been telling him there's no percentage in picking fights with the press. 

         But if Dole is attacking the Times because he is truly furious and not because he thinks it will help him get elected, what is he so angry about? The answer, I think, is that there has always been a Nixonian streak in Bob Dole, by which I mean a part of him which feels shut out of the closed circle of the Eastern establishment. At the Republican convention, Dole blasted the Clinton administration as a ""corps of the elite who never grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned."" That phrase recalled an attack he made on the press long ago, in the days of Watergate, when he accused the Washington Post of being in bed with George McGovern. ""There is a cultural and social affinity between the McGovernites and the Post executives and editors,"" Dole said then. ""They belong to the same elite: They can be found living cheek-by-jowl in the same exclusive chic neighborhoods, and hob-nobbing at the same Georgetown parties."" The deeper story here isn't whether Dole was wrongly shunted onto D19 when he ought to have been on A1. It's his feelings, as he says goodbye to politics, about the people who get to decide.

misc-freesouls,"COMPLEXITY AND HUMANITY
We have all seen the images. Volunteers pitching in. People working day
 and night; coming up with the most ingenious, improvised solutions to
 everything from food and shelter to communications and security. Working
 together; patching up the fabric that is rent. Disaster, natural or
 otherwise, is a breakdown of systems. For a time, chaos reigns. For a
 time, what will happen in the next five minutes, five hours, and five
 days is unknown. All we have to rely on are our wits, fortitude, and
 common humanity
Contemporary life is not chaotic, in the colloquial sense we apply to
 disaster zones. It is, however, complex and rapidly changing; much more
 so than life was in the past; even the very near past. Life, of course,
 was never simple. But the fact that day-to-day behaviors in Shenzhen and
 Bangalore have direct and immediate effects on people from Wichita to
 Strasbourg, from Rio de Janeiro to Sydney, or that unscrupulous lenders
 and careless borrowers in the United States can upend economic
 expectations everywhere else in the world, no matter how carefully
 others have planned, means that there are many more moving parts that
 affect each other. And from this scale of practical effects, complexity
 emerges. New things too were ever under the sun; but the systematic
 application of knowledge to the creation of new knowledge, innovation to
 innovation, and information to making more information has become
 pervasive; and with it the knowledge that next year will be very
 different than this. The Web, after all, is less than a generation old.
These two features−the global scale of interdependence of human action,
 and the systematic acceleration of innovation, make contemporary life a
 bit like a slow motion disaster, in one important respect. Its very
 unpredictability makes it unwise to build systems that take too much
 away from what human beings do best: look, think, innovate, adapt,
 discuss, learn, and repeat. That is why we have seen many more systems
 take on a loose, human centric model in the last decade and a half: from
 the radical divergence of Toyota’s production system from the highly
 structured model put in place by Henry Ford, to the Internet’s radical
 departure from the AT&amp;T system that preceded it, and on to the way
 Wikipedia constructs human knowledge on the fly, incrementally, in ways
 that would have been seen, until recently, as too chaotic ever to work
 (and are still seen so be many). But it is time we acknowledge that
 systems work best by making work human.
Modern Times
Modern times were hard enough. Trains and planes, telegraph and
 telephone, all brought many people into the same causal space. The
 solution to this increased complexity in the late 19th, early 20th
 century was to increase the role of structure and improve its design.
 During the first two-thirds of the twentieth century, this type of
 rationalization took the form of ever-more complex managed systems, with
 crisp specification of roles, lines of authority, communication and
 control.
In business, this rationalization was typified by Fredrick Taylor’s
 Scientific Management, later embodied in Henry Ford’s assembly line. The
 ambition of these approaches was to specify everything that needed doing
 in minute detail, to enforce it through monitoring and rewards, and
 later to build it into the very technology of work−the assembly line.
 The idea was to eliminate human error and variability in the face of
 change by removing thinking to the system, and thus neutralizing the
 variability of the human beings who worked it. Few images captured that
 time, and what it did to humanity, more vividly than Charlie Chaplin’s
 assembly line worker in Modern Times.
At the same time, government experienced the rise of bureaucratization
 and the administrative state. Nowhere was this done more brutally than
 in the totalitarian states of mid-century. But the impulse to build
 fully-specified systems, designed by experts, monitored and controlled
 so as to limit human greed and error and to manage uncertainty, was
 basic and widespread. It underlay the development of the enormously
 successful state bureaucracies that responded to the Great Depression
 with the New Deal. It took shape in the Marshall Plan to pull Europe out
 of the material abyss into which it had been plunged by World War II,
 and shepherded Japan’s industrial regeneration from it. In technical
 systems too, we saw in mid-century marvels like the AT&amp;T telephone
 system and the IBM mainframe. For a moment in history, these large scale
 managed systems were achieving efficiencies that seemed to overwhelm
 competing models: from the Tennessee Valley Authority to Sputnik, from
 Watson’s IBM to General Motors. Yet, to list these paragons from today’s
 perspective is already to presage the demise of the belief in their
 inevitable victory.
The increasing recognition of the limits of command-and-control systems
 led to a new approach; but it turned out to be a retrenchment, not an
 abandonment, of the goal of perfect rationalization of systems design,
 which assumed much of the human away. What replaced planning and control
 in these systems was the myth of perfect markets. This was achieved
 through a hyper-simplification of human nature, wedded to mathematical
 modeling of what hyper-simplified selfish rational actors, looking only
 to their own interests, would do under diverse conditions. This approach
 was widespread and influential; it still is. And yet it led to such
 unforgettable gems as trying to understand why people do, or do not, use
 condoms by writing sentences like: “The expected utility (EU) of unsafe
 sex for m and for f is equal to the benefits (B) of unsafe sex minus its
 expected costs, and is given by EUm = B - C(1-Pm)(Pf) and EUf = B -
 C(1-Pf)(Pm),” and believing that you will learn anything useful about
 lust and desire, recklessness and helplessness, or how to slow down the
 transmission of AIDS. Only by concocting such a thin model of
 humanity−no more than the economists’ utility curve−and neglecting any
 complexities of social interactions that could not be conveyed through
 prices, could the appearance of rationalization be maintained. Like
 bureaucratic rationalization, perfect-market rationalization also had
 successes. But, like its predecessor, its limits as an approach to human
 systems design are becoming cleare
Work, Trust and Play
Pricing perfectly requires perfect information. And perfect information,
 while always an illusion, has become an ever receding dream in a world
 of constant, rapid change and complex global interactions. What we are
 seeing instead is the rise of human systems that increasingly shy away
 from either control or perfect pricing. Not that there isn’t control.
 Not that there aren’t markets. And not that either of these approaches
 to coordinating human action will disappear. But these managed systems
 are becoming increasingly interlaced with looser structures, which
 invite and enable more engaged human action by drawing on intrinsic
 motivations and social relations. Dress codes and a culture of play in
 the workplace in Silicon Valley, like the one day per week that Google
 employees can use to play at whatever ideas they like, do not exist to
 make the most innovative region in the United States a Ludic paradise,
 gratifying employees at the expense of productivity, but rather to
 engage the human and social in the pursuit of what is, in the long term,
 the only core business competency−innovation. Wikipedia has eclipsed all
 the commercial encyclopedias except Britannica not by issuing a large
 IPO and hiring the smartest guys in the room, but by building an open
 and inviting system that lets people learn together and pursue their
 passion for knowledge, and each other’s company.
The set of human systems necessary for action in this complex,
 unpredictable set of conditions, combining rationalization with human
 agency, learning and adaptation, is as different from managed systems
 and perfect markets as the new Toyota is from the old General Motors, or
 as the Internet now is from AT&amp;T then. The hallmarks of these newer
 systems are: (a) location of authority and practical capacity to act at
 the edges of the system, where potentialities for sensing the
 environment, identifying opportunities and challenges to action and
 acting upon them, are located; (b) an emphasis on the human: on trust,
 cooperation, judgment and insight; (c) communication over the lifetime
 of the interaction; and (d) loosely-coupled systems: systems in which
 the regularities and dependencies among objects and processes are less
 strictly associated with each other; where actions and interactions can
 occur through multiple systems simultaneously, have room to fail,
 maneuver, and be reoriented to fit changing conditions and new learning,
 or shift from one system to another to achieve a solution.
Consider first of all the triumph of Toyota over the programs of Taylor
 and Ford. Taylorism was typified by the ambition to measure and specify
 all human and material elements of the production system. The ambition
 of scientific management was to offer a single, integrated system where
 all human variance (the source of slothful shirking and inept error)
 could be isolated and controlled. Fordism took that ambition and
 embedded the managerial knowledge in the technological platform of the
 assembly line, guided by a multitude of rigid task specifications and
 routines. Toyota Production System, by comparison, has a substantially
 smaller number of roles that are also more loosely defined, with a
 reliance on small teams where each team member can perform all tasks,
 and who are encouraged to experiment, improve, fail, adapt, but above
 all communicate. The system is built on trust and a cooperative dynamic.
 The enterprise functions through a managerial control system, but also
 through social cooperation mechanisms built around teamwork and trust.
 However, even Toyota might be bested in this respect by the even more
 loosely coupled networks of innovation and supply represented by
 Taiwanese original-design manufacturers.
But let us also consider the system in question that has made this work
 possible, the Internet, and compare it to the design principles of the
 AT&amp;T network in its heyday. Unlike the Internet, AT&amp;T’s network was
 fully managed. Mid-century, the company even retained ownership of the
 phones at the endpoints, arguing that it needed to prohibit customers
 from connecting unlicensed phones to the system (ostensibly to ensure
 proper functioning of the networking and monitoring of customer
 behavior, although it didn’t hurt either that this policy effectively
 excluded competitors). This generated profit, but any substantial
 technical innovations required the approval of management and a
 re-engineering of the entire network. The Internet, on the other hand,
 was designed to be as general as possible. The network hardware merely
 delivers packets of data using standardized addressing information. The
 hard processing work−manipulating a humanly-meaningful communication (a
 letter or a song, a video or a software package) and breaking it up into
 a stream of packets−was to be done by its edge devices, in this case
 computers owned by users. This system allowed the breathtaking rate of
 innovation that we have seen, while also creating certain
 vulnerabilities in online security.
These vulnerabilities have led some to argue that a new system to manage
 the Internet is needed. We see first of all that doubts about trust and
 security on the Internet arise precisely because the network was
 originally designed for people who could more-or-less trust each other,
 and offloaded security from the network to the edges. As the network
 grew and users diversified, trust (the practical belief that other human
 agents in the system were competent and benign, or at least sincere)
 declined. This decline was met with arguments in favor of building
 security into the technical system, both at its core, in the network
 elements themselves, and at its periphery, through “trusted computing.”
 A “trusted computer” will, for example, not run a program or document
 that its owner wants to run, unless it has received authorization from
 some other locus: be it the copyright owner, the virus protection
 company, or the employer. This is thought to be the most completely
 effective means of preventing copyright infringement or system failure,
 and preserving corporate security (these are the main reasons offered
 for implementing such systems). Trusted computing in this form is the
 ultimate reversal of the human-centric, loosely-coupled design approach
 of the Internet. Instead of locating authority and capacity to act at
 the endpoints, where human beings are located and can make decisions
 about what is worthwhile, it implements the belief that
 machines−technical systems−are trustworthy, while their human users are
 malevolent, incompetent, or both.
Reintroducing the Human
Taylorism, the Bell system and trusted computing are all efforts to
 remove human agency from action and replace it with well-designed,
 tightly-bound systems. That is, the specifications and regularities of
 the system are such that they control or direct action and learning over
 time. Human agency, learning, communication and adaptation are minimized
 in managed systems, if not eliminated, and the knowledge in the system
 comes from the outside, from the designer, in the initial design over
 time, and through observation of the system’s performance by someone
 standing outside its constraints−a manager or systems designer. By
 contrast, loosely-coupled systems affirmatively eschew this level of
 control, and build in room for human agency, experimentation, failure,
 communication, learning and adaptation. Loose-coupling is central to the
 new systems. It is a feature of system design that leaves room for human
 agency over time, only imperfectly constraining and enabling any given
 action by the system itself. By creating such domains of human agency,
 system designers are accepting the limitations of design and foresight,
 and building in the possibilities of learning over time through action
 in the system, by agents acting within
To deal with the new complexity of contemporary life we need to
 re-introduce the human into the design of systems. We must put the soul
 back into the system. If years of work on artificial intelligence have
 taught us anything, it is that what makes for human insight is extremely
 difficult to replicate or systematize. At the center of these new
 systems, then, sits a human being who has a capacity to make judgments,
 experiment, learn and adapt. But enabling human agency also provides
 scope of action for human frailty. Although this idea is most alien to
 the mainstream of system design in the twentieth century, we must now
 turn our attention to building systems that support human sociality−our
 ability to think of others and their needs, and to choose for ourselves
 goals consistent with a broader social concern than merely our own
 self-interest. The challenge of the near future is to build systems that
 will allow us to be largely free to inquire, experiment, learn and
 communicate, that will encourage us to cooperate, and that will avoid
 the worst of what human beings are capable of, and elicit what is best.
 Free software, Wikipedia, Creative Commons and the thousands of emerging
 human practices of productive social cooperation in the networked
 information economy give us real existence proofs that human-centric
 systems can not merely exist, but thrive, as can the human beings and
 social relations that make them.

Grannie Annie, who wrote science fiction

 under the nom de plume of Annabella C. Flowers,

 had stumbled onto a murderous plot more

 hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.

 And the danger from the villain of the piece

 didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Fall 1944.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the
Spacemen's Club
in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the
 shoulder.


 ""Beg pardon, thir,"" he said with his racial lisp, ""thereth thome one to
 thee you in the main lounge."" His eyes rolled as he added, ""A lady!""


 A woman here...! The
Spacemen's
was a sanctuary, a rest club where
 in-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another
 voyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly
 enforced.


 I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main
 lounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.


 Grannie Annie!


 There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning
 on her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a
 voluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,
 tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were
 planted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in
 calm defiance.


 I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. ""Grannie Annie! I
 haven't seen you in two years.""


 ""Hi, Billy-boy,"" she greeted calmly. ""Will you please tell this
 fish-face to shut up.""


 The desk clerk went white. ""Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a
 friend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely
 againth the ruleth....""


 ""Okay, okay,"" I grinned. ""Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no
 one there at this hour.""


 In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey
 and Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed
 the drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:


 ""What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't
 allowed in the
Spacemen's
? What happened to the book you were
 writing?""


 ""Hold it, Billy-boy."" Laughingly she threw up both hands. ""Sure, I knew
 this place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what
 they are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.""


 She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be
 Annabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.
 But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's
 hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel
 in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.


 But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for
 more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers
 sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.


 One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime
 novels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a
 novel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag
 and hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two
 expeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.


 She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.


 ""What happened to
Guns for Ganymede
?"" I asked. ""That was the title of
 your last, wasn't it?""
Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly
 rolled herself a cigarette.


 ""It wasn't
Guns
, it was
Pistols
; and it wasn't
Ganymede
, it was
Pluto
.""


 I grinned. ""All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe
 and beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.""


 ""What else is there in science fiction?"" she demanded. ""You can't have
 your hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.""


 Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her
 feet.


 ""I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the
Satellite
Theater in ten
 minutes. Come on, you're going with me.""


 Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to
 the jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we
 drew up before the big doors of the
Satellite
.


 They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled
 colonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the
 muck,
zilcon
wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was
 packed with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity
 that made Swamp City the frontier post it is.


 In front was a big sign. It read:
ONE NIGHT ONLY

 DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS

 NINE GENIUSES

 THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF

 THE SYSTEM


 As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a
 tinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the
 front row.


 ""Sit here,"" she said. ""I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of
 the players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go
 somewhere and talk."" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the
 stage steps and disappeared in the wings.


 ""That damned fossilized dynamo,"" I muttered. ""She'll be the death of me
 yet.""


 The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the
 stage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian
 sat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The
 Mercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably
 uncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new
 improved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an
 Earthman operator.
A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and
 advanced to the footlights.


 ""People of Swamp City,"" he said, bowing, ""permit me to introduce
 myself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.""


 There was a roar of applause from the
Satellite
audience. When it had
 subsided, the man continued:


 ""As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary
 to give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are
 nine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting
 sets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.
 These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every
 question missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand

 ""One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match
 her wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of
 science fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.""


 From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place
 on the dais.


 The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his
 dials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to
 coalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his
 voice echoed through the theater:


 ""
Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?
""


 Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her
 hand. She said quietly:


 ""Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed
 tracto-car.""


 And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in
 the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian
 cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering
 bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,
 or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of
 the winner.


 It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had
 brought me here. And then I began to notice things.


 The audience in the
Satellite
seemed to have lost much of its
 original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the
 signal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.


 Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a
 general surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips
 were turned in a smile of satisfaction.


 When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving
 crowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident
 occurred.


 A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,
 dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an
 unpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of
 the Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to
 an earlier era.


 Someone shouted, ""Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!"" As one
 man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor
 was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,
 snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned
 into his mouth.


 Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men
 rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to
 shout derisive epithets.


 Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm
 and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read
 THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place
 was all but deserted.


 In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober
 eyes.


 ""Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?""


 I nodded. ""As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men
 ought to clamp down.""


 ""The I.P. men aren't strong enough.""


 She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh
 line about her usually smiling lips.


 ""What do you mean?""
For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,
 closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.


 ""My last book,
Death In The Atom
, hit the stands last January,""
 she began. ""When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'
 vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.
 Well, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so
 for this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six
 weeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra
 Karn....""


 ""Who?"" I interrupted.


 ""An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of
 Varsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about
 his adventures, and he told me plenty.""


 The old woman paused. ""Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?"" she
 asked abruptly.


 I shook my head. ""Some new kind of ...""


 ""It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active
 rock once found on Mercury. The
Alpha
rays of this rock are similar
 to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles
 projected at high speed. But the character of the
Gamma
rays has
 never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are
 electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of
Beta
or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.


 ""When any form of life is exposed to these
Gamma
rays from the Green
 Flame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude
 and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition
 develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or
 guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of
 intolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,
 a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.""


 I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.


 ""Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three
 planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The
 cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long
 enough to endanger all civilized life.


 ""The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing
 government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had
 ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was
 immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom
 followed.""


 Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.


 ""To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an
 old prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his
 travels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of
 an old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green
 Flames!""


 If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.
 I said, ""So what?""


 ""So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean
 if it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets
 after the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in
 existence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.


 ""Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made
 corking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after
 it was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on
 Earth.""


 ""I see,"" I said as she lapsed into silence. ""And now you've come to the
 conclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is
 attempting to put your plot into action.""


 Grannie nodded. ""Yes,"" she said. ""That's exactly what I think.""


 I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl
 and laughed heartily. ""The same old Flowers,"" I said. ""Tell me, who's
 your thief ... Doctor Universe?""


 She regarded me evenly. ""What makes you say that?""


 I shrugged.


 ""The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.""


 The old woman shook her head. ""No, this is a lot bigger than a simple
 quiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is
 happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,
 police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by
 representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military
 dictator to step in.


 ""And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a
 single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in
 my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand
 times more potent and is transmiting it
en masse
.""


 If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would
 have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of
 approaching danger.


 ""Let's get out of here,"" I said, getting up.
Zinnng-whack!
""All right!""


 On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks
 appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the
 fresco seemed to melt away suddenly.


 A heat ray!


 Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the
 door. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old
 woman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and
 threw over the starting stud.


 An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.
Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last
 outpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as
 the eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick
 water. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray
 sky like puffs of cotton.


 We had traveled this far by
ganet
, the tough little two headed pack
 animal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have
 had its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force
 belt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to
 boatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy
jagua
canoes.


 It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her
 confidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.


 ""We're heading directly for Varsoom country,"" she said. ""If we find
 Ezra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to
 the lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You
 see, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the
 ship.""


 Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours
 tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned
 steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi
 just before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer
 that broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an
 isolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had
 given me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly
 coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that
 representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held
 to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.


 Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my
 tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe
 Grannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots
 which she had skilfully blended into a novel?


 Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its
 place a ringing silence blanketed everything.


 And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in
 undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched
 it advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.
 It charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.
 There was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp
 talons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,
 missing the thing by the narrowest of margins.


 From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress
 appeared. Grannie gave a single warning:


 ""Stand still!""


 The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us
 again. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of
 purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the
 air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the
 ground and shot aloft.
Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.
I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.


 ""In heaven's name, what was it?""


 ""Hunter-bird,"" Grannie said calmly. ""A form of avian life found here
 in the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be
 trained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain
 and follows with a relentless purpose.""


 ""Then that would mean...?""


 ""That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the
 cafe in Swamp City. Exactly."" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her
 tent and faced me with earnest eyes. ""Billy-boy, our every move is
 being watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.""
The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here
 resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding
 ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the
 surface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of
 the swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive
 multi-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.
 The Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his
 hand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in
 a matter of seconds.


 At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one
 of the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude
 jetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.


 He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and
 unkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was
 dressed in
varpa
cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his
 head was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.


 ""Glad to meet you,"" he said, shaking my hand. ""Any friend of Miss
 Flowers is a friend of mine."" He ushered us down the catwalk into his
 hut.


 The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest
 type of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from
 civilization entirely.


 Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the
 object of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.


 ""Green Flames, eh?"" he repeated slowly. ""Well yes, I suppose I could
 find that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.""


 ""What do you mean?"" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a
 cigarette. ""You know where it is, don't you?""


 ""Ye-s,"" Karn nodded. ""But like I told you before, that ship lies in
 Varsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.""


 ""What are the Varsoom?"" I asked. ""A native tribe?""


 Karn shook his head. ""They're a form of life that's never been seen by
 Earthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.""


 ""Dangerous?""


 ""Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside
 of myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away
 because I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped
 because he made 'em laugh.""


 ""Laugh?"" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.


 ""That's right,"" Karn said. ""The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction
 that's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them
 laugh, I don't know.""


 Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.
 Several mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the
 Venusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.


 ""The Doctor Universe program,"" he said. ""I ain't missed one in months.
 You gotta wait 'til I hear it.""


 Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He
 flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a
 chair, listening with avid interest.


 It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I
 heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once
 again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back
 and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi
 screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead
 my thoughts far away.
Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen
 were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We
 camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed
 about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and
 despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the
 futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me
 from turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,
 that all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.


 After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of
 steaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our
 advance on foot.


 It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he
 suddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.
 There it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened
arelium
steel,
 half buried in the swamp soil.


 ""What's that thing on top?"" Karn demanded, puzzled.


 A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern
 quarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And
 suspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white
 insulators.


 Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. ""Billy-boy, take three
 Venusians and head across the knoll,"" she ordered. ""Ezra and I will
 circle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.""


 But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.
 Moments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.


 A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.
 Mid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.


 ""Up we go, Billy-boy."" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to
 climb slowly.


 The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.
 There was no sign of life.


 ""Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,"" Ezra Karn observed.


 Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the
 left side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was
 bare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking
 clarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we
 looked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles
 swing slowly to and fro.


 Grannie nodded. ""Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in
 the lower hold are probably exposed to a
tholpane
plate and their
 radiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.""


 Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the
 glass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.


 ""You'll never do it that way,"" Grannie said. ""Nothing short of an
 atomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no
 guards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the
 Green Flames are more accessible.""


 In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in
 the feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the
 vessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.
 Suspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal
 plate.


 But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.


 Grannie stamped her foot. ""It's maddening,"" she said. ""Here we are at
 the crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single
 move.""

This was the endless problem of all
 
spaceship cooks: He had to feed the men
 
tomorrow on what they had eaten today!
Unable to get out to the ballgame and a long way off from the girls,
 men on ships think about, talk about, bitch about their food. It's
 true that Woman remains a topic of thoughtful study, but discussion
 can never replace practice in an art. Food, on the other hand, is a
 challenge shipmen face three times a day, so central to their thoughts
 that a history of sea-faring can be read from a commissary list.


 In the days when salt-sea sailors were charting islands and spearing
 seals, for example, the fo'c's'le hands called themselves Lobscousers,
 celebrating the liquid hash then prominent in the marine menu. The
 Limey sailor got the name of the anti-scorbutic citrus squeezed into
 his diet, a fruit known to us mariners of a more sophisticated age
 only as garnish for our groundside gin-and-tonic. And today we Marsmen
 are called Slimeheads, honoring in our title the
Chlorella
and
Scenedesmus
algae that, by filling up the spaces within, open the
 road to the larger Space without.


 Should any groundsman dispute the importance of belly-furniture in
 history—whether it be exterminating whales, or introducing syphilis
 to the Fiji Islanders, or settling the Australian littoral with
 cross-coves from Middlesex and Hampshire—he is referred to the
 hundred-and-first chapter of
Moby Dick
, a book spooled in the
 amusement tanks of all but the smallest spacers. I trust, however, that
 no Marsman will undertake to review this inventory of refreshment more
 than a week from groundfall. A catalogue of sides of beef and heads of
 Leyden cheese and ankers of good Geneva would prove heavy reading for a
 man condemned to snack on the Chlorella-spawn of cis-Martian space.


 The
Pequod's
crew ate wormy biscuit and salt beef. Nimitz's men won
 their war on canned pork and beans. The
Triton
made her underwater
 periplus of Earth with a galley stocked with frozen pizza and
 concentrated apple-juice. But then, when sailors left the seas for the
 skies, a decline set in.


 The first amenity of groundside existence to be abandoned was decent
 food. The earliest men into the vacuum swallowed protein squeezings
 from aluminum tubes, and were glad enough to drop back to the
 groundsman's diet of steak and fried potatoes.
Long before I was a boy in Med School, itching to look at black sky
 through a view-port, galley science had fulfilled the disgusting
 exordium of
Isaiah
36:12, to feed the Slimeheads for breakfast today
 what was day-before-yesterday's table-scraps and jakes-water.


 The Ship's Cook, the man who accomplishes the daily miracle of turning
 offal into eatables, is in many ways the most vital man aboard a
 spacer. He can make morale or foment a mutiny. His power is paramount.
 Slimeheads remember the H. M. S.
Ajax
fiasco, for example, in which a
 galleyman leveled his Chlorella tanks with heavy water from the ship's
 shielding. Four officers and twenty-one Other Ranks were rescued from
 the
Ajax
in deep space, half dead from deuterium poisoning. We think
 of the
Benjo Maru
incident, too, caused by a Ship's Cook who allowed
 his algaeal staff-of-life to become contaminated with a fast-growing
Saccharomycodes
yeast. The Japanese vessel staggered to her pad at
 Piano West after a twenty-week drunk: the alien yeast had got into
 the stomach of every man aboard, where it fermented each subsequent
 bite he ate to a superior grade of
sake
. And for a third footnote to
 the ancient observation, ""God sends food, and the Devil sends cooks,""
 Marsmen will recall what happened aboard my ship the
Charles Partlow
 Sale
.


 The
Sale
blasted off from Brady Station in the middle of August, due
 in at Piano West in early May. In no special hurry, we were taking
 the low-energy route to Mars, a pathway about as long in time as the
 human period of gestation. Our cargo consisted mostly of Tien-Shen fir
 seedlings and some tons of an arctic grass-seed—these to be planted
 in the
maria
to squeeze out the native blue bugberry vines. We had
 aboard the Registry minimum of six men and three officers. Ship's
 Surgeon was myself, Paul Vilanova. Our Captain was Willy Winkelmann,
 the hardest man in space and very likely the fattest. Ship's Cook was
 Robert Bailey.


 Cooking aboard a spacer is a job combining the more frustrating
 tensions of biochemistry, applied mycology, high-speed farming,
 dietetics and sewage engineering. It's the Cook's responsibility to
 see that each man aboard gets each day no less than five pounds of
 water, two pounds of oxygen, and one-and-a-half pounds of dry food.
 This isn't just a paragraph from the Spacer Union Contract. It's a
 statement of the least fuel a man can run on.


 Twelve tons of water, oxygen, and food would have filled the cargo
 compartments to bursting, and left a small ship like the
C. P. Sale
no reason to reach for Mars. By allowing a colony of Chlorella algae to
 work over our used air, water and other effluvia, though, three tons
 of metabolites would see us through from Brady Station to Piano West
 and back. Recycling was the answer. The molecule of carbohydrate, fat,
 protein or mineral that didn't feed the crew fed the algae. And the
 algae fed us.


 All waste was used to fertilize our liquid fields. Even the stubble
 from our 2,680 shaves and the clippings from our 666 haircuts en route
 and back would be fed into the Chlorella tanks. Human hair is rich in
 essential amino acids.


 The algae—dried by the Cook, bleached with methyl alcohol to kill the
 smell and make the residue more digestible, disguised and seasoned in a
 hundred ways—served as a sort of meat-and-potatoes that never quite
 wore out. Our air and water were equally immortal. Each molecule of
 oxygen would be conversant with the alveoli of every man aboard by the
 end of our trip. Every drop of water would have been intimate with the
 glomeruli of each kidney on the ship before we grounded in. Groundling
 politicians are right enough when they say that we spacers are a
 breed apart. We're the one race of men who can't afford the luxury of
 squeamishness.
Though I'm signed aboard as Ship's Surgeon, I seldom lift a knife
 in space. My employment is more in the nature of TS-card-puncher
 extraordinary. My duties are to serve as wailing-wall, morale officer,
 guardian of the medicinal whiskey and frustrator of mutual murder.
 Generally the man aboard who'd serve as the most popular murder-victim
 is the Cook. This trip, the-man-you-love-to-hate was our Captain.


 If the Cook hadn't problems enough with the chemical and psychic duties
 of his office, Winkelmann supplied the want. Captain Willy Winkelmann
 was the sort of man who, if he had to go into space at all, had best do
 so alone. If the Prussians had a Marine Corps, Winkelmann would have
 done splendidly as Drill Instructor for their boot camp. His heart
 was a chip of helium ice, his voice dripped sarcastic acid. The planet
 Earth was hardly large enough to accommodate a wart as annoying as
 Willy Winkelmann. Cheek-by-jowl every day in a nacelle the size of a
 Pullman car, our Captain quickly established himself as a major social
 hemorrhoid.


 The Captain's particular patsy was, of course, young Bailey the Cook.
 It was Winkelmann who saw humorous possibilities in the entry, ""Bailey,
 Robert,"" on Ship's Articles. He at once renamed our unfortunate
 shipmate ""Belly-Robber."" It was Winkelmann who discussed
haut
 cuisine
and the properties of the nobler wines while we munched our
 algaeburgers and sipped coffee that tasted of utility water. And it was
 Captain Willy Winkelmann who never referred to the ship's head by any
 other name than The Kitchen Cabinet.


 Bailey tried to feed us by groundside standards. He hid the taste
 of synthetic methionine—an essential amino acid not synthesized by
 Chlorella—by seasoning our algaeal repasts with pinches of oregano
 and thyme. He tinted the pale-green dollops of pressed Chlorella pink,
 textured the mass to the consistency of hamburger and toasted the
 slabs to a delicate brown in a forlorn attempt to make mock-meat.
 For dessert, he served a fudge compounded from the dextrose-paste of
 the carbohydrate recycler. The crew thanked him. The Captain did not.
 ""Belly-Robber,"" he said, his tone icy as winter wind off the North Sea,
 ""you had best cycle this mess through the tanks again. There is a pun
 in my home country:
Mensch ist was er isst.
It means, you are what
 you eat. I think you are impertinent to suggest I should become this
Schweinerei
you are feeding me."" Captain Winkelmann blotted his chin
 with his napkin, heaved his bulk up from the table, and climbed up the
 ladder from the dining-cubby.
""Doc, do you like Winkelmann?"" the Cook asked me.


 ""Not much,"" I said. ""I suspect that the finest gift our Captain can
 give his mother is to be absent from her on Mother's Day. But we've got
 to live with him. He's a good man at driving a ship.""


 ""I wish he'd leave off driving this Cook,"" Bailey said. ""The fat swine!""


 ""His plumpness is an unwitting tribute to your cooking, Bailey,"" I
 said. ""He eats well. We all do. I've dined aboard a lot of spacers in
 my time, and I'll testify that you set a table second to none.""


 Bailey took a handful of dried Chlorella from a bin and fingered it. It
 was green, smelled of swamp, and looked appetizing as a bedsore. ""This
 is what I have to work with,"" he said. He tossed the stuff back into
 its bin. ""In Ohio, which is my home country, in the presence of ladies,
 we'd call such garbage Horse-Leavings.""


 ""You'll never make Winkelmann happy,"" I said. ""Even the simultaneous
 death of all other human beings could hardly make him smile. Keep up
 the good work, though, and you'll keep our Captain fat.""


 Bailey nodded from his one-man cloud of gloom. I got a bottle of rye
 from Medical Stores and offered him a therapeutic draught. The Cook
 waved my gift aside. ""Not now, Doc,"" he said. ""I'm thinking about
 tomorrow's menu.""


 The product of Bailey's cerebrations was on the mess table at noon the
 next day. We were each served an individual head of lettuce, dressed
 with something very like vinegar and oil, spiced with tiny leaves of
 burnet. How Bailey had constructed those synthetic lettuces I can only
 guess: the hours spent preparing a green Chlorella paste, rolling and
 drying and shaping each artificial leaf, the fitting together of nine
 heads like crisp, three-dimensional jigsaw puzzles. The
pièce de
 résistance
was again a ""hamburger steak;"" but this time the algaeal
 mass that made it up was buried in a rich, meaty gravy that was only
 faintly green. The essence-of-steak used in these Chlorella cutlets had
 been sprinkled with a lavish hand. Garlic was richly in evidence. ""It's
 so tender,"" the radioman joked, ""that I can hardly believe it's really
 steak.""


 Bailey stared across the dining-cubby toward Winkelmann, silently
 imploring the Captain's ratification of his masterpiece. The big
 man's pink cheeks bulged and jumped with his chewing. He swallowed.
 ""Belly-Robber,"" Winkelmann said, ""I had almost rather you served me
 this pond-scum raw than have it all mucked-up with synthetic onions and
 cycler-salt.""
""You seem able enough to choke down Bailey's chow, Captain,"" I said. I
 gazed at Winkelmann's form, bulbous from a lifetime of surfeit feeding.


 ""Yes, I eat it,"" the Captain said, taking and talking through another
 bite. ""But I eat only as a man in the desert will eat worms and
 grasshoppers, to stay alive.""


 ""Sir, what in heaven's name do you expect from me?"" Bailey pleaded.


 ""Only good food,"" Winkelmann mumbled through his mouthful of disguised
 algae. He tapped his head with a finger. ""This—the brain that guides
 the ship—cannot be coaxed to work on hog-slop. You understand me,
 Belly-Robber?""


 Bailey, his hands fisted at his sides, nodded. ""Yes, sir. But I really
 don't know what I can do to please you.""


 ""You are a spacer and a Ship's Cook, not a suburban
Hausfrau
with the
 vapors,"" Winkelmann said. ""I do not expect from you hysterics, tantrums
 or weeping. Only—can you understand this, so simple?—food that will
 keep my belly content and my brain alive.""


 ""Yes, sir,"" Bailey said, his face a picture of that offense the British
 term Dumb Insolence.


 Winkelmann got up and climbed the ladder to the pilot-cubicle. I
 followed him. ""Captain,"" I said, ""you're driving Bailey too hard.
 You're asking him to make bricks without straw.""


 Winkelmann regarded me with his pale-blue stare. ""You think, Doctor,
 that my cruelty to the Belly-Robber is the biliousness of a middle-aged
 man?""


 ""Frankly, I can't understand your attitude at all,"" I said.


 ""You accuse me of driving a man to make bricks without straw,""
 Winkelmann said. ""Very well, Doctor. It is my belief that if the
 Pharaoh's taskmaster had had my firmness of purpose, the Children of
 Israel would have made bricks with stubble. Necessity, Doctor, is the
 mother of invention. I am Bailey's necessity. My unkindnesses make him
 uncomfortable, I doubt that not. But I am forcing him to experiment,
 to improvise, to widen the horizons of his ingenuity. He will learn
 somehow to bring good food from Chlorella tanks.""


 ""You're driving him too hard, Sir,"" I said. ""He'll crack.""


 ""Bailey will have some fifty thousand dollars' salary waiting when we
 ground at Brady Station,"" Captain Winkelmann said. ""So much money buys
 many discomforts. That will be all, Doctor Vilanova.""


 ""Crew morale on the ship...."" I began.


 ""That will be all, Doctor Vilanova,"" Captain Winkelmann repeated.
Bailey grew more silent as we threaded our way along the elliptical
 path to Mars. Each meal he prepared was a fresh attempt to propitiate
 the appetite of our splenetic Captain. Each such offering was condemned
 by that heartless man. Bailey began to try avoiding the Captain at
 mealtimes, but was frustrated by Winkelmann's orders. ""Convey my
 compliments to the Chef, please,"" the Captain would instruct one of
 the crew, ""and ask him to step down here a moment."" And the Cook would
 cheerlessly appear in the dining-cubby, to have his culinary genius
 acidly called in question again.


 I myself do not doubt that Bailey was the finest Cook ever to go
 into Hohmann orbit. His every meal established a higher benchmark in
 brilliant galleymanship. We were served, for instance, an
ersatz
hot
 turkey supreme. The cheese-sauce was almost believable, the Chlorella
 turkey-flesh was white and tender. Bailey served with this delicacy
 a grainy and delicious ""cornbread,"" and had extracted from his algae
 a lipid butter-substitute that soaked into the hot ""bread"" with a
 genuinely dairy smell. ""Splendid, Bailey,"" I said.


 ""We are not amused,"" said Captain Winkelmann, accepting a second
 helping of the pseudo-turkey. ""You are improving, Belly-Robber, but
 only arithmetically. Your first efforts were so hideous as to require
 a geometric progression of improving excellence to raise them to mere
 edibility. By the time we are halfway 'round the Sun, I trust you will
 have learned to cook with the competence of a freshman Home Economics
 student. That will be all, Bailey.""


 The crew and my fellow-officers were amused by Winkelmann's riding of
 Bailey; they were in addition gratified that the battle between their
 Captain and their Cook served to feed them so well. Most spacers embark
 on an outward voyage somewhat plump, having eaten enough on their last
 few days aground to smuggle several hundred calories of fat and many
 memories of good food aboard with them. This trip, none of the men had
 lost weight during the first four months in space. Winkelmann, indeed,
 seemed to have gained. His uniform was taut over his plump backside,
 and he puffed a bit up the ladders. I was considering suggesting to our
 Captain that he curtail his diet for reasons of health, a bit of advice
 that would have stood unique in the annals of space medicine, when
 Winkelmann produced his supreme insult to our Cook.
Each man aboard a spacer is allowed ten kilograms of personal effects
 besides his uniforms, these being considered Ship's Furnishing. As
 his rank and responsibility merit, the Captain is allowed double this
 ration. He may thus bring aboard with him some forty-five pounds of
 books, playing-cards, knitting-wool, whiskey or what have you to help
 him while away the hours between the planets. Bailey, I knew for a
 fact, had used up his weight-allowance in bringing aboard a case of
 spices: marjoram and mint, costmary, file powder, basil and allspice,
 and a dozen others.


 Captain Winkelmann was not a reader, and had brought no books. Cards
 interested him not at all, as card-playing implies a sociability alien
 to his nature. He never drank aboard ship. I had supposed that he'd
 exercised his option of returning his personal-effects weight allowance
 to the owners for the consideration of one hundred dollars a kilogram.
 To collect the maximum allowance, spacers have been known to come
 aboard their ship mother-naked.


 But this was not the case with Winkelmann. His personal-effects
 baggage, an unlabeled cardboard box, appeared under the table at noon
 mess some hundred days out from Piano West. Winkelmann rested his feet
 on the mysterious box as he sat to eat.


 ""What disgusting form does the ship's garbage appear in today,
 Belly-Robber?"" he asked the Cook.


 Bailey frowned, but kept his temper, an asceticism in which by now he'd
 had much practice. ""I've been working on the problem of steak, Sir,""
 he said. ""I think I've whipped the taste; what was left was to get the
 texture steak-like. Do you understand, Sir?""


 ""I understand,"" Winkelmann growled. ""You intend that your latest mess
 should feel like steak to the mouth, and not like baby-food. Right?""


 ""Yes, Sir,"" Bailey said. ""Well, I squeezed the
 steak-substrate—Chlorella, of course, with all sorts of special
 seasonings—through a sieve, and blanched the strands in hot algaeal
 oil. Then I chopped those strands to bits and rolled them out.
Voila!
I had something very close in texture to the muscle-fibers of genuine
 meat.""


 ""Remarkable, Bailey,"" I said.


 ""It rather throws me off my appetite to hear how you muddle about with
 our food,"" the Captain said, his jowls settling into an expression of
 distaste. ""It's quite all right to eat lobster, for example, but I
 never cared to see the ugly beast boiled before my eyes. Detail spoils
 the meal.""


 Bailey lifted the cover off the electric warming-pan at the center of
 the table and tenderly lifted a small ""steak"" onto each of our plates.
 ""Try it,"" he urged the Captain.
Captain Winkelmann sliced off a corner of his algaeal steak. The
 color was an excellent medium-rare, the odor was the rich smell
 of fresh-broiled beef. Winkelmann bit down, chewed, swallowed. ""Not
 too bad, Belly-Robber,"" he said, nodding. Bailey grinned and bobbed
 his head, his hands folded before him in an ecstasy of pleasure. A
 kind word from the Captain bettered the ruffles-and-flourishes of a
 more reasonable man. ""But it still needs something ... something,""
 Winkelmann went on, slicing off another portion of the tasty Chlorella.
 ""Aha! I have it!""


 ""Yes, Sir?"" Bailey asked.


 ""This, Belly-Robber!"" Winkelmann reached beneath the mess-table and
 ripped open his cardboard carton. He brought out a bottle and unscrewed
 the cap. ""Ketchup,"" he said, splattering the red juice over Bailey's
 masterpiece. ""The scarlet burial-shroud for the failures of Cooks.""
 Lifting a hunk of the ""steak,"" streaming ketchup, to his mouth,
 Winkelmann chewed. ""Just the thing,"" he smiled.


 ""Damn you!"" Bailey shouted.


 Winkelmann's smile flicked off, and his blue eyes pierced the Cook.


 ""... Sir,"" Bailey added.


 ""That's better,"" Winkelmann said, and took another bite. He said
 meditatively, ""Used with caution, and only by myself, I believe I have
 sufficient ketchup here to see me through to Mars. Please keep a
 bottle on the table for all my future meals, Belly-Robber.""


 ""But, Sir...."" Bailey began.


 ""You must realize, Belly-Robber, that a dyspeptic Captain is a threat
 to the welfare of his ship. Were I to continue eating your surrealistic
 slops for another hundred days, without the small consolation of
 this sauce I had the foresight to bring with me, I'd likely be in
 no condition to jet us safely down to the Piano West pad. Do you
 understand, Belly-Robber?"" he demanded.


 ""I understand that you're an ungrateful, impossible, square-headed,
 slave-driving....""


 ""Watch your noun,"" Winkelmann cautioned the Cook. ""Your adjectives are
 insubordinate; your noun might prove mutinous.""


 ""Captain, you've gone too far,"" I said. Bailey, his fists knotted, was
 scarlet, his chest heaving with emotion.


 ""Doctor, I must point out to you that it ill behooves the Ship's
 Surgeon to side with the Cook against the Captain,"" Winkelmann said.


 ""Sir, Bailey has tried hard to please you,"" I said. ""The other officers
 and the men have been more than satisfied with his work.""


 ""That only suggests atrophy of their taste buds,"" Winkelmann said.
 ""Doctor, you are excused. As are you, Belly-Robber,"" he added.
Bailey and I climbed from the mess compartment together. I steered him
 to my quarters, where the medical supplies were stored. He sat on my
 bunk and exploded into weeping, banging his fists against the metal
 bulkhead. ""You'll have that drink now,"" I said.


 ""No, dammit!"" he shouted.


 ""Orders,"" I said. I poured us each some fifty cc's of rye. ""This is
 therapy, Bailey,"" I told him. He poured the fiery stuff down his throat
 like water and silently held out his glass for a second. I provided it.


 After a few minutes Bailey's sobbing ceased. ""Sorry, Doc,"" he said.


 ""You've taken more pressure than most men would,"" I said. ""Nothing to
 be ashamed of.""


 ""He's crazy. What sane man would expect me to dip Wiener schnitzel
 and sauerkraut and
Backhahndl nach suddeutscher Art
out of an algae
 tank? I've got nothing but microscopic weeds to cook for him! Worn-out
 molecules reclaimed from the head; packaged amino acid additives. And
 he expects meals that would take the blue ribbon at the annual banquet
 of the Friends of Escoffier!""


 ""Yours is an ancient plaint, Bailey,"" I said. ""You've worked your
 fingers to the bone, slaving over a hot stove, and you're not
 appreciated. But you're not married to Winkelmann, remember. A year
 from now you'll be home in Ohio, fifty grand richer, set to start that
 restaurant of yours and forget about our fat Flying Dutchman.""


 ""I hate him,"" Bailey said with the simplicity of true emotion. He
 reached for the bottle. I let him have it. Sometimes alcohol can be
 an apt confederate of
vis medicatrix naturae
, the healing power of
 nature. Half an hour later I strapped Bailey into his bunk to sleep it
 off. That therapeutic drunk seemed to be just what he'd needed.


 For morning mess the next day we had a broth remarkable in
 horribleness, a pottage or boiled
Chlorella vulgaris
that looked
 and tasted like the vomit of some bottom-feeding sea-beast. Bailey,
 red-eyed and a-tremble, made no apology, and stared at Winkelmann as
 though daring him to comment. The Captain lifted a spoonful of the
 disgusting stuff to his lips, smacked and said, ""Belly-Robber, you're
 improving a little at last.""


 Bailey nodded and smiled. ""Thank you, Sir,"" he said.


 I smiled, too. Bailey had conquered himself. His psychic defenses were
 now strong enough to withstand the Captain's fiercest assaults of
 irony. Our food would likely be bad the rest of this trip, but that was
 a price I was willing to pay for seeing destroyed the Willy Winkelmann
 theory of forcing a Cook to make bricks without straw. The Captain
 had pushed too hard. He'd need that ketchup for the meals to come, I
 thought.


 Noon mess was nearly as awful as breakfast had been. The coffee tasted
 of salt, and went largely undrunk. The men in the mess compartment were
 vehement in their protests, blaming the Captain, in his absence, for
 the decline in culinary standards. Bailey seemed not to care. He served
 the algaeburgers with half a mind, and hurried back into his galley
 oblivious of the taunts of his crewmates.
There being only three seats in the
Sale's
mess compartment, we ate
 our meals in three shifts. That evening, going down the ladder to
 supper, my nose was met with a spine-tingling barbecue tang, a smell
 to make a man think of gray charcoal glowing in a picnic brazier,
 of cicadas chirping and green grass underfoot, of the pop and hiss
 of canned beer being church-keyed. ""He's done it, Doc!"" one of the
 first-shift diners said. ""It actually tastes of food!""


 ""Then he's beat the Captain at his game,"" I said.


 ""The Dutchman won't want to mess ketchup on these steaks,"" the crewman
 said.


 I sat, unfolded my napkin, and looked with hope to the electric
 warming-pan at the center of the table. Bailey served the three of
 us with the small ""steaks."" Each contained about a pound of dried
 Chlorella, I judged, teasing mine with my fork. But they were drenched
 in a gravy rich as the stuff grandma used to make in her black iron
 skillet, peppery and seasoned with courageous bits of garlic. I cut
 a bit from my steak and chewed it. Too tender, of course; there are
 limits to art. But the pond-scum taste was gone. Bailey appeared in the
 galley door. I gestured for him to join me. ""You've done it, Bailey,""
 I said. ""Every Slimehead in orbit will thank you for this. This is
 actually
good
.""


 ""Thanks, Doc,"" Bailey said.


 I smiled and took another bite. ""You may not realize it, Bailey; but
 this is a victory for the Captain, too. He drove you to this triumph;
 you couldn't have done it without him.""


 ""You mean he was just whipping me on, trying to make me do better?""
 Bailey asked.


 ""He was driving you to do the impossible,"" I said; ""and you did it. Our
 Captain may be a hard man, Bailey; but he did know how to coax maximum
 performance out of his Ship's Cook.""


 Bailey stood up. ""Do you like Captain Winkelmann, Doctor?"" he asked.


 I thought about his question a moment. Winkelmann was good at his job.
 He persuaded his men by foul means, true; but it was all for the good
 of the ship and his crew. ""Do I like Captain Winkelmann?"" I asked,
 spearing another piece of my artificial steak. ""Bailey, I'm afraid I'll
 have to admit that I do.""


 Bailey smiled and lifted a second steak from the warming-pan onto my
 plate. ""Then have another piece,"" he said.

When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course
 
a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that
 
he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!
The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did
 the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in
 the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.


 Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the
 humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and
 arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior
 to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was
 accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was
 almost ordinary-looking.


 As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely
 amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably
 hideous.


 Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a
 short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were
 in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though
 not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic
 surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.


 The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his
 clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather
 ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt
 he was, which was what mattered.


 ""Sorry, colleague,"" Gabe said lazily. ""All my fault. You must let me
 buy you a replacement."" He gestured to the bartender. ""Another of the
 same for my fellow-man here.""


 The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth
 hastily supplied by the management.


 ""You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,"" Gabe said, taking out
 his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look
 at them. ""Here, have yourself a new suit on me.""
You could use one
was implied.


 And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,
 was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just
 set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's
 handsome face.
Suddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. ""Don't do that,"" the
 nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed
 the glass from the little man's slackening grasp. ""You wouldn't want to
 go to jail because of him.""


 The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces
 now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too
 strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to
 smash back, and now it was too late for that.


 Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. ""So, it's you again?""


 The man in the gray suit smiled. ""Who else in any world would stand up
 for you?""


 ""I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you
 around, of course,"" Gabriel added too quickly. ""You do come in useful
 at times, you know.""


 ""So you don't mind having me around?"" The nondescript man smiled again.
 ""Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from
 yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?""


 Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. ""Come on, have a drink
 with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you
 something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.""


 ""I drank with you once too often,"" the nondescript man said. ""And
 things worked out fine, didn't they? For you."" His eyes studied the
 other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of
 bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were
 not pleased with what they saw. ""Watch yourself, colleague,"" he warned
 as he left. ""Soon you might not be worth the saving.""


 ""Who was that, Gabe?"" the girl asked.


 He shrugged. ""I never saw him before in my life."" Of course, knowing
 him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he
 happened to have been telling the truth.
Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel
 suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as
 he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again
 that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a
 coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,
 reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to
 the letter combination
bodyguard
, he went out into the street.


 If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have
 been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real
 identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for
 years.


 The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. ""Where to, fellow-man?""
 the driver asked.


 ""I'm new in the parish,"" the other man replied and let it hang there.


 ""Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?""


 But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.


 ""Games?"" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was
 wanted by then. ""Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?""


 ""Is there a good zarquil game in town?""


 The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the
 teleview. A very ordinary face. ""Look, colleague, why don't you commit
 suicide? It's cleaner and quicker.""


 ""I can't contact your attitude,"" the passenger said with a thin
 smile. ""Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it
 happens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a
 thrill-mill."" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and
 which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.


 ""Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?"" The driver spat out of the
 window. ""If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the
 cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...
 anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.""


 ""But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a
 commission, wouldn't it?"" the other man asked coolly.


 ""Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.""


 ""I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.""


 ""You're the dictator,"" the driver agreed sullenly.
II


 It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no
 condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.


 ""Let me take the controls, honey,"" the light-haired girl urged, but he
 shook his handsome head.


 ""Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,"" he said thickly,
 referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,
 and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.


 Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that
 when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little
 town, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed
 on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a
 short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.


 To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto
 the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the
 young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there
 at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to
 remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment
 before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.


 Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him
 speculatively. ""My guardian angel,"" he mumbled—shock had sobered him
 a little, but not enough. He sat up. ""Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have
 thrown me back in.""


 ""And that's no joke,"" the fat man agreed.


 The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall
 that he had not been alone. ""How about Helen? She on course?""


 ""Seems to be,"" the fat man said. ""You all right, miss?"" he asked,
 glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.


 ""
Mrs.
,"" Gabriel corrected. ""Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel
 Lockard,"" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.
 ""Pretty bauble, isn't she?""


 ""I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,"" the fat man said,
 looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up
 from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. ""I hope
 you'll be worthy of the name."" The light given off by the flaming
 car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.
 Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.


 There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the
 lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the
 newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and
 beginning to slide downhill....


 Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.
There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,
 which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and
 his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket
 closer about her chilly body. ""Aren't you going to introduce your—your
 friend to me, Gabe?""


 ""I don't know who he is,"" Gabe said almost merrily, ""except that he's
 no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?""


 ""Of course I have a name."" The fat man extracted an identification
 card from his wallet and read it. ""Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and
 Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail
 milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks
 ago, and now he isn't ... anything.""


 ""You saved our lives,"" the girl said. ""I'd like to give you some token
 of my—of our appreciation."" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier
 with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only
 casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation
 held little gratitude.


 The fat man shook his head without rancor. ""I have plenty of money,
 thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,"" he addressed her husband,
 ""if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the
 future! Sometimes,"" he added musingly, ""I almost wish you would let
 something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?""


 Gabriel shivered. ""I'll be careful,"" he vowed. ""I promise—I'll be
 careful.""
When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,
 the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi
 driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the
 commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others
 had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate
 or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known
 colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from
 one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you
 could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it
 extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.
 Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care.


 Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were
 many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word
 implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so
 deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of
 ""crimes against nature."" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to
 zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly
 applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as
 nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;
 otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.
Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it
 profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's
 seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien
 human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with
 interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many
 slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them
 zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.
 Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been
 big money in musical chairs as such.


 When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as
 they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the
 law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court
 could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life
 spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital
 punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the
 terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons
 could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired
 after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because
 trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between
 Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance
 of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.


 The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in
 which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to
 conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.
 But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence
 of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive
 light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was
 the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting
 involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.


 The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,
 when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into
 darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to
 have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew
 everybody else far too well.


 The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in
 coming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually
 disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed
 too logical for the man he was haunting.


 However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the
 heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. ""One?"" the small green
 creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.


 ""One,"" the fat man answered.
III


 The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays
 from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile
 patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular
 features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine
 Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. ""Only
 weighted out,"" he muttered, ""he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you
 two to come out to a place like this?""


 ""I really think Gabriel
must
be possessed...."" the girl said, mostly
 to herself. ""I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be
 until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.
 It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?""


 ""It does indeed,"" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was
 growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect
 them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable
 and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.


 The girl looked closely at him. ""You look different, but you
are
the
 same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before
 that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?""


 The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. ""Yes, I'm all of
 them.""


 ""Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people
 who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?"" Automatically she
 reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale
 hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not
 been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.
He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.


 ""But why do you do it?
Why!
Do you like it? Or is it because of
 Gabriel?"" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here
 and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was
 included in its scope. ""Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;
 is that it?""


 ""Ask him.""


 ""He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I
 didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what
 we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I
 think?""


 There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she
 wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or
 third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it
 respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she
 must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking
 for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,
 she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so
 casually.
It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her
 husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from
 some animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about
 herself. The thin young man began to cough again.


 Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk
 of the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships
 embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow
 she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a
 barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who
 followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of
 them would stay....


 ""If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,"" she asked, ""why then
 do you keep helping him?""


 ""I am not helping
him
. And he knows that.""


 ""You'll change again tonight, won't you?"" she babbled. ""You always
 change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to
 identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's
 something about you that doesn't change.""


 ""Too bad he got married,"" the young man said. ""I could have followed
 him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out
 from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,"" he added, his voice
 less impersonal, ""for your sake.""


 She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but
 she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an
 outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had
 known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect
 that he was even more closely involved than that.


 ""Why must you change again?"" she persisted, obliquely approaching the
 subject she feared. ""You have a pretty good body there. Why run the
 risk of getting a bad one?""


 ""This isn't a good body,"" he said. ""It's diseased. Sure, nobody's
 supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical
 examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading
 me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty
 of foliage.""


 ""How—long will it last you?""


 ""Four or five months, if I'm careful."" He smiled. ""But don't worry, if
 that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be
 expensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then
 it was tough on me too, wasn't it?""


 ""But how did you get into this ... pursuit?"" she asked again. ""And why
 are you doing it?"" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard
 for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should
 know him better than most.


 ""Ask your husband.""


 The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,
 snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,
 and stirred it with his toe. ""I'd better call a cab—he might freeze to
 death.""


 He signaled and a cab came.


 ""Tell him, when he comes to,"" he said to the girl as he and the driver
 lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, ""that I'm
 getting pretty tired of this."" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.
 ""Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,
 in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.""
""Sorry,"" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect
 except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, ""but I'm afraid you
 cannot play.""


 ""Why not?"" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.


 ""You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.""


 ""But I have plenty of money."" The young man coughed. The Vinzz
 shrugged. ""I'll pay you twice the regular fee.""


 The green one shook his head. ""Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This
 game is really clean.""


 ""In a town like this?""


 ""That is the reason we can afford to be honest."" The Vinzz' tendrils
 quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through
 long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His
 heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been
 velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung
 with him.


 ""We do a lot of business here,"" he said unnecessarily, for the whole
 set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by
 no means poor when it came to worldly goods. ""Why don't you try another
 town where they're not so particular?""


 The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.
 He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.
 And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he
 wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was
 he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own
 discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact
 that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?
 Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the
 hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day
 win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original
 casing had?


 He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he
 would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl,
 seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened
 and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that
 the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand
 how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of
 information.
The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they
 detached, and the first approached the man once more. ""There is, as it
 happens, a body available for a private game,"" he lisped. ""No questions
 to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good
 health.""


 The man hesitated. ""But unable to pass the screening?"" he murmured
 aloud. ""A criminal then.""


 The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.


 ""Male?""


 ""Of course,"" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate
 standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the
 curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it
 kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had
 also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials
 exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or
 biological impossibility, no one could tell.


 It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever
 been proved that an alien life-form had ""desecrated"" a human body,
 Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held
 its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite
 being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had
 been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on
 Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,
 ""Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.""


 ""It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take
 such a risk."" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""How much?""


 ""Thirty thousand credits.""


 ""Why, that's three times the usual rate!""


 ""The other will pay five times the usual rate.""


 ""Oh, all right,"" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific
 risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he
 himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all
 the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.
He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;
 tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to
 match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many
 people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the
 pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it
 was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful
 student of the ""wanted"" fax that had decorated public buildings from
 time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he
 might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of
 the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though
 not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the
 police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital
 punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the
 man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,
 nor whom the police intended to capture easily.
This might be a lucky break for me after all
, the new tenant thought,
 as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious
 rude health, was not a very comfortable fit.
I can do a lot with a
 hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe
 I'll be able to get away with it.

 ""Look, Gabe,"" the girl said, ""don't try to fool me! I know you
 too well. And I know you have that man's—the real Gabriel
 Lockard's—body."" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she
 watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.


 Lockard—Lockard's body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven
 chin. ""That what he tell you?""


 ""No, he didn't tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you
 whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he
 obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to
 see his body spoiled.""


 ""It
is
a pretty good body, isn't it?"" Gabe flexed softening muscles
 and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved
 at having someone with whom to share his secret.


 ""Not as good as it must have been,"" the girl said, turning and looking
 at him without admiration. ""Not if you keep on the way you're coursing.
 Gabe, why don't you...?""


 ""Give it back to him, eh?"" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.
 ""You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be
his
wife then. That would be
 nice—a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little
 more than you deserve?""


 ""I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,"" she said truthfully enough, for
 she hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. ""Of course I'd
 go with you,"" she went on, now knowing she lied, ""when you got your ...
 old body back.""
Sure
, she thought,
I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and
 thrill-mills.
Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only
 once, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go
 with him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash
 that experience from her mind or her body.


 ""You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?""
 she went on. ""You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose,
 does he?""


 ""I don't want to know!"" he spat. ""I wouldn't want it if I could get
 it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he
 looked in a mirror."" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.
 ""Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a
 hulk I had!""


 ""Oh, yes, I can,"" she said incautiously. ""You must have had a body to
 match your character. Pity you could only change one.""

The high costs of low language. 

         Sunday, Jan. 14, 1996: A day that will live in--well, not infamy, exactly. Blasphemy would be closer to it. 

         Early that afternoon, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the American Football Conference championship. Linebacker Greg Lloyd, accepting the trophy in front of a national television audience, responded with enthusiasm. ""Let's see if we can bring this damn thing back here next year,"" he said, ""along with the [expletive] Super Bowl."" 

         A few hours later, Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defense of his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference title: ""Nobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer. He took all of this [expletive] ."" 

         Iwatched those episodes, and, incongruous as it may sound, I thought of Kenneth Tynan. Britain's great postwar drama critic was no fan of American football, but he was a fan of swearing. Thirty years earlier, almost to the week, Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity as literary director of Britain's National Theater and asked if he would allow the theater to present a play in which sex took place on stage. ""Certainly,"" he replied. ""I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom the word '[expletive]' is particularly diabolical or revolting or totally forbidden."" 

         It turned out there were a few more than Tynan thought. Within 24 hours, resolutions had been introduced in the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenity, for his removal as a theater official, and for censure of the network for allowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves. Tynan escaped punishment, but he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for the rest his life. To much of ordinary Britain, he became the man who had said ""[expletive]"" on the BBC. 

         Neither Greg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized. ""It's live television,"" NBC Vice President Ed Markey said, rationalizing the outbursts. ""It's an emotional moment. These things happen."" Irvin wasn't about to let that stand. ""I knew exactly what I was saying,"" he insisted later. ""Those of you who can't believe I said it--believe it."" 

         Swearing isn't the only public act that Western civilization condones today but didn't 30 years ago. But it is one of the most interesting. It is everywhere, impossible to avoid or tune out. 

           

          

            I am sitting in a meeting at the office, talking with a colleague about a business circumstance that may possibly go against us. ""In that case, we're [expletive] ,"" he says. Five years ago, he would have said ""screwed."" Twenty years ago, he would have said, ""We're in big trouble."" Societal tolerance of profanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on.   

             

            I am walking along a suburban street, trailing a class of pre-schoolers who are linked to each other by a rope. A pair of teen-agers passes us in the other direction. By the time they have reached the end of the line of children, they have tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I was well into adolescence, let alone use in casual conversation on a public street.   

             

            I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about a foundation grant. I tell her something she wasn't aware of before. In 1965, the appropriate response was ""no kidding."" In 1996, you do not say ""no kidding."" It is limp and ineffectual. If you are surprised at all, you say what she says: ""No shit."" 

          

         What word is taboo in middle-class America in 1996? There are a couple of credible candidates: The four-letter word for ""vagina"" remains off-limits in polite conversation (although that has more to do with feminism than with profanity), and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sex with males is not yet acceptable by the standards of office-meeting etiquette. 

         But aside from a few exceptions, the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost to nothing as the 20th century comes to an end; the currency of swearing has been inflated to the brink of worthlessness. When almost anything can be said in public, profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all. 

         That most of the forbidden words of the 1950s are no longer forbidden will come as news to nobody: The steady debasement of the common language is only one of many social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to the current. What is important is that profanity served a variety of purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes any more. 

         What purposes? There are a couple of plausible answers. One of them is emotional release. Robert Graves, who wrote a book in the 1920s called The Future of Swearing , thought that profanity was the adult replacement for childhood tears. There comes a point in life, he wrote, when ""wailing is rightly discouraged, and groans are also considered a signal of extreme weakness. Silence under suffering is usually impossible."" So one reaches back for a word one does not normally use, and utters it without undue embarrassment or guilt. And one feels better--even stimulated. 

         The anthropologist Ashley Montagu, whose Anatomy of Swearing , published in 1967, is the definitive modern take on the subject, saw profanity as a safety valve rather than a stimulant, a verbal substitute for physical aggression. When someone swears, Montagu wrote, ""potentially noxious energy is converted into a form that renders it comparatively innocuous."" 

         One could point out, in arguing against the safety-valve theory, that as America has grown more profane in the past 30 years, it has also grown more violent, not less. But this is too simple. It isn't just the supply of dirty words that matters, it's their emotive power. If they have lost that power through overuse, it's perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deter aggressive behavior has weakened as well. 

         But there is something else important to say about swearing--that it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considers powerful, awesome, and a little scary. 

         I'm not sure there is an easy way to convey to anybody under 30, for example, the sheer emotive force that the word ""[expletive]"" possessed in the urban childhood culture of 40 years ago. It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood but that was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world. It was the embodiment of both pleasure and danger. It was not a word or an idea to mess with. When it was used, it was used, as Ashley Montagu said, ""sotto voce , like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbidden frontier."" 

         In that culture, the word ""[expletive]"" was not only obscene, it was profane, in the original sense: It took an important idea in vain. Profanity can be an act of religious defiance, but it doesn't have to be. The Greeks tempted fate by invoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus; they also swore upon everyday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understand. ""By the Cabbage!"" Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress, and that was for good reason. He believed that cabbage cured hangovers, and as such, carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with the requisite emotional charge. 

         These days, none of us believes in cabbage in the way Socrates did, or in the gods in the way most Athenians did. Most Americans tell poll-takers that they believe in God, but few of them in a way that would make it impossible to take His name in vain: That requires an Old Testament piety that disappeared from American middle-class life a long time ago. 

         Nor do we believe in sex any more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it a generation ago: as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did not engage in, or discuss, or even invoke, without a certain amount of excitement and risk. We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it just doesn't carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedrooms of the 1950s. 

         Many enlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society in which sex generated not only emotion and power, but fear. For the moment, I wish to insist only on this one point: When sexuality loses its power to awe, it loses its power to create genuine swearing. When we convert it into a casual form of recreation, we shouldn't be surprised to hear linebackers using the word ""[expletive]"" on national television. 

         To profane something, in other words, one must believe in it. The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against them. 

         The instinctive response of most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it, but this is wrong. Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos and prohibitions, if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure and define themselves. By violating these taboos over and over, some succeed in defining themselves as rebels. Others violate them on special occasions to derive an emotional release. Forbidden language is one of the ways we remind children that there are rules to everyday life, and consequences for breaking them. When we forget this principle, or cease to accept it, it is not just our language that begins to fray at the edges. 

         What do we do about it? Well, we could pass a law against swearing. Mussolini actually did that. He decreed that trains and buses, in addition to running on time, had to carry signs that read ""Non bestemmiare per l'onore d'Italia."" (""Do not swear for the honor of Italy."") The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as you would expect: They cursed them. 

         What Mussolini could not do, I am reasonably sure that American governments of the 1990s cannot do, nor would I wish it. I merely predict that sometime in the coming generation, profanity will return in a meaningful way. It served too many purposes for too many years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis. We need it. 

         And so I am reasonably sure that when my children have children, there will once again be words so awesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences. This will not only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution, it will be a token of moral revival. What the dirty words will be, God only knows.

houlihan's
 
equation
by ... Walt Sheldon
The tiny spaceship had been built for a journey to a star. But its
 small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny—on Earth.
I must
 admit that at first I
 wasn't sure I was hearing those
 noises. It was in a park near the
 nuclear propulsion center—a cool,
 green spot, with the leaves all telling
 each other to hush, be quiet,
 and the soft breeze stirring them up
 again. I had known precisely such
 a secluded little green sanctuary just
 over the hill from Mr. Riordan's
 farm when I was a boy.


 Now it was a place I came to
 when I had a problem to thrash out.
 That morning I had been trying to
 work out an equation to give the
 coefficient of discharge for the matter
 in combustion. You may call it
 gas, if you wish, for we treated it
 like gas at the center for convenience—as
 it came from the rocket
 tubes in our engine.


 Without this coefficient to give
 us control, we would have lacked a
 workable equation when we set
 about putting the first moon rocket
 around those extraordinary engines
 of ours, which were still in the undeveloped
 blueprint stage.


 I see I shall have to explain this,
 although I had hoped to get right
 along with my story. When you
 start from scratch, matter discharged
 from any orifice has a velocity directly
 proportional to the square
 root of the pressure-head driving it.
 But when you actually put things
 together, contractions or expansions
 in the gas, surface roughness
 and other factors make the velocity
 a bit smaller.


 At the terrible discharge speed
 of nuclear explosion—which is
 what the drive amounts to despite
 the fact that it is simply water in
 which nuclear salts have been previously
 dissolved—this small factor
 makes quite a difference. I had
 to figure everything into it—diameter
 of the nozzle, sharpness of the
 edge, the velocity of approach to the
 point of discharge, atomic weight
 and structure— Oh, there is so
 much of this that if you're not a
 nuclear engineer yourself it's certain
 to weary you.


 Perhaps you had better take my
 word for it that without this equation—correctly
 stated, mind you—mankind
 would be well advised not
 to make a first trip to the moon.
 And all this talk of coefficients and
 equations sits strangely, you might
 say, upon the tongue of a man
 named Kevin Francis Houlihan.
 But I am, after all, a scientist. If I
 had not been a specialist in my field
 I would hardly have found myself
 engaged in vital research at the
 center.


 Anyway, I heard these little
 noises in the park. They sounded
 like small working sounds, blending
 in eerily mysterious fashion with a
 chorus of small voices. I thought at
 first it might be children at play,
 but then at the time I was a bit
 absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge
 of the trees, not wanting to deprive
 any small scalawags of their pleasure,
 and peered out between the
 branches. And what do you suppose
 I saw? Not children, but a
 group of little people, hard at work.


 There was a leader, an older one
 with a crank face. He was beating
 the air with his arms and piping:
 ""Over here, now! All right, bring
 those electrical connections over
 here—and see you're not slow as
 treacle about it!""


 There were perhaps fifty of the
 little people. I was more than startled
 by it, too. I had not seen little
 people in—oh, close to thirty years.
 I had seen them first as a boy of
 eight, and then, very briefly again,
 on my tenth birthday. And I had
 become convinced they could
never
be seen here in America. I had
 never seen them so busy, either.
 They were building something in
 the middle of the glade. It was long
 and shiny and upright and a little
 over five feet in height.


 ""Come along now, people!"" said
 this crotchety one, looking straight
 at me. ""Stop starin' and get to
 work! You'll not be needin' to
 mind that man standin' there! You
 know he can't see nor hear us!""


 Oh, it was good to hear the rich
 old tongue again. I smiled, and the
 foreman of the leprechauns—if
 that's what he was—saw me smile
 and became stiff and alert for a moment,
 as though suspecting that perhaps
 I actually could see him. Then
 he shrugged and turned away, clearly
 deeming such a thing impossible.


 I said, ""Just a minute, friend,
 and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens
 I
can
see you.""


 He whirled to face me again,
 staring open-mouthed. Then he
 said, ""What? What's that, now?""


 ""I can see you,"" I said.


 ""Ohhh!"" he said and put his
 palms to his cheekbones. ""Saints be
 with us! He's a believer! Run everybody—run
 for your lives!""


 And they all began running, in
 as many directions as there were
 little souls. They began to scurry
 behind the trees and bushes, and a
 sloping embankment nearby.


 ""No, wait!"" I said. ""Don't go
 away! I'll not be hurting you!""


 They continued to scurry.


 I knew what it was they feared.
 ""I don't intend catching one of
 you!"" I said. ""Come back, you daft
 little creatures!""


 But the glade was silent, and they
 had all disappeared. They thought I
 wanted their crock of gold, of
 course. I'd be entitled to it if I could
 catch one and keep him. Or so the
 legends affirmed, though I've wondered
 often about the truth of them.
 But I was after no gold. I only wanted
 to hear the music of an Irish
 tongue. I was lonely here in America,
 even if I had latched on to a fine
 job of work for almost shamefully
 generous pay. You see, in a place as
 full of science as the nuclear propulsion
 center there is not much
 time for the old things. I very much
 wanted to talk to the little people.


 I walked over to the center of
 the glade where the curious shiny
 object was standing. It was as
 smooth as glass and shaped like a
 huge cigar. There were a pair of
 triangular fins down at the bottom,
 and stubby wings amidships. Of
 course it was a spaceship, or a
 miniature replica of one. I looked
 at it more closely. Everything seemed
 almost miraculously complete
 and workable.


 I shook my head in wonder, then
 stepped back from the spaceship
 and looked about the glade. I knew
 they were all hiding nearby, watching
 me apprehensively. I lifted my
 head to them.


 ""Listen to me now, little people!""
 I called out. ""My name's
 Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.
 I am descended from King
 Niall himself—or so at least my
 father used to say! Come on out
 now, and pass the time o' day!""


 Then I waited, but they didn't
 answer. The little people always
 had been shy. Yet without reaching
 a decision in so many words I knew
 suddenly that I
had
to talk to them.
 I'd come to the glen to work out a
 knotty problem, and I was up
 against a blank wall. Simply because
 I was so lonely that my mind had
 become clogged.


 I knew that if I could just once
 hear the old tongue again, and talk
 about the old things, I might be able
 to think the problem through to a
 satisfactory conclusion.


 So I stepped back to the tiny
 spaceship, and this time I struck it
 a resounding blow with my fist.
 ""Hear me now, little people! If you
 don't show yourselves and come out
 and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship
 from stem to stern!""
I heard only the leaves rustling
 softly.


 ""Do you understand? I'll give
 you until I count three to make an
 appearance! One!""


 The glade remained deathly silent.


 ""Two!""


 I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,
 as if a small, brittle twig had
 snapped in the underbrush.


 ""
Three!
""


 And with that the little people
 suddenly appeared.


 The leader—he seemed more
 wizened and bent than before—approached
 me slowly and warily as I
 stood there. The others all followed
 at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure
 them and then waved my arm
 in a friendly gesture of greeting.


 ""Good morning,"" I said.


 ""Good morning,"" the foreman
 said with some caution. ""My name
 is Keech.""


 ""And mine's Houlihan, as I've
 told you. Are you convinced now
 that I have no intention of doing
 you any injury?""


 ""Mr. Houlihan,"" said Keech,
 drawing a kind of peppered dignity
 up about himself, ""in such matters
 I am never fully convinced. After
 living for many centuries I am all
 too acutely aware of the perversity
 of human nature.""


 ""Yes,"" I said. ""Well, as you will
 quickly see, all I want to do is
 talk."" I nodded as I spoke, and sat
 down cross-legged upon the grass.


 ""Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.
 Houlihan.""


 ""And often that's
all
he wants,""
 I said. ""Sit down with me now, and
 stop staring as if I were a snake
 returned to the Island.""


 He shook his head and remained
 standing. ""Have your say, Mr.
 Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate
 it if you'll go away and
 leave us to our work.""


 ""Well, now, your work,"" I said,
 and glanced at the spaceship.
 ""That's exactly what's got me curious.""


 The others had edged in a bit
 now and were standing in a circle,
 intently staring at me. I took out my
 pipe. ""Why,"" I asked, ""would a
 group of little people be building a
 spaceship here in America—out in
 this lonely place?""


 Keech stared back without much
 expression, and said, ""I've been
 wondering how you guessed it was
 a spaceship. I was surprised enough
 when you told me you could see us
 but not overwhelmingly so. I've run
 into believers before who could see
 the little people. It happens every
 so often, though not as frequently
 as it did a century ago. But knowing
 a spaceship at first glance! Well, I
 must confess that
does
astonish
 me.""


 ""And why wouldn't I know a
 spaceship when I see one?"" I said.
 ""It just so happens I'm a doctor of
 science.""


 ""A doctor of science, now,"" said
 Keech.


 ""Invited by the American government
 to work on the first moon
 rocket here at the nuclear propulsion
 center. Since it's no secret I
 can advise you of it.""


 ""A scientist, is it,"" said Keech.
 ""Well, now, that's very interesting.""


 ""I'll make no apologies for it,"" I
 said.


 ""Oh, there's no need for apology,""
 said Keech. ""Though in truth
 we prefer poets to scientists. But it
 has just now crossed my mind, Mr.
 Houlihan that you, being a scientist,
 might be of help to us.""


 ""How?"" I asked.


 ""Well, I might try starting at the
 beginning,"" he replied.


 ""You might,"" I said. ""A man
 usually does.""


 Keech took out his own pipe—a
 clay dudeen—and looked hopeful.
 I gave him a pinch of tobacco from
 my pouch. ""Well, now,"" he said,
 ""first of all you're no doubt surprised
 to find us here in America.""


 ""I am surprised from time to
 time to find myself here,"" I said.
 ""But continue.""


 ""We had to come here,"" said
 Keech, ""to learn how to make a
 spaceship.""


 ""A spaceship, now,"" I said, unconsciously
 adopting some of the
 old manner.


 ""Leprechauns are not really mechanically
 inclined,"" said Keech.
 ""Their major passions are music
 and laughter and mischief, as anyone
 knows.""


 ""Myself included,"" I agreed.
 ""Then why do you need a spaceship?""


 ""Well, if I may use an old expression,
 we've had a feelin' lately
 that we're not long for this world.
 Or let me put it this way. We feel
 the world isn't long for itself.""


 I scratched my cheek. ""How
 would a man unravel a statement
 such as that?""


 ""It's very simple. With all the
 super weapons you mortals have
 developed, there's the distinct possibility
 you might be blowin' us all
 up in the process of destroying
 yourselves.""


 ""There
is
that possibility,"" I said.


 ""Well, then, as I say,"" said
 Keech, ""the little people have decided
 to leave the planet in a spaceship.
 Which we're buildin' here and
 now. We've spied upon you and
 learned how to do it. Well—almost
 how to do it. We haven't learned
 yet how to control the power—""


 ""Hold on, now,"" I said. ""Leaving
 the planet, you say. And where
 would you be going?""


 ""There's another committee
 working on that. 'Tis not our concern.
 I was inclined to suggest the
 constellation Orion, which sounds
 as though it has a good Irish name,
 but I was hooted down. Be that as it
 may, my own job was to go into
 your nuclear center, learn how to
 make the ship, and proceed with its
 construction. Naturally, we didn't
 understand all of your high-flyin'
 science, but some of our people are
 pretty clever at gettin' up replicas
 of things.""


 ""You mean you've been spying
 on us at the center all this time? Do
 you know, we often had the feeling
 we were being watched, but we
 thought it was by the Russians.
 There's one thing which puzzles
 me, though. If you've been constantly
 around us—and I'm still
 able to see the little people—why
 did I never see you before?""


 ""It may be we never crossed your
 path. It may be you can only see us
 when you're thinkin' of us, and of
 course truly believin' in us. I don't
 know—'tis a thing of the mind, and
 not important at the moment.
 What's important is for us to get
 our first ship to workin' properly
 and then we'll be on our way.""


 ""You're determined to go.""


 ""Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.
 Now—to business. Just during
 these last few minutes a certain matter
 has crossed my mind. That's
 why I'm wastin' all this time with
 you, sir. You say you are a scientist.""


 ""A nuclear engineer.""


 ""Well, then, it may be that you
 can help us—now that you know
 we're here.""


 ""Help you?""


 ""The power control, Mr. Houlihan.
 As I understand it, 'tis necessary
 to know at any instant exactly
 how much thrust is bein' delivered
 through the little holes in back.
 And on paper it looks simple
 enough—the square of somethin' or
 other. I've got the figures jotted in
 a book when I need 'em. But when
 you get to doin' it it doesn't come
 out exactly as it does on paper.""


 ""You're referring to the necessity
 for a coefficient of discharge.""


 ""Whatever it might be named,""
 said Keech, shrugging. ""'Tis the
 one thing we lack. I suppose eventually
 you people will be gettin'
 around to it. But meanwhile we
 need it right now, if we're to make
 our ship move.""


 ""And you want me to help you
 with this?""


 ""That is exactly what crossed my
 mind.""


 I nodded and looked grave and
 kneaded my chin for a moment softly.
 ""Well, now, Keech,"" I said
 finally, ""why should I help you?""


 ""Ha!"" said Keech, grinning, but
 not with humor, ""the avarice of
 humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,
 I'll give you reason enough.
 The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!""


 ""The one at the end of the rainbow?""


 ""It's not at the end of the rainbow.
 That's a grandmother's tale.
 Nor is it actually in an earthen
 crock. But there's gold, all right,
 enough to make you rich for the
 rest of your life. And I'll make you
 a proposition.""


 ""Go ahead.""


 ""We'll not be needin' gold where
 we're goin'. It's yours if you show
 us how to make our ship work.""


 ""Well, now, that's quite an
 offer,"" I said. Keech had the goodness
 to be quiet while I sat and
 thought for a while. My pipe had
 gone out and I lit it again. I finally
 said, ""Let's have a look at your
 ship's drive and see what we can
 see.""


 ""You accept the proposition
 then?""


 ""Let's have a look,"" I said, and
 that was all.


 Well, we had a look, and then
 several looks, and before the morning
 was out we had half the spaceship
 apart, and were deep in argument
 about the whole project.


 It was a most fascinating session.
 I had often wished for a true working
 model at the center, but no allowance
 had been inserted in the
 budget for it. Keech brought me
 paper and pencil and I talked with
 the aid of diagrams, as engineers
 are wont to do. Although the pencils
 were small and I had to hold
 them between thumb and forefinger,
 as you would a needle, I was
 able to make many sensible observations
 and even a few innovations.


 I came back again the next day—and
 every day for the following
 two weeks. It rained several times,
 but Keech and his people made a
 canopy of boughs and leaves and I
 was comfortable enough. Every once
 in a while someone from the town
 or the center itself would pass by,
 and stop to watch me. But of course
 they wouldn't see the leprechauns
 or anything the leprechauns had
 made, not being believers.


 I would halt work, pass the time
 of day, and then, in subtle fashion,
 send the intruder on his way. Keech
 and the little people just stood by
 and grinned all the while.


 At the end of sixteen days I had
 the entire problem all but whipped.
 It is not difficult to understand why.
 The working model and the fact
 that the small people with their
 quick eyes and clever fingers could
 spot all sorts of minute shortcomings
 was a great help. And I was
 hearing the old tongue and talking
 of the old things every day, and
 truly that went far to take the clutter
 out of my mind. I was no longer
 so lonely that I couldn't think properly.


 On the sixteenth day I covered a
 piece of paper with tiny mathematical
 symbols and handed it to Keech.
 ""Here is your equation,"" I said. ""It
 will enable you to know your thrust
 at any given moment, under any
 circumstances, in or out of gravity,
 and under all conditions of friction
 and combustion.""


 ""Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,"" said
 Keech. All his people had gathered
 in a loose circle, as though attending
 a rite. They were all looking at
 me quietly.


 ""Mr. Houlihan,"" said Keech,
 ""you will not be forgotten by the
 leprechauns. If we ever meet again,
 upon another world perchance,
 you'll find our friendship always
 eager and ready.""


 ""Thank you,"" I said.


 ""And now, Mr. Houlihan,"" said
 Keech, ""I'll see that a quantity of
 gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,
 and so keep my part of the
 bargain.""


 ""I'll not be needing the gold,"" I
 said.


 Keech's eyebrows popped upward.
 ""What's this now?""


 ""I'll not be needing it,"" I repeated.
 ""I don't feel it would be
 right to take it for a service of this
 sort.""


 ""Well,"" said Keech in surprise,
 and in some awe, too, ""well, now,
 musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first
 time I ever heard such a speech
 from a mortal."" He turned to his
 people. ""We'll have three cheers
 now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan—friend
 of the little people as
 long as he shall live!""


 And they cheered. And little tears
 crept into the corners of some of
 their turned-up eyes.


 We shook hands, all of us, and I
 left.
I walked through the park, and
 back to the nuclear propulsion center.
 It was another cool, green morning
 with the leaves making only
 soft noises as the breezes came
 along. It smelled exactly like a
 wood I had known in Roscommon.


 And I lit my pipe and smoked it
 slowly and chuckled to myself at
 how I had gotten the best of the
 little people. Surely it was not every
 mortal who could accomplish that. I
 had given them the wrong equation,
 of course. They would never get
 their spaceship to work now, and
 later, if they tried to spy out the
 right information I would take special
 measures to prevent it, for I had
 the advantage of being able to see
 them.


 As for our own rocket ship, it
 should be well on its way by next
 St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed
 determined the true coefficient of
 discharge, which I never could have
 done so quickly without those sessions
 in the glade with Keech and
 his working model.


 It would go down in scientific
 literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's
 Equation, and that was honor
 and glory enough for me. I could
 do without Keech's pot of gold,
 though it would have been pleasant
 to be truly rich for a change.


 There was no sense in cheating
 him out of the gold to boot, for
 leprechauns are most clever in matters
 of this sort and he would have
 had it back soon enough—or else
 made it a burden in some way.


 Indeed, I had done a piece of
 work greatly to my advantage, and
 also to the advantage of humankind,
 and when a man can do the first and
 include the second as a fortunate byproduct
 it is a most happy accident.


 For if I had shown the little people
 how to make a spaceship they
 would have left our world. And
 this world, as long as it lasts—what
 would it be in that event? I ask you
 now, wouldn't we be even
more
likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom
 Come without the little people here
 for us to believe in every now and
 then?

I heard the voice as I opened my eyes. I was lying down, still not
 aware of where I was, waiting for the voice.


 ""Your name is David Corbin. Do you understand?""


 I looked in the direction of the sound. Above my feet a bulkhead
 loomed. There were round dials set in a row above a speaker. Over the
 mesh-covered speaker, two knobs glowed red. I ran the words over in
 my sluggish mind, thinking about an answer. The muscles in my throat
 tightened up in reflex as I tried to bring some unity into the jumble
 of thoughts and ideas that kept forming. One word formed out of the
 rush of anxiety.


 ""No.""


 I shouted a protest against the strangeness of the room. I looked to
 the right, my eyes following the curving ceiling that started at the
 cot. The curve met another straight bulkhead on the left. I was in a
 small room, gray in color, like dull metal. Overhead a bright light
 burned into my vision. I wondered where in the universe I was.


 ""Your name is David Corbin. If you understand, press button A on your
 right.""


 I stared at the speaker in the wall. The mesh-covered hole and the two
 lights looked like a caricature of a face, set in a panel of dials. I
 twisted my head to look for the button. I pushed away from the close
 wall but I couldn't move. I reached down to the tightness that held my
 body, found the wide strap that held me and fumbled with the buckle.
 I threw it off and pushed myself up from the hard cot. I heard myself
 yell in surprise as I floated up towards the light overhead.


 I was weightless.


 How do you describe being weightless when you are born into a world
 bound by gravity. I twisted and shut my eyes in terror. There was no
 sensation of place, no feeling of up or down, no direction. My back
 bumped against the ceiling and I opened my eyes to stare at the cot and
 floor. I was concentrating too hard on remembering to be frightened for
 long. I pushed away from the warm metal and the floor moved up to meet
 me.


 ""If you understand, press button A on your right.""


 What should I understand? That I was floating in a room that had a
 curved wall ... that nothing was right in this hostile room?


 When I reached the cot I held it and drew myself down. I glanced at the
 planes of the room, trying to place it with other rooms I could see in
 my mind. Gray walls with a crazy curved ceiling ... a door to my left
 that appeared to be air tight.


 I stared at my familiar hands. I rubbed them across my face, feeling
 the solidity of flesh and bone, afraid to think too hard about myself.


 ""My name ... my name is....""


 ""Your name is David Corbin.""


 I stared at the speaker. How long did this go on? The name meant
 nothing to me, but I thought about it, watching the relentless lights
 that shone below the dials. I stood up slowly and looked at myself. I
 was naked except for heavy shorts, and there was no clue to my name in
 the pockets. The room was warm and the air I had been breathing was
 good but it seemed wrong to be dressed like this. I didn't know why. I
 thought about insanity, and the room seemed to fit my thoughts. When
 the voice repeated the message again I had to act. Walking was like
 treading water that couldn't be seen or felt.


 I floated against the door, twisting the handle in fear that it
 wouldn't turn. The handle clanged as I pushed it down and I stared at
 the opposite wall of a narrow gray passageway. I pushed out into it and
 grasped the metal rail that ran along the wall. I reasoned it was there
 to propel yourself through the passageway in this weightless atmosphere.


 It was effortless to move. I turned on my side like a swimmer and went
 hand over hand, shooting down the corridor. I braced against forward
 motion and stopped against a door at the end. Behind me I could see the
 opened door I had left, and the thought of that questioning voice made
 me want to move. I swung the door open, catching a glimpse of a room
 crowded with equipment and....
I will always remember the scream of terror, the paralyzing fright of
 what I saw through the portholes in the wall of the room. I saw the
 blackest night, pierced by brilliance that blinded me. There was no
 depth to the searing brightness of countless stars. They seemed to
 press against the glass, blobs of fire against a black curtain burning
 into my eyes and brain.


 It was space.


 I looked out at deep space, star systems in clusters. I shut my eyes.
 When I looked again I knew where I was. Why the little room had been
 shaped like quarter round. Why I drifted weightlessly. Why I was....


 David Corbin.


 I knew more of the puzzle. Something was wrong. After the first shock
 of looking out, I accepted the fact that I was in a space ship, yet I
 couldn't read the maps that were fastened to a table, nor understand
 the function or design of the compact machinery.


 WHY, Why, Why? The thought kept pounding at me. I was afraid to touch
 anything in the room. I pressed against the clear window, wondering if
 the stars were familiar. I had a brief vivid picture of a night sky on
 Earth. This was not the same sky.


 Back in the room where I had awakened, I touched the panel with the
 glowing eyes. It had asked me if I understood. Now it must tell me why
 I didn't. It had to help me, that flat metallic voice that repeated the
 same words. It must tell me....


 ""Your name is David Corbin. If you understand, press button A on your
 right.""


 I pressed the button by the cot. The red lights blinked out as I stood
 in patient attention, trying to outguess the voice. I recalled a
 phrase ... some words about precaution.


 Precaution against forgetting.


 It was crazy, but I trusted the panel. It was the only thing I saw that
 could help me, guard me against another shock like seeing outside of
 the clear portholes.


 ""It is assumed the experiment is a success,"" the voice said.


 What experiment?


 ""You have been removed from suspension. Assume manual control of this
 ship.""


 Control of a ship? Going where?


 ""Do not begin operations until the others are removed from suspension.""


 What others? Tell me what to do.


 ""Rely on instructions for factoring when you check the coordinates.
 Your maximum deviation from schedule cannot exceed two degrees. Adopt
 emergency procedures as you see fit. Good luck.""


 The voice snapped off and I laughed hysterically. None of it had made
 sense, and I cursed whatever madness had put me here.


 ""Tell me what to do,"" I shouted wildly. I hammered the hard metal until
 the pain in my hands made me stop.


 ""I can't remember what to do.""


 I held my bruised hands to my mouth, and I knew that was all the
 message there was. In blind panic I pushed away from the panel.
 Something tripped me and I fell back in a graceless arc. I pushed away
 from the floor, barely feeling the pain in my leg, and went into the
 hall.


 Pain burned along my leg but I couldn't stop. In the first panic of
 waking up in strangeness I had missed the other doors in the passage.
 The first swung back to reveal a deep closet holding five bulky suits.
 The second room was like my own. A dark haired, deep chested man lay on
 the cot. His muscular body was secured by a wide belt. He was as still
 as death, motionless without warmth or breath as I hovered over him.


 I couldn't remember his face.


 The next room held another man. He was young and wiry, like an athlete
 cast in marble, dark haired and big jawed. A glassy eye stared up when
 I rolled back his eyelid. The eyelid remained open until I closed it
 and went on. Another room ... another man ... another stranger. This
 man was tall and raw boned, light of skin and hair, as dead as the
 others.


 A flat, illogical voice had instructed me to revive these men. I
 shivered in spite of the warmth of the room, studying the black box
 that squatted on a shelf by his head. My hand shook when I touched
 the metal. I dared not try to operate anything. Revive the others ...
 instructions without knowledge were useless to me. I stopped looking
 into the doors in the passageway and went back to the room with the
 portholes. Everything lay in readiness, fastened down star charts,
 instruments, glittering equipment. There was no feeling of disorder or
 use in the room. It waited for human hands to make it operate.


 Not mine. Not now.


 I went past the room into another, where the curves were more sharp. I
 could visualize the tapering hull leading to the nose of the ship. This
 room was filled with equipment that formed a room out of the bordered
 area I stood in. I sat in the deep chair facing the panel of dials and
 instruments, in easy reach. I ran my hands over the dials, the rows of
 smooth colored buttons, wondering.


 The ports on the side were shielded and I stared out at static energy,
 hung motionless in a world of searing light. There was no distortion,
 no movement outside and I glanced back at the dials. What speeds were
 they recording? What speeds and perhaps, what distance? It was useless
 to translate the markings. They stood for anything I might guess, and
 something kept pricking my mind, telling me I had no time to guess. I
 thought of time again. I was supposed to act according to ... plan. Did
 that mean ... in time ... in time. I went back down the passageway.
The fourth small room was the same. Except for the woman. She lay on a
 cot, young and beautiful, even in the death-like immobility I had come
 to accept. Her beauty was graceful lines of face and her figure—smooth
 tapering legs, soft curves that were carved out of flesh colored stone.
 Yet not stone. I held her small hand, then put it back on the cot. Her
 attire was brief like the rest of us, shorts and a man's shirt. Golden
 hair curled up around her lovely face. I wondered if she would ever
 smile or move that graceful head. I rolled back her eyelid and looked
 at a deep blue eye that stared back in glassy surprise. Four people in
 all, depending on a blind helpless fool who didn't know their names or
 the reason for that dependence. I sat beside her on the cot until I
 could stand it no longer.


 Searching the ship made me forget my fear. I hoped I would find some
 answers. I went from the nose to the last bulkhead in a frenzy of
 floating motion, looking behind each door until I went as far as I
 could. There were two levels to the ship. They both ended in the lead
 shield that was set where the swell of the curve was biggest. It meant
 the engine or engines took up half the ship, cut off from the forward
 half by the instrument studded shield. I retraced my steps and took a
 rough estimate of size. The ship, as I called it, was at least four
 hundred feet long, fifty feet in diameter on the inside.


 The silence was a force in itself, pressing down from the metal walls,
 driving me back to the comforting smallness of the room where I had
 been reborn. I laughed bitterly, thinking about the aptness of that. I
 had literally been reborn in this room, equipped with half ideas, and
 no point to start from, no premise to seek. I sensed the place to start
 from was back in the room. I searched it carefully.


 Minutes later I realized the apparatus by the cot was different. It
 was the same type of black box, but out from it was a metal arm, bent
 in a funny angle. At the tip of the arm, a needle gleamed dully and I
 rubbed the deep gash on my leg. I bent the arm back until the angle
 looked right. It was then I realized the needle came to a spot where it
 could have hit my neck when I lay down. My shout of excitement rang out
 in the room, as I pictured the action of the extended arm. I lost my
 sudden elation in the cabin where the girl lay. The box behind her head
 was completely closed, and it didn't yield to the pressure I applied.
 It had a cover, but no other opening where an arm could extend. I ran
 my fingers over the unbroken surface, prying over the thin crack at
 the base helplessly. If some sort of antidote was to be administered
 manually I was lost. I had no knowledge of what to inject or where to
 look for it. The chamber of the needle that had awakened me was empty.
 That meant a measured amount.


 In the laboratory on the lower level I went over the rows of cans and
 tubes fastened to the shelves. There were earths and minerals, seeds
 and chemicals, testing equipment in compact drawers, but nothing marked
 for me. I wondered if I was an engineer or a pilot, or perhaps a doctor
 sent along to safeguard the others. Complete amnesia would have been
 terrible enough but this half knowledge, part awareness and association
 with the ship was a frightening force that seemed ready to break out of
 me.


 I went back to the cabin where the powerful man lay. I had to risk
 failure with one of them. I didn't want it to be the girl. I fought
 down the thought that he might be the key man, remembering the voice
 that had given the message. It was up to me, and soon. The metal in the
 box would have withstood a bullet. It couldn't be pried apart, and I
 searched again and again for a release mechanism.


 I found it.


 I swung the massive cover off and set it down. The equipment waited for
 the touch of a button and it went into operation. I stepped back as the
 tubes glowed to life and the arm swung down with the gleaming needle.
 The needle went into the corded neck of the man. The fluid chamber
 drained under pressure and the arm moved back.


 I stood by the man for long minutes. Finally it came. He stirred
 restlessly, closing his hands into fists. The deep chest rose and fell
 unevenly as he breathed. Finally the eyes opened and he looked at me.
 I watched him adjust to the room. It was in his eyes, wide at first,
 moving about the confines of the room back to me.


 ""It looks like we made it,"" he said.


 ""Yes.""


 He unfastened the belt and sat up. I pushed him back as he floated up
 finding little humor in the comic expression on his face.


 ""No gravity,"" he grunted and sat back.


 ""You get used to it fast,"" I answered. I thought of what to say as he
 watched me. ""How do you feel?""


 He shrugged at the question. ""Fine, I guess. Funny, I can't remember.""


 He saw it in my face, making him stop. ""I can't remember dropping off
 to sleep,"" he finished.


 I held his hard arm. ""What else? How much do you remember?""


 ""I'm all right,"" he answered. ""There aren't supposed to be any effects
 from this.""


 ""Who is in charge of this ship?"" I asked.


 He tensed suddenly. ""You are, sir. Why?""


 I moved away from the cot. ""Listen, I can't remember. I don't know your
 name or anything about this ship.""


 ""What do you mean? What can't you remember?"" he asked. He stood up
 slowly, edging around towards the door. I didn't want to fight him. I
 wanted him to understand. ""Look, I'm in trouble. Nothing fits, except
 my name.""


 ""You don't know me?""


 ""No.""


 ""Are you serious?""


 ""Yes, yes. I don't know why but it's happened.""


 He let his breath out in a whistle. ""For God's sake. Any bump on your
 head?""


 ""I feel all right physically. I just can't place enough.""


 ""The others. What about the others?"" he blurted.


 ""I don't know. You're the first besides myself. I don't know how I
 stumbled on the way to revive you.""


 He shook his head, watching me like I was a freak. ""Let's check the
 rest right away.""


 ""Yes. I've got to know if they are like me. I'm afraid to think they
 might be.""


 ""Maybe it's temporary. We can figure something out.""
II


 The second man, the dark haired one, opened his eyes and recognized us.
 He asked questions in rapid fire excitement. The third man, the tall
 Viking, was all right until he moved. The weightless sensation made him
 violently sick. We put him back on the cot, securing him again with
 the belt, but the sight of us floating made him shake. He was retching
 without results when we drifted out. I followed him to the girl's
 quarters.


 ""What about her. Why is she here?"" I asked my companion.


 He lifted the cover from the apparatus. ""She's the chemist in the crew.""


 ""A girl?""


 ""Dr. Thiesen is an expert, trained for this,"" he said.


 I looked at her. She looked anything but like a chemist.


 ""There must be men who could have been sent. I've been wondering why a
 girl.""


 ""I don't know why, Captain. You tried to stop her before. Age and
 experience were all that mattered to the brass.""


 ""It's a bad thing to do.""


 ""I suppose. The mission stated one chemist.""


 ""What is the mission of this ship?"" I asked.


 He held up his hand. ""We'd better wait, sir. Everything was supposed to
 be all right on this end. First you, then Carl, sick to his stomach.""


 ""Okay. I'll hold the questions until we see about her.""


 We were out of luck with the girl. She woke up and she was frightened.
 We questioned her and she was coherent but she couldn't remember. I
 tried to smile as I sat on the cot, wondering what she was thinking.


 ""How do you feel?"" I asked.


 Her face was a mask of wide-eyed fear as she shook her head.


 ""Can you remember?""


 ""I don't know."" Blue eyes stared at me in fear. Her voice was low.


 ""Do you know my name?""


 The question frightened her. ""Should I? I feel so strange. Give me a
 minute to think.""


 I let her sit up slowly. ""Do you know your name?""


 She tightened up in my arms. ""Yes. It's...."" She looked at us for help,
 frightened by the lack of clothing we wore, by the bleak room. Her eyes
 circled the room. ""I'm afraid,"" she cried. I held her and she shook
 uncontrollably.


 ""What's happened to me?"" she asked.


 The dark haired man came into the room, silent and watchful. My
 companion motioned to him. ""Get Carl and meet us in Control.""


 The man looked at me and I nodded. ""We'll be there in a moment. I'm
 afraid we've got trouble.""


 He nodded and pushed away from us. The girl screamed and covered her
 face with her hands. I turned to the other man. ""What's your name?""


 ""Croft. John Croft.""


 ""John, what are your duties if any?""


 ""Automatic control. I helped to install it.""


 ""Can you run this ship? How about the other two?""


 He hit his hands together. ""You fly it, sir. Can't you think?""


 ""I'm trying. I know the ship is familiar, but I've looked it over.
 Maybe I'm trying too hard.""


 ""You flew her from earth until we went into suspension,"" he said.


 ""I can't remember when,"" I said. I held the trembling girl against me,
 shaking my head.


 He glanced at the girl. ""If the calculations are right it was more than
 a hundred years ago.""


 We assembled in the control room for a council. We were all a little
 better for being together. John Croft named the others for me. I
 searched each face without recognition. The blond man was Carl Herrick,
 a metallurgist. His lean face was white from his spell but he was
 better. Paul Sample was a biologist, John said. He was lithe and
 restless, with dark eyes that studied the rest of us. I looked at the
 girl. She was staring out of the ports, her hands pressed against the
 transparent break in the smooth wall. Karen Thiesen was a chemist, now
 frightened and trying to remember.


 I wasn't in much better condition. ""Look, if it comes too fast for me,
 for any of us, we'll stop. John, you can lead off.""


 ""You ask the questions,"" he said.


 I indicated the ship. ""Where in creation are we going?""


 ""We set out from Earth for a single star in the direction of the center
 of our Galaxy.""


 ""From Earth? How could we?""


 ""Let's move slowly, sir,"" he said. ""We're moving fast. I don't know if
 you can picture it, but we're going about one hundred thousand miles an
 hour.""


 ""Through space?""


 ""Yes.""


 ""What direction?""


 Paul cut in. ""It's a G type star, like our own sun in mass and
 luminosity. We hope to find a planetary system capable of supporting
 life.""


 ""I can't grasp it. How can we go very far in a lifetime?""


 ""It can be done in two lifetimes,"" John said quietly.


 ""You said I had flown this ship. You meant before this suspension.""


 ""Yes. That's why we can cross space to a near star.""


 ""How long ago was it?""


 ""It was set at about a hundred years, sir. Doesn't that fit at all?""


 ""I can't believe it's possible.""


 Carl caught my eye. ""Captain, we save this time without aging at all.
 It puts us near a calculated destination.""


 ""We've lost our lifetime."" It was Karen. She had been crying silently
 while we talked.


 ""Don't think about it,"" Paul said. ""We can still pull this out all
 right if you don't lose your nerve.""


 ""What are we to do?"" she asked.


 John answered for me. ""First we've got to find out where we are. I know
 this ship but I can't fly it.""


 ""Can I?"" I asked.
We set up a temporary plan of action. Paul took Karen to the laboratory
 in an effort to help her remember her job. Carl went back to divide the
 rations.


 I was to study the charts and manuals. It was better than doing
 nothing, and I went into the navigation room and sat down. Earth was
 an infinitesimal point somewhere behind us on the galactic plane, and
 no one else was trained to navigate. The ship thundered to life as I
 sat there. The blast roared once ... twice, then settled into a muted
 crescendo of sound that hummed through the walls. I went into the
 control room and watched John at the panel.


 ""I wish I knew what you were doing,"" I said savagely.


 ""Give it time.""


 ""We can't spare any, can we?"" I asked.


 ""I wish we knew. What about her—Dr. Thiesen?""


 ""She's in the lab. I don't think that will do much good. She's got to
 be shocked out of a mental state like that.""


 ""I guess you're right,"" he said slowly. ""She's trained to administer
 the suspension on the return trip.""


 I let my breath out slowly. ""I didn't think about that.""


 ""We couldn't even get part way back in a lifetime,"" he said.


 ""How old are you, John?""


 ""Twenty-eight.""


 ""What about me?""


 ""Thirty."" He stared at the panel in thought for a minutes. ""What about
 shock treatment? It sounds risky.""


 ""I know. It's the only thing I could think of. Why didn't everyone
 react the same?""


 ""That had me wondering for a while. I don't know. Anyway how could you
 go about making her remember?""


 ""Throw a crisis, some situation at her, I guess.""


 He shrugged, letting his sure hands rest on the panel of dials. I
 headed back towards the lab. If I could help her I might help myself.
 I was past the rooms when the horn blasted through the corridor. I
 turned automatically with the sound, pushing against the rail, towards
 the control room. Deep in my mind I could see danger, and without
 questioning why I knew I had to be at Control when the sound knifed
 through the stillness. John was shouting as I thrust my way into the
 room.
""Turn the ship. There's something dead ahead.""


 I had a glimpse of his contorted face as I dove at the control board.
 My hands hit buttons, thumbed a switch and then a sudden force threw me
 to the right. I slammed into the panel on the right, as the pressure
 of the change dimmed my vision. Reflex made me look up at the radar
 control screen.


 It wasn't operating.


 John let go of the padded chair, grinning weakly. I was busy for a few
 seconds, feeding compensation into the gyros. Relief flooded through me
 like warm liquid. I hung on the intercom for support, drawing air into
 my heaving lungs.


 ""What—made you—think of that,"" I asked weakly.


 ""Shock treatment.""


 ""I must have acted on instinct.""


 ""You did. Even for a sick man that was pretty fast,"" he laughed.


 ""I can think again, John. I know who I am,"" I shouted. I threw my arms
 around his massive shoulders. ""You did it.""


 ""You gave me the idea, Mister, talking about Dr. Thiesen.""


 ""It worked. I'm okay,"" I said in giddy relief.


 ""I don't have to tell you I was scared as hell. I wish you could have
 seen your face, the look in your eyes when I woke up.""


 ""I wouldn't want to wake up like that again.""


 ""You're all right now?"" he asked. I grinned and nodded an answer. I saw
 John as he was at the base, big and competent, sweating in the blazing
 sun.


 I thought about the rest of the crew too. ""We're heading right for a
 star....""


 ""It's been dead ahead for hours,"" he grunted. I leaned over and threw
 the intercom to open. ""This is control. Listen ... everyone. I'm over
 it. Disregard the warning siren ... we were testing the ship.""


 The lab light blinked on as Paul cut in. ""What was it ... hey, you said
 you're all right.""


 ""John did it. He hit the alarm figuring I would react. Listen, Paul. Is
 any one hurt?""


 ""No. Carl is here too. His stomach flopped again but he's okay. What
 about food. We're supposed to be checked before we eat.""


 ""We'll have to go ahead without it. Any change?""


 ""No, I put her to bed. Shall I bring food?""


 I glanced at John. He rubbed his stomach. ""Yes,"" I answered. ""Bring it
 when you can. I've got to find out where we are.""


 We had to get off course before we ran into the yellow-white star that
 had been picked for us. Food was set down by me, grew cold and was
 carried away and I was still rechecking the figures. We were on a line
 ten degrees above the galactic plane. The parallactic baseline from
 Earth to the single star could be in error several degrees, or we could
 be right on the calculated position of the star. The radar confirmed
 my findings ... and my worst fears. When we set it for direction and
 distance, the screen glowed to life and recorded the star dead ahead.


 In all the distant star clusters, only this G type star was thought to
 have a planetary system like our own. We were out on a gamble to find
 a planet capable of supporting life. The idea had intrigued scientists
 before I had first looked up at the night sky. When I was sure the
 electronically recorded course was accurate for time, I checked
 direction and speed from the readings and plotted our position. If I
 was right we were much closer than we wanted to be. The bright pips on
 the screen gave us the distance and size of the star while we fed the
 figures into the calculator for our rate of approach.


 Spectroscopic tests were run on the sun and checked against the figures
 that had been calculated on Earth. We analyzed temperature, magnetic
 fields, radial motion, density and luminosity, checking against the
 standards the scientists had constructed. It was a G type star like our
 own. It had more density and temperature and suitable planets or not,
 we had to change course in a hurry. Carl analyzed the findings while we
 came to a decision. Somewhere along an orbit that might be two hundred
 miles across, our hypothetical planet circled this star. That distance
 was selected when the planets in Earth's solar system had proved to be
 barren. If the observations on this star were correct, we could expect
 to find a planet in a state of fertility ... if it existed ... if it
 were suitable for colonization ... if we could find it.

Tack power drives on a sewing circle and
 
you can needle the world into the darndest mess!
""All right,"" I said, ""what
is
sociology good for?""


 Wilton Caswell, Ph.D., was head of my Sociology Department, and right
 then he was mad enough to chew nails. On the office wall behind him
 were three or four framed documents in Latin that were supposed to be
 signs of great learning, but I didn't care at that moment if he papered
 the walls with his degrees. I had been appointed dean and president
 to see to it that the university made money. I had a job to do, and I
 meant to do it.


 He bit off each word with great restraint: ""Sociology is the study of
 social institutions, Mr. Halloway.""


 I tried to make him understand my position. ""Look, it's the big-money
 men who are supposed to be contributing to the support of this college.
 To them, sociology sounds like socialism—nothing can sound worse than
 that—and an institution is where they put Aunt Maggy when she began
 collecting Wheaties in a stamp album. We can't appeal to them that way.
 Come on now."" I smiled condescendingly, knowing it would irritate him.
 ""What are you doing that's worth anything?""


 He glared at me, his white hair bristling and his nostrils dilated
 like a war horse about to whinny. I can say one thing for them—these
 scientists and professors always keep themselves well under control.
 He had a book in his hand and I was expecting him to throw it, but he
 spoke instead:


 ""This department's analysis of institutional accretion, by the use of
 open system mathematics, has been recognized as an outstanding and
 valuable contribution to—""


 The words were impressive, whatever they meant, but this still didn't
 sound like anything that would pull in money. I interrupted, ""Valuable
 in what way?""


 He sat down on the edge of his desk thoughtfully, apparently recovering
 from the shock of being asked to produce something solid for his
 position, and ran his eyes over the titles of the books that lined his
 office walls.


 ""Well, sociology has been valuable to business in initiating worker
 efficiency and group motivation studies, which they now use in
 management decisions. And, of course, since the depression, Washington
 has been using sociological studies of employment, labor and standards
 of living as a basis for its general policies of—""


 I stopped him with both raised hands. ""Please, Professor Caswell! That
 would hardly be a recommendation. Washington, the New Deal and the
 present Administration are somewhat touchy subjects to the men I have
 to deal with. They consider its value debatable, if you know what I
 mean. If they got the idea that sociology professors are giving advice
 and guidance—No, we have to stick to brass tacks and leave Washington
 out of this. What, specifically, has the work of this specific
 department done that would make it as worthy to receive money as—say,
 a heart disease research fund?""


 He began to tap the corner of his book absently on the desk, watching
 me. ""Fundamental research doesn't show immediate effects, Mr. Halloway,
 but its value is recognized.""


 I smiled and took out my pipe. ""All right, tell me about it. Maybe I'll
 recognize its value.""


 Prof. Caswell smiled back tightly. He knew his department was at stake.
 The other departments were popular with donors and pulled in gift
 money by scholarships and fellowships, and supported their professors
 and graduate students by research contracts with the government
 and industry. Caswell had to show a way to make his own department
 popular—or else. I couldn't fire him directly, of course, but there
 are ways of doing it indirectly.
He laid down his book and ran a hand over his ruffled hair.
 ""Institutions—organizations, that is—"" his voice became more
 resonant; like most professors, when he had to explain something he
 instinctively slipped into his platform lecture mannerisms, and began
 to deliver an essay—""have certain tendencies built into the way they
 happen to have been organized, which cause them to expand or contract
 without reference to the needs they were founded to serve.""


 He was becoming flushed with the pleasure of explaining his subject.
 ""All through the ages, it has been a matter of wonder and dismay
 to men that a simple organization—such as a church to worship in,
 or a delegation of weapons to a warrior class merely for defense
 against an outside enemy—will either grow insensately and extend its
 control until it is a tyranny over their whole lives, or, like other
 organizations set up to serve a vital need, will tend to repeatedly
 dwindle and vanish, and have to be painfully rebuilt.


 ""The reason can be traced to little quirks in the way they were
 organized, a matter of positive and negative power feedbacks. Such
 simple questions as, 'Is there a way a holder of authority in this
 organization can use the power available to him to increase his power?'
 provide the key. But it still could not be handled until the complex
 questions of interacting motives and long-range accumulations of minor
 effects could somehow be simplified and formulated. In working on the
 problem, I found that the mathematics of open system, as introduced
 to biology by Ludwig von Bertalanffy and George Kreezer, could be
 used as a base that would enable me to develop a specifically social
 mathematics, expressing the human factors of intermeshing authority and
 motives in simple formulas.


 ""By these formulations, it is possible to determine automatically the
 amount of growth and period of life of any organization. The UN, to
 choose an unfortunate example, is a shrinker type organization. Its
 monetary support is not in the hands of those who personally benefit
 by its governmental activities, but, instead, in the hands of those
 who would personally lose by any extension and encroachment of its
 authority on their own. Yet by the use of formula analysis—""


 ""That's theory,"" I said. ""How about proof?""


 ""My equations are already being used in the study of limited-size
 Federal corporations. Washington—""


 I held up my palm again. ""Please, not that nasty word again. I mean,
 where else has it been put into operation? Just a simple demonstration,
 something to show that it works, that's all.""


 He looked away from me thoughtfully, picked up the book and began to
 tap it on the desk again. It had some unreadable title and his name on
 it in gold letters. I got the distinct impression again that he was
 repressing an urge to hit me with it.


 He spoke quietly. ""All right, I'll give you a demonstration. Are you
 willing to wait six months?""


 ""Certainly, if you can show me something at the end of that time.""


 Reminded of time, I glanced at my watch and stood up.


 ""Could we discuss this over lunch?"" he asked.


 ""I wouldn't mind hearing more, but I'm having lunch with some
 executors of a millionaire's will. They have to be convinced that by,
 'furtherance of research into human ills,' he meant that the money
 should go to research fellowships for postgraduate biologists at the
 university, rather than to a medical foundation.""


 ""I see you have your problems, too,"" Caswell said, conceding me
 nothing. He extended his hand with a chilly smile. ""Well, good
 afternoon, Mr. Halloway. I'm glad we had this talk.""


 I shook hands and left him standing there, sure of his place in the
 progress of science and the respect of his colleagues, yet seething
 inside because I, the president and dean, had boorishly demanded that
 he produce something tangible.


 I frankly didn't give a hoot if he blew his lid. My job isn't easy.
 For a crumb of favorable publicity and respect in the newspapers and
 an annual ceremony in a silly costume, I spend the rest of the year
 going hat in hand, asking politely for money at everyone's door,
 like a well-dressed panhandler, and trying to manage the university
 on the dribble I get. As far as I was concerned, a department had to
 support itself or be cut down to what student tuition pays for, which
 is a handful of over-crowded courses taught by an assistant lecturer.
 Caswell had to make it work or get out.


 But the more I thought about it, the more I wanted to hear what he was
 going to do for a demonstration.
At lunch, three days later, while we were waiting for our order, he
 opened a small notebook. ""Ever hear of feedback effects?""


 ""Not enough to have it clear.""


 ""You know the snowball effect, though.""


 ""Sure, start a snowball rolling downhill and it grows.""


 ""Well, now—"" He wrote a short line of symbols on a blank page and
 turned the notebook around for me to inspect it. ""Here's the formula
 for the snowball process. It's the basic general growth formula—covers
 everything.""


 It was a row of little symbols arranged like an algebra equation. One
 was a concentric spiral going up, like a cross-section of a snowball
 rolling in snow. That was a growth sign.


 I hadn't expected to understand the equation, but it was almost as
 clear as a sentence. I was impressed and slightly intimidated by it.
 He had already explained enough so that I knew that, if he was right,
 here was the growth of the Catholic Church and the Roman Empire, the
 conquests of Alexander and the spread of the smoking habit and the
 change and rigidity of the unwritten law of styles.


 ""Is it really as simple as that?"" I asked.


 ""You notice,"" he said, ""that when it becomes too heavy for the cohesion
 strength of snow, it breaks apart. Now in human terms—""


 The chops and mashed potatoes and peas arrived.


 ""Go on,"" I urged.


 He was deep in the symbology of human motives and the equations of
 human behavior in groups. After running through a few different
 types of grower and shrinker type organizations, we came back to the
 snowball, and decided to run the test by making something grow.


 ""You add the motives,"" he said, ""and the equation will translate them
 into organization.""


 ""How about a good selfish reason for the ins to drag others into the
 group—some sort of bounty on new members, a cut of their membership
 fee?"" I suggested uncertainly, feeling slightly foolish. ""And maybe a
 reason why the members would lose if any of them resigned, and some
 indirect way they could use to force each other to stay in.""


 ""The first is the chain letter principle,"" he nodded. ""I've got
 that. The other...."" He put the symbols through some mathematical
 manipulation so that a special grouping appeared in the middle of the
 equation. ""That's it.""


 Since I seemed to have the right idea, I suggested some more, and he
 added some, and juggled them around in different patterns. We threw
 out a few that would have made the organization too complicated, and
 finally worked out an idyllically simple and deadly little organization
 setup where joining had all the temptation of buying a sweepstakes
 ticket, going in deeper was as easy as hanging around a race track, and
 getting out was like trying to pull free from a Malayan thumb trap. We
 put our heads closer together and talked lower, picking the best place
 for the demonstration.


 ""Abington?""


 ""How about Watashaw? I have some student sociological surveys of it
 already. We can pick a suitable group from that.""


 ""This demonstration has got to be convincing. We'd better pick a little
 group that no one in his right mind would expect to grow.""


 ""There should be a suitable club—""


 Picture Professor Caswell, head of the Department of Sociology, and
 with him the President of the University, leaning across the table
 toward each other, sipping coffee and talking in conspiratorial tones
 over something they were writing in a notebook.


 That was us.
""Ladies,"" said the skinny female chairman of the Watashaw Sewing
 Circle. ""Today we have guests."" She signaled for us to rise, and we
 stood up, bowing to polite applause and smiles. ""Professor Caswell, and
 Professor Smith."" (My alias.) ""They are making a survey of the methods
 and duties of the clubs of Watashaw.""


 We sat down to another ripple of applause and slightly wider smiles,
 and then the meeting of the Watashaw Sewing Circle began. In five
 minutes I began to feel sleepy.


 There were only about thirty people there, and it was a small room, not
 the halls of Congress, but they discussed their business of collecting
 and repairing second hand clothing for charity with the same endless
 boring parliamentary formality.


 I pointed out to Caswell the member I thought would be the natural
 leader, a tall, well-built woman in a green suit, with conscious
 gestures and a resonant, penetrating voice, and then went into a
 half doze while Caswell stayed awake beside me and wrote in his
 notebook. After a while the resonant voice roused me to attention for
 a moment. It was the tall woman holding the floor over some collective
 dereliction of the club. She was being scathing.


 I nudged Caswell and murmured, ""Did you fix it so that a shover has a
 better chance of getting into office than a non-shover?""


 ""I think there's a way they could find for it,"" Caswell whispered back,
 and went to work on his equation again. ""Yes, several ways to bias the
 elections.""


 ""Good. Point them out tactfully to the one you select. Not as if
 she'd use such methods, but just as an example of the reason why only
she
can be trusted with initiating the change. Just mention all the
 personal advantages an unscrupulous person could have.""


 He nodded, keeping a straight and sober face as if we were exchanging
 admiring remarks about the techniques of clothes repairing, instead of
 conspiring.


 After the meeting, Caswell drew the tall woman in the green suit
 aside and spoke to her confidentially, showing her the diagram of
 organization we had drawn up. I saw the responsive glitter in the
 woman's eyes and knew she was hooked.


 We left the diagram of organization and our typed copy of the new
 bylaws with her and went off soberly, as befitted two social science
 experimenters. We didn't start laughing until our car passed the town
 limits and began the climb for University Heights.


 If Caswell's equations meant anything at all, we had given that sewing
 circle more growth drives than the Roman Empire.
Four months later I had time out from a very busy schedule to wonder
 how the test was coming along. Passing Caswell's office, I put my head
 in. He looked up from a student research paper he was correcting.


 ""Caswell, about that sewing club business—I'm beginning to feel the
 suspense. Could I get an advance report on how it's coming?""


 ""I'm not following it. We're supposed to let it run the full six
 months.""


 ""But I'm curious. Could I get in touch with that woman—what's her
 name?""


 ""Searles. Mrs. George Searles.""


 ""Would that change the results?""


 ""Not in the slightest. If you want to graph the membership rise, it
 should be going up in a log curve, probably doubling every so often.""


 I grinned. ""If it's not rising, you're fired.""


 He grinned back. ""If it's not rising, you won't have to fire me—I'll
 burn my books and shoot myself.""


 I returned to my office and put in a call to Watashaw.


 While I was waiting for the phone to be answered, I took a piece of
 graph paper and ruled it off into six sections, one for each month.
 After the phone had rung in the distance for a long time, a servant
 answered with a bored drawl:


 ""Mrs. Searles' residence.""


 I picked up a red gummed star and licked it.


 ""Mrs. Searles, please.""


 ""She's not in just now. Could I take a message?""


 I placed the star at the thirty line in the beginning of the first
 section. Thirty members they'd started with.


 ""No, thanks. Could you tell me when she'll be back?""


 ""Not until dinner. She's at the meetin'.""


 ""The sewing club?"" I asked.


 ""No, sir, not that thing. There isn't any Sewing club any more, not
 for a long time. She's at the Civic Welfare meeting.""


 Somehow I hadn't expected anything like that.


 ""Thank you,"" I said and hung up, and after a moment noticed I was
 holding a box of red gummed stars in my hand. I closed it and put it
 down on top of the graph of membership in the sewing circle. No more
 members....


 Poor Caswell. The bet between us was ironclad. He wouldn't let me
 back down on it even if I wanted to. He'd probably quit before I put
 through the first slow move to fire him. His professional pride would
 be shattered, sunk without a trace. I remembered what he said about
 shooting himself. It had seemed funny to both of us at the time,
 but.... What a mess
that
would make for the university.


 I had to talk to Mrs. Searles. Perhaps there was some outside reason
 why the club had disbanded. Perhaps it had not just died.


 I called back. ""This is Professor Smith,"" I said, giving the alias I
 had used before. ""I called a few minutes ago. When did you say Mrs.
 Searles will return?""


 ""About six-thirty or seven o'clock.""


 Five hours to wait.


 And what if Caswell asked me what I had found out in the meantime? I
 didn't want to tell him anything until I had talked it over with that
 woman Searles first.


 ""Where is this Civic Welfare meeting?""


 She told me.


 Five minutes later, I was in my car, heading for Watashaw, driving
 considerably faster than my usual speed and keeping a careful watch for
 highway patrol cars as the speedometer climbed.
The town meeting hall and theater was a big place, probably with lots
 of small rooms for different clubs. I went in through the center door
 and found myself in the huge central hall where some sort of rally was
 being held. A political-type rally—you know, cheers and chants, with
 bunting already down on the floor, people holding banners, and plenty
 of enthusiasm and excitement in the air. Someone was making a speech up
 on the platform. Most of the people there were women.


 I wondered how the Civic Welfare League could dare hold its meeting at
 the same time as a political rally that could pull its members away.
 The group with Mrs. Searles was probably holding a shrunken and almost
 memberless meeting somewhere in an upper room.


 There probably was a side door that would lead upstairs.


 While I glanced around, a pretty girl usher put a printed bulletin in
 my hand, whispering, ""Here's one of the new copies."" As I attempted to
 hand it back, she retreated. ""Oh, you can keep it. It's the new one.
 Everyone's supposed to have it. We've just printed up six thousand
 copies to make sure there'll be enough to last.""


 The tall woman on the platform had been making a driving, forceful
 speech about some plans for rebuilding Watashaw's slum section. It
 began to penetrate my mind dimly as I glanced down at the bulletin in
 my hands.


 ""Civic Welfare League of Watashaw. The United Organization of Church
 and Secular Charities."" That's what it said. Below began the rules of
 membership.


 I looked up. The speaker, with a clear, determined voice and conscious,
 forceful gestures, had entered the homestretch of her speech, an appeal
 to the civic pride of all citizens of Watashaw.


 ""With a bright and glorious future—potentially without poor and
 without uncared-for ill—potentially with no ugliness, no vistas which
 are not beautiful—the best people in the best planned town in the
 country—the jewel of the United States.""


 She paused and then leaned forward intensely, striking her clenched
 hand on the speaker's stand with each word for emphasis.


 ""
All we need is more members. Now get out there and recruit!
""


 I finally recognized Mrs. Searles, as an answering sudden blast of
 sound half deafened me. The crowd was chanting at the top of its lungs:
 ""Recruit! Recruit!""


 Mrs. Searles stood still at the speaker's table and behind her,
 seated in a row of chairs, was a group that was probably the board of
 directors. It was mostly women, and the women began to look vaguely
 familiar, as if they could be members of the sewing circle.


 I put my lips close to the ear of the pretty usher while I turned over
 the stiff printed bulletin on a hunch. ""How long has the League been
 organized?"" On the back of the bulletin was a constitution.


 She was cheering with the crowd, her eyes sparkling. ""I don't know,""
 she answered between cheers. ""I only joined two days ago. Isn't it
 wonderful?""


 I went into the quiet outer air and got into my car with my skin
 prickling. Even as I drove away, I could hear them. They were singing
 some kind of organization song with the tune of ""Marching through
 Georgia.""


 Even at the single glance I had given it, the constitution looked
 exactly like the one we had given the Watashaw Sewing Circle.


 All I told Caswell when I got back was that the sewing circle had
 changed its name and the membership seemed to be rising.
Next day, after calling Mrs. Searles, I placed some red stars on my
 graph for the first three months. They made a nice curve, rising more
 steeply as it reached the fourth month. They had picked up their first
 increase in membership simply by amalgamating with all the other types
 of charity organizations in Watashaw, changing the club name with each
 fusion, but keeping the same constitution—the constitution with the
 bright promise of advantages as long as there were always new members
 being brought in.


 By the fifth month, the League had added a mutual baby-sitting service
 and had induced the local school board to add a nursery school to the
 town service, so as to free more women for League activity. But charity
 must have been completely organized by then, and expansion had to be in
 other directions.


 Some real estate agents evidently had been drawn into the whirlpool
 early, along with their ideas. The slum improvement plans began to
 blossom and take on a tinge of real estate planning later in the month.


 The first day of the sixth month, a big two page spread appeared in
 the local paper of a mass meeting which had approved a full-fledged
 scheme for slum clearance of Watashaw's shack-town section, plus plans
 for rehousing, civic building, and rezoning.
And
good prospects
 for attracting some new industries to the town, industries which had
 already been contacted and seemed interested by the privileges offered.


 And with all this, an arrangement for securing and distributing to the
 club members
alone
most of the profit that would come to the town in
 the form of a rise in the price of building sites and a boom in the
 building industry. The profit distributing arrangement was the same one
 that had been built into the organization plan for the distribution
 of the small profits of membership fees and honorary promotions. It
 was becoming an openly profitable business. Membership was rising more
 rapidly now.


 By the second week of the sixth month, news appeared in the local paper
 that the club had filed an application to incorporate itself as the
 Watashaw Mutual Trade and Civic Development Corporation, and all the
 local real estate promoters had finished joining en masse. The Mutual
 Trade part sounded to me as if the Chamber of Commerce was on the point
 of being pulled in with them, ideas, ambitions and all.


 I chuckled while reading the next page of the paper, on which a local
 politician was reported as having addressed the club with a long
 flowery oration on their enterprise, charity, and civic spirit. He
 had been made an honorary member. If he allowed himself to be made a
full
member with its contractual obligations and its lures, if the
 politicians went into this, too....


 I laughed, filing the newspaper with the other documents on the
 Watashaw test. These proofs would fascinate any businessman with the
 sense to see where his bread was buttered. A businessman is constantly
 dealing with organizations, including his own, and finding them either
 inert, cantankerous, or both. Caswell's formula could be a handle to
 grasp them with. Gratitude alone would bring money into the university
 in carload lots.
The end of the sixth month came. The test was over and the end reports
 were spectacular. Caswell's formulas were proven to the hilt.


 After reading the last newspaper reports, I called him up.


 ""Perfect, Wilt,
perfect
! I can use this Watashaw thing to get you so
 many fellowships and scholarships and grants for your department that
 you'll think it's snowing money!""


 He answered somewhat disinterestedly, ""I've been busy working with
 students on their research papers and marking tests—not following the
 Watashaw business at all, I'm afraid. You say the demonstration went
 well and you're satisfied?""


 He was definitely putting on a chill. We were friends now, but
 obviously he was still peeved whenever he was reminded that I had
 doubted that his theory could work. And he was using its success to
 rub my nose in the realization that I had been wrong. A man with a
 string of degrees after his name is just as human as anyone else. I had
 needled him pretty hard that first time.


 ""I'm satisfied,"" I acknowledged. ""I was wrong. The formulas work
 beautifully. Come over and see my file of documents on it if you want a
 boost for your ego. Now let's see the formula for stopping it.""


 He sounded cheerful again. ""I didn't complicate that organization
 with negatives. I wanted it to
grow
. It falls apart naturally when
 it stops growing for more than two months. It's like the great stock
 boom before an economic crash. Everyone in it is prosperous as long as
 the prices just keep going up and new buyers come into the market, but
 they all knew what would happen if it stopped growing. You remember, we
 built in as one of the incentives that the members know they are going
 to lose if membership stops growing. Why, if I tried to stop it now,
 they'd cut my throat.""


 I remembered the drive and frenzy of the crowd in the one early meeting
 I had seen. They probably would.


 ""No,"" he continued. ""We'll just let it play out to the end of its
 tether and die of old age.""


 ""When will that be?""


 ""It can't grow past the female population of the town. There are only
 so many women in Watashaw, and some of them don't like sewing.""


 The graph on the desk before me began to look sinister. Surely Caswell
 must have made some provision for—


 ""You underestimate their ingenuity,"" I said into the phone. ""Since they
 wanted to expand, they didn't stick to sewing. They went from general
 charity to social welfare schemes to something that's pretty close to
 an incorporated government. The name is now the Watashaw Mutual Trade
 and Civic Development Corporation, and they're filing an application
 to change it to Civic Property Pool and Social Dividend, membership
 contractual, open to all. That social dividend sounds like a Technocrat
 climbed on the band wagon, eh?""


 While I spoke, I carefully added another red star to the curve above
 the thousand member level, checking with the newspaper that still lay
 open on my desk. The curve was definitely some sort of log curve now,
 growing more rapidly with each increase.


 ""Leaving out practical limitations for a moment, where does the formula
 say it will stop?"" I asked.


 ""When you run out of people to join it. But after all, there are only
 so many people in Watashaw. It's a pretty small town.""
""They've opened a branch office in New York,"" I said carefully into the
 phone, a few weeks later.


 With my pencil, very carefully, I extended the membership curve from
 where it was then.


 After the next doubling, the curve went almost straight up and off the
 page.


 Allowing for a lag of contagion from one nation to another, depending
 on how much their citizens intermingled, I'd give the rest of the world
 about twelve years.


 There was a long silence while Caswell probably drew the same graph
 in his own mind. Then he laughed weakly. ""Well, you asked me for a
 demonstration.""


 That was as good an answer as any. We got together and had lunch in a
 bar, if you can call it lunch. The movement we started will expand by
 hook or by crook, by seduction or by bribery or by propaganda or by
 conquest, but it will expand. And maybe a total world government will
 be a fine thing—until it hits the end of its rope in twelve years or
 so.


 What happens then, I don't know.


 But I don't want anyone to pin that on me. From now on, if anyone asks
 me, I've never heard of Watashaw.

The first man to return from beyond the Great Frontier may be
 welcomed ... but will it be as a curiosity, rather than as a
 hero...?
There was the usual welcoming crowd for a celebrity, and the usual
 speeches by the usual politicians who met him at the airport which had
 once been twenty miles outside of Croton, but which the growing city had
 since engulfed and placed well within its boundaries. But everything
 wasn't usual. The crowd was quiet, and the mayor didn't seem quite as
 at-ease as he'd been on his last big welcoming—for Corporal Berringer,
 one of the crew of the spaceship
Washington
, first to set Americans
 upon Mars. His Honor's handclasp was somewhat moist and cold. His
 Honor's eyes held a trace of remoteness.


 Still, he was the honored home-comer, the successful returnee, the
 hometown boy who had made good in a big way, and they took the triumphal
 tour up Main Street to the new square and the grandstand. There he sat
 between the mayor and a nervous young coed chosen as homecoming queen,
 and looked out at the police and fire department bands, the National
 Guard, the boy scouts and girl scouts, the Elks and Masons. Several of
 the churches in town had shown indecision as to how to instruct their
 parishioners to treat him. But they had all come around. The tremendous
 national interest, the fact that he was the First One, had made them
 come around. It was obvious by now that they would have to adjust as
 they'd adjusted to all the other firsts taking place in these—as the
 newspapers had dubbed the start of the Twenty-first Century—the
 Galloping Twenties.


 He was glad when the official greeting was over. He was a very tired man
 and he had come farther, traveled longer and over darker country, than
 any man who'd ever lived before. He wanted a meal at his own table, a
 kiss from his wife, a word from his son, and later to see some old
 friends and a relative or two. He didn't want to talk about the journey.
 He wanted to forget the immediacy, the urgency, the terror; then perhaps
 he would talk.


 Or would he? For he had very little to tell. He had traveled and he had
 returned and his voyage was very much like the voyages of the great
 mariners, from Columbus onward—long, dull periods of time passing,
 passing, and then the arrival.


 The house had changed. He saw that as soon as the official car let him
 off at 45 Roosevelt Street. The change was, he knew, for the better.
 They had put a porch in front. They had rehabilitated, spruced up,
 almost rebuilt the entire outside and grounds. But he was sorry. He had
 wanted it to be as before.


 The head of the American Legion and the chief of police, who had
 escorted him on this trip from the square, didn't ask to go in with him.
 He was glad. He'd had enough of strangers. Not that he was through with
 strangers. There were dozens of them up and down the street, standing
 beside parked cars, looking at him. But when he looked back at them,
 their eyes dropped, they turned away, they began moving off. He was
 still too much the First One to have his gaze met.


 He walked up what had once been a concrete path and was now an ornate
 flagstone path. He climbed the new porch and raised the ornamental
 knocker on the new door and heard the soft music sound within. He was
 surprised that he'd had to do this. He'd thought Edith would be watching
 at a window.


 And perhaps she
had
been watching ... but she hadn't opened the door.


 The door opened; he looked at her. It hadn't been too long and she
 hadn't changed at all. She was still the small, slender girl he'd loved
 in high school, the small, slender woman he'd married twelve years ago.
 Ralphie was with her. They held onto each other as if seeking mutual
 support, the thirty-three-year old woman and ten-year-old boy. They
 looked at him, and then both moved forward, still together. He said,
 ""It's good to be home!""


 Edith nodded and, still holding to Ralphie with one hand, put the other
 arm around him. He kissed her—her neck, her cheek—and all the old
 jokes came to mind, the jokes of travel-weary, battle-weary men, the
 and-
then
-I'll-put-my-pack-aside jokes that spoke of terrible hunger.
 She was trembling, and even as her lips came up to touch his he felt the
 difference, and because of this difference he turned with urgency to
 Ralphie and picked him up and hugged him and said, because he could
 think of nothing else to say, ""What a big fella, what a big fella.""


 Ralphie stood in his arms as if his feet were still planted on the
 floor, and he didn't look at his father but somewhere beyond him. ""I
 didn't grow much while you were gone, Dad, Mom says I don't eat enough.""


 So he put him down and told himself that it would all change, that
 everything would loosen up just as his commanding officer, General
 Carlisle, had said it would early this morning before he left
 Washington.


 ""Give it some time,"" Carlisle had said. ""You need the time; they need
 the time. And for the love of heaven, don't be sensitive.""
Edith was leading him into the living room, her hand lying still in his,
 a cool, dead bird lying still in his. He sat down on the couch, she sat
 down beside him—but she had hesitated. He
wasn't
being sensitive; she
 had hesitated. His wife had hesitated before sitting down beside him.


 Carlisle had said his position was analogous to Columbus', to Vasco De
 Gama's, to Preshoff's when the Russian returned from the Moon—but more
 so. Carlisle had said lots of things, but even Carlisle who had worked
 with him all the way, who had engineered the entire fantastic
 journey—even Carlisle the Nobel prize winner, the multi-degreed genius
 in uniform, had not actually spoken to him as one man to another.
The eyes. It always showed in their eyes.
He looked across the room at Ralphie, standing in the doorway, a boy
 already tall, already widening in the shoulders, already large of
 feature. It was like looking into the mirror and seeing himself
 twenty-five years ago. But Ralphie's face was drawn, was worried in a
 way that few ten-year-old faces are.


 ""How's it going in school?"" he asked.


 ""Gee, Dad, it's the second month of summer vacation.""


 ""Well, then, before summer vacation?""


 ""Pretty good.""


 Edith said, ""He made top forum the six-month period before vacation, and
 he made top forum the six-month period you went away, Hank.""


 He nodded, remembering that, remembering everything, remembering the
 warmth of her farewell, the warmth of Ralphie's farewell, their tears as
 he left for the experimental flight station in the Aleutians. They had
 feared for him, having read of the many launchings gone wrong even in
 continent-to-continent experimental flight.


 They had been right to worry. He had suffered much after that blow-up.
 But now they should be rejoicing, because he had survived and made the
 long journey. Ralphie suddenly said, ""I got to go, Dad. I promised Walt
 and the others I'd pitch. It's Inter-Town Little League, you know. It's
 Harmon, you know. I got to keep my word."" Without waiting for an answer,
 he waved his hand—it shook; a ten-year-old boy's hand that shook—and
 ran from the room and from the house.


 He and Edith sat beside each other, and he wanted badly to take her in
 his arms, and yet he didn't want to oppress her. He stood up. ""I'm very
 tired. I'd like to lie down a while."" Which wasn't true, because he'd
 been lying down all the months of the way back.


 She said, ""Of course. How stupid of me, expecting you to sit around and
 make small talk and pick up just where you left off.""


 He nodded. But that was exactly what he wanted to do—make small talk
 and pick up just where he'd left off. But they didn't expect it of him;
 they wouldn't let him; they felt he had changed too much.
She led him upstairs and along the foyer past Ralphie's room and past
 the small guest room to their bedroom. This, too, had changed. It was
 newly painted and it had new furniture. He saw twin beds separated by an
 ornate little table with an ornate little lamp, and this looked more
 ominous a barrier to him than the twelve-foot concrete-and-barbed-wire
 fence around the experimental station.


 ""Which one is mine,"" he asked, and tried to smile.


 She also tried to smile. ""The one near the window. You always liked the
 fresh air, the sunshine in the morning. You always said it helped you
 to get up on time when you were stationed at the base outside of town.
 You always said it reminded you—being able to see the sky—that you
 were going to go up in it, and that you were going to come down from it
 to this bed again.""


 ""Not this bed,"" he murmured, and was a little sorry afterward.


 ""No, not this bed,"" she said quickly. ""Your lodge donated the bedroom
 set and I really didn't know—"" She waved her hand, her face white.


 He was sure then that she
had
known, and that the beds and the barrier
 between them were her own choice, if only an unconscious choice. He went
 to the bed near the window, stripped off his Air Force blue jacket,
 began to take off his shirt, but then remembered that some arm scars
 still showed. He waited for her to leave the room.


 She said, ""Well then, rest up, dear,"" and went out.


 He took off his shirt and saw himself in the mirror on the opposite
 wall; and then took off his under-shirt. The body scars were faint, the
 scars running in long lines, one dissecting his chest, the other slicing
 diagonally across his upper abdomen to disappear under his trousers.
 There were several more on his back, and one on his right thigh. They'd
 been treated properly and would soon disappear. But she had never seen
 them.


 Perhaps she never would. Perhaps pajamas and robes and dark rooms would
 keep them from her until they were gone.


 Which was not what he'd considered at all important on leaving Walter
 Reed Hospital early this morning; which was something he found
 distasteful, something he felt beneath them both. And, at the same time,
 he began to understand that there would be many things, previously
 beneath them both, which would have to be considered. She had changed;
 Ralphie had changed; all the people he knew had probably
 changed—because they thought
he
had changed.


 He was tired of thinking. He lay down and closed his eyes. He let
 himself taste bitterness, unhappiness, a loneliness he had never known
 before.


 But sometime later, as he was dozing off, a sense of reassurance began
 filtering into his mind. After all, he was still Henry Devers, the same
 man who had left home eleven months ago, with a love for family and
 friends which was, if anything, stronger than before. Once he could
 communicate this, the strangeness would disappear and the First One
 would again become good old Hank. It was little enough to ask for—a
 return to old values, old relationships, the normalcies of the backwash
 instead of the freneticisms of the lime-light. It would certainly be
 granted to him.


 He slept.
Dinner was at seven
 p.m.
 His mother came; his Uncle Joe and Aunt Lucille
 came. Together with Edith, Ralphie and himself, they made six, and ate
 in the dining room at the big table.


 Before he'd become the First One, it would have been a noisy affair. His
 family had never been noted for a lack of ebullience, a lack of
 talkativeness, and Ralphie had always chosen mealtimes—especially with
 company present—to describe everything and anything that had happened
 to him during the day. And Edith herself had always chatted, especially
 with his mother, though they didn't agree about much. Still, it had been
 good-natured; the general tone of their lives had been good-natured.


 This wasn't good-natured. Exactly what it was he wasn't sure. ""Stiff""
 was perhaps the word.


 They began with grapefruit, Edith and Mother serving quickly,
 efficiently from the kitchen, then sitting down at the table. He looked
 at Mother as he raised his first spoonful of chilled fruit, and said,
 ""Younger than ever."" It was nothing new; he'd said it many many times
 before, but his mother had always reacted with a bright smile and a quip
 something like, ""Young for the Golden Age Center, you mean."" This time
 she burst into tears. It shocked him. But what shocked him even more was
 the fact that no one looked up, commented, made any attempt to comfort
 her; no one indicated in any way that a woman was sobbing at the table.


 He was sitting directly across from Mother, and reached out and touched
 her left hand which lay limply beside the silverware. She didn't move
 it—she hadn't touched him once beyond that first, quick, strangely-cool
 embrace at the door—then a few seconds later she withdrew it and let it
 drop out of sight.


 So there he was, Henry Devers, at home with the family. So there he was,
 the hero returned, waiting to be treated as a human being.


 The grapefruit shells were cleaned away and the soup served. Uncle Joe
 began to talk. ""The greatest little development of circular uniform
 houses you ever did see,"" he boomed in his powerful salesman's voice.
 ""Still going like sixty. We'll sell out before—"" At that point he
 looked at Hank, and Hank nodded encouragement, desperately interested in
 this normalcy, and Joe's voice died away. He looked down at his plate,
 mumbled, ""Soup's getting cold,"" and began to eat. His hand shook a
 little; his ruddy face was not quite as ruddy as Hank remembered it.


 Aunt Lucille made a few quavering statements about the Ladies' Tuesday
 Garden Club, and Hank looked across the table to where she sat between
 Joe and Mother—his wife and son bracketed him, and yet he felt
 alone—and said, ""I've missed fooling around with the lawn and the rose
 bushes. Here it is August and I haven't had my hand to a mower or
 trowel.""


 Aunt Lucille smiled, if you could call it that—a pitiful twitching of
 the lips—and nodded. She threw her eyes in his direction, and past him,
 and then down to her plate. Mother, who was still sniffling, said, ""I
 have a dismal headache. I'm going to lie down in the guest room a
 while."" She touched his shoulder in passing—his affectionate, effusive
 mother who would kiss stray dogs and strange children, who had often
 irritated him with an excess of physical and verbal caresses—she barely
 touched his shoulder and fled.


 So now five of them sat at the table. The meat was served—thin, rare
 slices of beef, the pink blood-juice oozing warmly from the center. He
 cut into it and raised a forkful to his mouth, then glanced at Ralphie
 and said, ""Looks fresh enough to have been killed in the back yard.""
 Ralphie said, ""Yeah, Dad."" Aunt Lucille put down her knife and fork and
 murmured something to her husband. Joe cleared his throat and said
 Lucille was rapidly becoming a vegetarian and he guessed she was going
 into the living room for a while. ""She'll be back for dessert, of
 course,"" he said, his laugh sounding forced.


 Hank looked at Edith; Edith was busy with her plate. Hank looked at
 Ralphie; Ralphie was busy with his plate. Hank looked at Joe; Joe was
 chewing, gazing out over their heads to the kitchen. Hank looked at
 Lucille; she was disappearing into the living room.


 He brought his fist down on the table. The settings jumped; a glass
 overturned, spilling water. He brought it down again and again. They
 were all standing now. He sat there and pounded the table with his big
 right fist—Henry Devers, who would never have thought of making such a
 scene before, but who was now so sick and tired of being treated as the
 First One, of being stood back from, looked at in awe of, felt in fear
 of, that he could have smashed more than a table.


 Edith said, ""Hank!""


 He said, voice hoarse, ""Shut up. Go away. Let me eat alone. I'm sick of
 the lot of you.""
Mother and Joe returned a few minutes later where he sat forcing food
 down his throat. Mother said, ""Henry dear—"" He didn't answer. She began
 to cry, and he was glad she left the house then. He had never said
 anything really bad to his mother. He was afraid this would have been
 the time. Joe merely cleared his throat and mumbled something about
 getting together again soon and ""drop out and see the new development""
 and he, too, was gone. Lucille never did manage to speak to him.


 He finished his beef and waited. Soon Edith came in with the special
 dessert she'd been preparing half the day—a magnificent English trifle.
 She served him, and spooned out a portion for herself and Ralphie. She
 hesitated near his chair, and when he made no comment she called the
 boy. Then the three of them were sitting, facing the empty side of the
 table. They ate the trifle. Ralphie finished first and got up and said,
 ""Hey, I promised—""


 ""You promised the boys you'd play baseball or football or handball or
 something; anything to get away from your father.""


 Ralphie's head dropped and he muttered, ""Aw, no, Dad.""


 Edith said, ""He'll stay home, Hank. We'll spend an evening
 together—talking, watching TV, playing Monopoly.""


 Ralphie said, ""Gee, sure, Dad, if you want to.""


 Hank stood up. ""The question is not whether I want to. You both know I
 want to. The question is whether
you
want to.""


 They answered together that of course they wanted to. But their
 eyes—his wife's and son's eyes—could not meet his, and so he said he
 was going to his room because he was, after all, very tired and would in
 all probability continue to be very tired for a long, long time and that
 they shouldn't count on him for normal social life.


 He fell asleep quickly, lying there in his clothes.


 But he didn't sleep long. Edith shook him and he opened his eyes to a
 lighted room. ""Phil and Rhona are here."" He blinked at her. She smiled,
 and it seemed her old smile. ""They're so anxious to see you, Hank. I
 could barely keep Phil from coming up and waking you himself. They want
 to go out and do the town. Please, Hank, say you will.""


 He sat up. ""Phil,"" he muttered. ""Phil and Rhona."" They'd had wonderful
 times together, from grammar school on. Phil and Rhona, their oldest and
 closest friends. Perhaps this would begin his real homecoming.


 Do the town? They'd paint it and then tear it down!
It didn't turn out that way. He was disappointed; but then again, he'd
 also expected it. This entire first day at home had conditioned him to
 expect nothing good. They went to the bowling alleys, and Phil sounded
 very much the way he always had—soft spoken and full of laughter and
 full of jokes. He patted Edith on the head the way he always had, and
 clapped Hank on the shoulder (but not the way he always had—so much
 more gently, almost remotely), and insisted they all drink more than was
 good for them as he always had. And for once, Hank was ready to go along
 on the drinking. For once, he matched Phil shot for shot, beer for beer.


 They didn't bowl very long. At ten o'clock they crossed the road to
 Manfred's Tavern, where Phil and the girls ordered sandwiches and coffee
 and Hank went right on drinking. Edith said something to him, but he
 merely smiled and waved his hand and gulped another ounce of nirvana.


 There was dancing to a juke box in Manfred's Tavern. He'd been there
 many times before, and he was sure several of the couples recognized
 him. But except for a few abortive glances in his direction, it was as
 if he were a stranger in a city halfway around the world.


 At midnight, he was still drinking. The others wanted to leave, but he
 said, ""I haven't danced with my girl Rhona."" His tongue was thick, his
 mind was blurred, and yet he could read the strange expression on her
 face—pretty Rhona, who'd always flirted with him, who'd made a ritual
 of flirting with him. Pretty Rhona, who now looked as if she were going
 to be sick.


 ""So let's rock,"" he said and stood up.


 They were on the dance floor. He held her close, and hummed and chatted.
 And through the alcoholic haze saw she was a stiff-smiled, stiff-bodied,
 mechanical dancing doll.


 The number finished; they walked back to the booth. Phil said,
 ""Beddy-bye time.""


 Hank said, ""First one dance with my loving wife.""


 He and Edith danced. He didn't hold her close as he had Rhona. He waited
 for her to come close on her own, and she did, and yet she didn't.
 Because while she put herself against him, there was something in her
 face—no, in her eyes; it always showed in the eyes—that made him know
 she was trying to be the old Edith and not succeeding. This time when
 the music ended, he was ready to go home.


 They rode back to town along Route Nine, he and Edith in the rear of
 Phil's car, Rhona driving because Phil had drunk just a little too much,
 Phil singing and telling an occasional bad joke, and somehow not his old
 self. No one was his old self. No one would ever be his old self with
 the First One.


 They turned left, to take the short cut along Hallowed Hill Road, and
 Phil finished a story about a Martian and a Hollywood sex queen and
 looked at his wife and then past her at the long, cast-iron fence
 paralleling the road. ""Hey,"" he said, pointing, ""do you know why that's
 the most popular place on earth?""


 Rhona glanced to the left, and so did Hank and Edith. Rhona made a
 little sound, and Edith seemed to stop breathing, but Phil went on a
 while longer, not yet aware of his supposed
faux pas
.


 ""You know why?"" he repeated, turning to the back seat, the laughter
 rumbling up from his chest. ""You know why, folks?""


 Rhona said, ""Did you notice Carl Braken and his wife at—""


 Hank said, ""No, Phil, why is it the most popular place on earth?""


 Phil said, ""Because people are—"" And then he caught himself and waved
 his hand and muttered, ""I forgot the punch line.""


 ""Because people are dying to get in,"" Hank said, and looked through the
 window, past the iron fence, into the large cemetery at the fleeting
 tombstones.


 The car was filled with horrified silence when there should have been
 nothing but laughter, or irritation at a too-old joke. ""Maybe you should
 let me out right here,"" Hank said. ""I'm home—or that's what everyone
 seems to think. Maybe I should lie down in an open grave. Maybe that
 would satisfy people. Maybe that's the only way to act, like Dracula or
 another monster from the movies.""


 Edith said, ""Oh, Hank, don't, don't!""


 The car raced along the road, crossed a macadam highway, went four
 blocks and pulled to a stop. He didn't bother saying good night. He
 didn't wait for Edith. He just got out and walked up the flagstone path
 and entered the house.
""Hank,"" Edith whispered from the guest room doorway, ""I'm so sorry—""


 ""There's nothing to be sorry about. It's just a matter of time. It'll
 all work out in time.""


 ""Yes,"" she said quickly, ""that's it. I need a little time. We all need a
 little time. Because it's so strange, Hank. Because it's so frightening.
 I should have told you that the moment you walked in. I think I've hurt
 you terribly, we've all hurt you terribly, by trying to hide that we're
 frightened.""


 ""I'm going to stay in the guest room,"" he said, ""for as long as
 necessary. For good if need be.""


 ""How could it be for good? How, Hank?""


 That question was perhaps the first firm basis for hope he'd had since
 returning. And there was something else; what Carlisle had told him,
 even as Carlisle himself had reacted as all men did.


 ""There are others coming, Edith. Eight that I know of in the tanks right
 now. My superior, Captain Davidson, who died at the same moment I
 did—seven months ago next Wednesday—he's going to be next. He was
 smashed up worse than I was, so it took a little longer, but he's almost
 ready. And there'll be many more, Edith. The government is going to save
 all they possibly can from now on. Every time a young and healthy man
 loses his life by accident, by violence, and his body can be recovered,
 he'll go into the tanks and they'll start the regenerative brain and
 organ process—the process that made it all possible. So people have to
 get used to us. And the old stories, the old terrors, the ugly old
 superstitions have to die, because in time each place will have some of
 us; because in time it'll be an ordinary thing.""


 Edith said, ""Yes, and I'm so grateful that you're here, Hank. Please
 believe that. Please be patient with me and Ralphie and—"" She paused.
 ""There's one question.""


 He knew what the question was. It had been the first asked him by
 everyone from the president of the United States on down.


 ""I saw nothing,"" he said. ""It was as if I slept those six and a half
 months—slept without dreaming.""


 She came to him and touched his face with her lips, and he was
 satisfied.


 Later, half asleep, he heard a dog howling, and remembered stories of
 how they announced death and the presence of monsters. He shivered and
 pulled the covers closer to him and luxuriated in being safe in his own
 home.

There is one fact no sane man can quarrel

 with ... everything has a beginning and an end.

 But some men aren't sane; thus it isn't always so!
No, you're wrong. I'm not your father's ghost, even if I do look a bit
 like him. But it's a longish story, and you might as well let me in.
 You will, you know, so why quibble about it? At least, you always
 have ... or do ... or will. I don't know, verbs get all mixed up. We
 don't have the right attitude toward tenses for a situation like this.


 Anyhow, you'll let me in. I did, so you will.


 Thanks. You think you're crazy, of course, but you'll find out you
 aren't. It's just that things are a bit confused. And don't look at the
 machine out there too long—until you get used to it, you'll find it's
 hard on the eyes, trying to follow where the vanes go. You'll get used
 to it, of course, but it will take about thirty years.


 You're wondering whether to give me a drink, as I remember it. Why not?
 And naturally, since we have the same tastes, you can make the same for
 me as you're having. Of course we have the same tastes—we're the same
 person. I'm you thirty years from now, or you're me. I remember just
 how you feel; I felt the same way when he—that is, of course, I or
 we—came back to tell me about it, thirty years ago.


 Here, have one of these. You'll get to like them in a couple more
 years. And you can look at the revenue stamp date, if you still doubt
 my story. You'll believe it eventually, though, so it doesn't matter.


 Right now, you're shocked. It's a real wrench when a man meets himself
 for the first time. Some kind of telepathy seems to work between two
 of the same people. You
sense
things. So I'll simply go ahead talking
 for half an hour or so, until you get over it. After that you'll come
 along with me. You know, I could try to change things around by telling
 what happened to me; but he—I—told me what I was going to do, so I
 might as well do the same. I probably couldn't help telling you the
 same thing in the same words, even if I tried—and I don't intend to
 try. I've gotten past that stage in worrying about all this.


 So let's begin when you get up in half an hour and come out with me.
 You'll take a closer look at the machine, then. Yes, it'll be pretty
 obvious it must be a time machine. You'll sense that, too. You've seen
 it, just a small little cage with two seats, a luggage compartment, and
 a few buttons on a dash. You'll be puzzling over what I'll tell you,
 and you'll be getting used to the idea that you are the man who makes
 atomic power practical. Jerome Boell, just a plain engineer, the man
 who put atomic power in every home. You won't exactly believe it, but
 you'll want to go along.
I'll be tired of talking by then, and in a hurry to get going. So I
 cut off your questions, and get you inside. I snap on a green button,
 and everything seems to cut off around us. You can see a sort of
 foggy nothing surrounding the cockpit; it is probably the field that
 prevents passage through time from affecting us. The luggage section
 isn't protected, though.
You start to say something, but by then I'm pressing a black button,
 and everything outside will disappear. You look for your house, but
 it isn't there. There is exactly nothing there—in fact, there is no
there
. You are completely outside of time and space, as best you can
 guess how things are.


 You can't feel any motion, of course. You try to reach a hand out
 through the field into the nothing around you and your hand goes out,
 all right, but nothing happens. Where the screen ends, your hand just
 turns over and pokes back at you. Doesn't hurt, and when you pull your
 arm back, you're still sound and uninjured. But it looks frightening
 and you don't try it again.


 Then it comes to you slowly that you're actually traveling in time.
 You turn to me, getting used to the idea. ""So this is the fourth
 dimension?"" you ask.


 Then you feel silly, because you'll remember that I said you'd ask
 that. Well, I asked it after I was told, then I came back and told it
 to you, and I still can't help answering when you speak.


 ""Not exactly,"" I try to explain. ""Maybe it's no dimension—or it might
 be the fifth; if you're going to skip over the so-called fourth without
 traveling along it, you'd need a fifth. Don't ask me. I didn't invent
 the machine and I don't understand it.""


 ""But....""


 I let it go, and so do you. If you don't, it's a good way of going
 crazy. You'll see later why I couldn't have invented the machine. Of
 course, there may have been a start for all this once. There may have
 been a time when you did invent the machine—the atomic motor first,
 then the time-machine. And when you closed the loop by going back and
 saving yourself the trouble, it got all tangled up. I figured out once
 that such a universe would need some seven or eight time and space
 dimensions. It's simpler just to figure that this is the way time got
 bent back on itself. Maybe there is no machine, and it's just easier
 for us to imagine it. When you spend thirty years thinking about it, as
 I did—and you will—you get further and further from an answer.


 Anyhow, you sit there, watching nothing all around you, and no time,
 apparently, though there is a time effect back in the luggage space.
 You look at your watch and it's still running. That means you either
 carry a small time field with you, or you are catching a small
 increment of time from the main field. I don't know, and you won't
 think about that then, either.
I'm smoking, and so are you, and the air in the machine is getting a
 bit stale. You suddenly realize that everything in the machine is wide
 open, yet you haven't seen any effects of air loss.


 ""Where are we getting our air?"" you ask. ""Or why don't we lose it?""


 ""No place for it to go,"" I explain. There isn't. Out there is neither
 time nor space, apparently. How could the air leak out? You still feel
 gravity, but I can't explain that, either. Maybe the machine has a
 gravity field built in, or maybe the time that makes your watch run is
 responsible for gravity. In spite of Einstein, you have always had the
 idea that time is an effect of gravity, and I sort of agree, still.


 Then the machine stops—at least, the field around us cuts off. You
 feel a dankish sort of air replace the stale air, and you breathe
 easier, though we're in complete darkness, except for the weak light in
 the machine, which always burns, and a few feet of rough dirty cement
 floor around. You take another cigaret from me and you get out of the
 machine, just as I do.


 I've got a bundle of clothes and I start changing. It's a sort
 of simple, short-limbed, one-piece affair I put on, but it feels
 comfortable.


 ""I'm staying here,"" I tell you. ""This is like the things they wear in
 this century, as near as I can remember it, and I should be able to
 pass fairly well. I've had all my fortune—the one you make on that
 atomic generator—invested in such a way I can get it on using some
 identification I've got with me, so I'll do all right. I know they
 still use some kind of money, you'll see evidence of that. And it's a
 pretty easygoing civilization, from what I could see. We'll go up and
 I'll leave you. I like the looks of things here, so I won't be coming
 back with you.""


 You nod, remembering I've told you about it. ""What century is this,
 anyway?""


 I'd told you that, too, but you've forgotten. ""As near as I can guess,
 it's about 2150. He told me, just as I'm telling you, that it's an
 interstellar civilization.""


 You take another cigaret from me, and follow me. I've got a small
 flashlight and we grope through a pile of rubbish, out into a corridor.
 This is a sub-sub-sub-basement. We have to walk up a flight of stairs,
 and there is an elevator waiting, fortunately with the door open.


 ""What about the time machine?"" you ask.


 ""Since nobody ever stole it, it's safe.""
We get in the elevator, and I say ""first"" to it. It gives out a
 coughing noise and the basement openings begin to click by us. There's
 no feeling of acceleration—some kind of false gravity they use in the
 future. Then the door opens, and the elevator says ""first"" back at us.


 It's obviously a service elevator and we're in a dim corridor, with
 nobody around. I grab your hand and shake it. ""You go that way. Don't
 worry about getting lost; you never did, so you can't. Find the museum,
 grab the motor, and get out. And good luck to you.""


 You act as if you're dreaming, though you can't believe it's a dream.
 You nod at me and I move out into the main corridor. A second later,
 you see me going by, mixed into a crowd that is loafing along toward
 a restaurant, or something like it, that is just opening. I'm asking
 questions of a man, who points, and I turn and move off.


 You come out of the side corridor and go down a hall, away from the
 restaurant. There are quiet little signs along the hall. You look at
 them, realizing for the first time that things have changed.
Steij:neri, Faunten, Z:rgat Dispenseri.
The signs are very quiet and
 dignified. Some of them can be decoded to stationery shops, fountains,
 and the like. What a zergot is, you don't know. You stop at a sign
 that announces:
Trav:l Biwrou—F:rst-Clas Twrz—Marz, Viin*s, and
 x: Trouj:n Planets. Spej:l reits tu aol s*nz wixin 60 lyt iirz!
But
 there is only a single picture of a dull-looking metal sphere, with
 passengers moving up a ramp, and the office is closed. You begin to get
 the hang of the spelling they use, though.


 Now there are people around you, but nobody pays much attention to you.
 Why should they? You wouldn't care if you saw a man in a leopard-skin
 suit; you'd figure it was some part in a play and let it go. Well,
 people don't change much.


 You get up your courage and go up to a boy selling something that might
 be papers on tapes.


 ""Where can I find the Museum of Science?""


 ""Downayer rien turn lefa the sign. Stoo bloss,"" he tells you. Around
 you, you hear some pretty normal English, but there are others using
 stuff as garbled as his. The educated and uneducated? I don't know.


 You go right until you find a big sign built into the rubbery surface
 of the walk:
Miuzi:m *v Syens
. There's an arrow pointing and you turn
 left. Ahead of you, two blocks on, you can see a pink building, with
 faint aqua trimming, bigger than most of the others. They are building
 lower than they used to, apparently. Twenty floors up seems about the
 maximum. You head for it, and find the sidewalk is marked with the
 information that it is the museum.
You go up the steps, but you see that it seems to be closed. You
 hesitate for a moment, then. You're beginning to think the whole affair
 is complete nonsense, and you should get back to the time machine and
 go home. But then a guard comes to the gate. Except for the short legs
 in his suit and the friendly grin on his face, he looks like any other
 guard.


 What's more, he speaks pretty clearly. Everyone says things in a sort
 of drawl, with softer vowels and slurred consonants, but it's rather
 pleasant.


 ""Help you, sir? Oh, of course. You must be playing in 'Atoms and
 Axioms.' The museum's closed, but I'll be glad to let you study
 whatever you need for realism in your role. Nice show. I saw it twice.""


 ""Thanks,"" you mutter, wondering what kind of civilization can produce
 guards as polite as that. ""I—I'm told I should investigate your
 display of atomic generators.""


 He beams at that. ""Of course."" The gate is swung to behind you, but
 obviously he isn't locking it. In fact, there doesn't seem to be a
 lock. ""Must be a new part. You go down that corridor, up one flight
 of stairs and left. Finest display in all the known worlds. We've got
 the original of the first thirteen models. Professor Jonas was using
 them to check his latest theory of how they work. Too bad he could
 not explain the principle, either. Someone will, some day, though.
 Lord, the genius of that twentieth century inventor! It's quite a
 hobby with me, sir. I've read everything I could get on the period.
 Oh—congratulations on your pronunciation. Sounds just like some of our
 oldest tapes.""


 You get away from him, finally, after some polite thanks. The building
 seems deserted and you wander up the stairs. There's a room on your
 right filled with something that proclaims itself the first truly
 plastic diamond former, and you go up to it. As you come near, it
 goes through a crazy wiggle inside, stops turning out a continual row
 of what seem to be bearings, and slips something the size of a penny
 toward you.


 ""Souvenir,"" it announces in a well-modulated voice. ""This is a typical
 gem of the twentieth century, properly cut to 58 facets, known
 technically as a Jaegger diamond, and approximately twenty carats
 in size. You can have it made into a ring on the third floor during
 morning hours for one-tenth credit. If you have more than one child,
 press the red button for the number of stones you desire.""


 You put it in your pocket, gulping a little, and get back to the
 corridor. You turn left and go past a big room in which models of
 spaceships—from the original thing that looks like a V-2, and is
 labeled first Lunar rocket, to a ten-foot globe, complete with
 miniature manikins—are sailing about in some kind of orbits. Then
 there is one labeled
Wep:nz
, filled with everything from a crossbow
 to a tiny rod four inches long and half the thickness of a pencil,
 marked
Fynal Hand Arm
. Beyond is the end of the corridor, and a big
 place that bears a sign,
Mad:lz *v Atamic Pau:r Sorsez
.
By that time, you're almost convinced. And you've been doing a lot of
 thinking about what you can do. The story I'm telling has been sinking
 in, but you aren't completely willing to accept it.


 You notice that the models are all mounted on tables and that they're a
 lot smaller than you thought. They seem to be in chronological order,
 and the latest one, marked
2147—Rincs Dyn*pat:
, is about the size
 of a desk telephone. The earlier ones are larger, of course, clumsier,
 but with variations, probably depending on the power output. A big sign
 on the ceiling gives a lot of dope on atomic generators, explaining
 that this is the first invention which leaped full blown into basically
 final form.


 You study it, but it mentions casually the inventor, without giving
 his name. Either they don't know it, or they take it for granted that
 everyone does, which seems more probable. They call attention to the
 fact that they have the original model of the first atomic generator
 built, complete with design drawings, original manuscript on operation,
 and full patent application.


 They state that it has all major refinements, operating on any fuel,
 producing electricity at any desired voltage up to five million, any
 chosen cyclic rate from direct current to one thousand megacycles,
 and any amperage up to one thousand, its maximum power output being
 fifty kilowatts, limited by the current-carrying capacity of the
 outputs. They also mention that the operating principle is still being
 investigated, and that only such refinements as better alloys and the
 addition of magnetric and nucleatric current outlets have been added
 since the original.


 So you go to the end and look over the thing. It's simply a square box
 with a huge plug on each side, and a set of vernier controls on top,
 plus a little hole marked, in old-style spelling,
Drop BBs or wire
 here
. Apparently that's the way it's fueled. It's about one foot on
 each side.


 ""Nice,"" the guard says over your shoulder. ""It finally wore out one of
 the cathogrids and we had to replace that, but otherwise it's exactly
 as the great inventor made it. And it still operates as well as ever.
 Like to have me tell you about it?""


 ""Not particularly,"" you begin, and then realize bad manners might be
 conspicuous here. While you're searching for an answer, the guard pulls
 something out of his pocket and stares at it.


 ""Fine, fine. The mayor of Altasecarba—Centaurian, you know—is
 arriving, but I'll be back in about ten minutes. He wants to examine
 some of the weapons for a monograph on Centaurian primitives compared
 to nineteenth century man. You'll pardon me?""


 You pardon him pretty eagerly and he wanders off happily. You go up
 to the head of the line, to that Rinks Dynapattuh, or whatever it
 transliterates to. That's small and you can carry it. But the darned
 thing is absolutely fixed. You can't see any bolts, but you can't budge
 it, either.
You work down the line. It'd be foolish to take the early model if you
 can get one with built-in magnetic current terminals—Ehrenhaft or
 some other principle?—and nuclear binding-force energy terminals. But
 they're all held down by the same whatchamaycallem effect.


 And, finally, you're right back beside the original first model. It's
 probably bolted down, too, but you try it tentatively and you find it
 moves. There's a little sign under it, indicating you shouldn't touch
 it, since the gravostatic plate is being renewed.


 Well, you won't be able to change the time cycle by doing anything I
 haven't told you, but a working model such as that is a handy thing.
 You lift it; it only weighs about fifty pounds! Naturally, it can be
 carried.


 You expect a warning bell, but nothing happens. As a matter of fact,
 if you'd stop drinking so much of that scotch and staring at the time
 machine out there now, you'd hear what I'm saying and know what will
 happen to you. But of course, just as I did, you're going to miss a
 lot of what I say from now on, and have to find out for yourself. But
 maybe some of it helps. I've tried to remember how much I remembered,
 after he told me, but I can't be sure. So I'll keep on talking. I
 probably can't help it, anyhow. Pre-set, you might say.


 Well, you stagger down the corridor, looking out for the guard, but all
 seems clear. Then you hear his voice from the weapons room. You bend
 down and try to scurry past, but you know you're in full view. Nothing
 happens, though.


 You stumble down the stairs, feeling all the futuristic rays in the
 world on your back, and still nothing happens. Ahead of you, the gate
 is closed. You reach it and it opens obligingly by itself. You breathe
 a quick sigh of relief and start out onto the street.


 Then there's a yell behind you. You don't wait. You put one leg in
 front of the other and you begin racing down the walk, ducking past
 people, who stare at you with expressions you haven't time to see.
 There's another yell behind you.


 Something goes over your head and drops on the sidewalk just in front
 of your feet, with a sudden ringing sound. You don't wait to find out
 about that, either. Somebody reaches out a hand to catch you and you
 dart past.
The street is pretty clear now and you jolt along, with your arms
 seeming to come out of the sockets, and that atomic generator getting
 heavier at every step.


 Out of nowhere, something in a blue uniform about six feet tall and
 on the beefy side appears—and the badge hasn't changed much. The cop
 catches your arm and you know you're not going to get away, so you stop.


 ""You can't exert yourself that hard in this heat, fellow,"" the cop
 says. ""There are laws against that, without a yellow sticker. Here, let
 me grab you a taxi.""
Reaction sets in a bit and your knees begin to buckle, but you shake
 your head and come up for air.


 ""I—I left my money home,"" you begin.


 The cop nods. ""Oh, that explains it. Fine, I won't have to give you
 an appearance schedule. But you should have come to me."" He reaches
 out and taps a pedestrian lightly on the shoulder. ""Sir, an emergency
 request. Would you help this gentleman?""
The pedestrian grins, looks at his watch, and nods. ""How far?""


 You did notice the name of the building from which you came and you
 mutter it. The stranger nods again, reaches out and picks up the other
 side of the generator, blowing a little whistle the cop hands him.
 Pedestrians begin to move aside, and you and the stranger jog down the
 street at a trot, with a nice clear path, while the cop stands beaming
 at you both.


 That way, it isn't so bad. And you begin to see why I decided I might
 like to stay in the future. But all the same, the organized cooperation
 here doesn't look too good. The guard can get the same and be there
 before you.


 And he is. He stands just inside the door of the building as you reach
 it. The stranger lifts an eyebrow and goes off at once when you nod
 at him, not waiting for thanks. And the guard comes up, holding some
 dinkus in his hand, about the size of a big folding camera and not too
 dissimilar in other ways. He snaps it open and you get set to duck.


 ""You forgot the prints, monograph, and patent applications,"" he says.
 ""They go with the generator—we don't like to have them separated. A
 good thing I knew the production office of 'Atoms and Axioms' was in
 this building. Just let us know when you're finished with the model and
 we'll pick it up.""


 You swallow several sets of tonsils you had removed years before, and
 take the bundle of papers he hands you out of the little case. He pumps
 you for some more information, which you give him at random. It seems
 to satisfy your amiable guard friend. He finally smiles in satisfaction
 and heads back to the museum.


 You still don't believe it, but you pick up the atomic generator and
 the information sheets, and you head down toward the service elevator.
 There is no button on it. In fact, there's no door there.


 You start looking for other doors or corridors, but you know this is
 right. The signs along the halls are the same as they were.
Then there's a sort of cough and something dilates in the wall. It
 forms a perfect door and the elevator stands there waiting. You get in,
 gulping out something about going all the way down, and then wonder how
 a machine geared for voice operation can make anything of that. What
 the deuce would that lowest basement be called? But the elevator has
 closed and is moving downward in a hurry. It coughs again and you're at
 the original level. You get out—and realize you don't have a light.


 You'll never know what you stumbled over, but, somehow, you move back
 in the direction of the time machine, bumping against boxes, staggering
 here and there, and trying to find the right place by sheer feel. Then
 a shred of dim light appears; it's the weak light in the time machine.


 You've located it.


 You put the atomic generator in the luggage space, throw the papers
 down beside it, and climb into the cockpit, sweating and mumbling. You
 reach forward toward the green button and hesitate. There's a red one
 beside it and you finally decide on that.


 Suddenly, there's a confused yell from the direction of the elevator
 and a beam of light strikes against your eyes, with a shout punctuating
 it. Your finger touches the red button.


 You'll never know what the shouting was about—whether they finally
 doped out the fact that they'd been robbed, or whether they were trying
 to help you. You don't care which it is. The field springs up around
 you and the next button you touch—the one on the board that hasn't
 been used so far—sends you off into nothingness. There is no beam of
 light, you can't hear a thing, and you're safe.


 It isn't much of a trip back. You sit there smoking and letting your
 nerves settle back to normal. You notice a third set of buttons, with
 some pencil marks over them—""Press these to return to yourself 30
 years""—and you begin waiting for the air to get stale. It doesn't
 because there is only one of you this time.


 Instead, everything flashes off and you're sitting in the machine in
 your own back yard.


 You'll figure out the cycle in more details later. You get into the
 machine in front of your house, go to the future in the sub-basement,
 land in your back yard, and then hop back thirty years to pick up
 yourself, landing in front of your house. Just that. But right then,
 you don't care. You jump out and start pulling out that atomic
 generator and taking it inside.
It isn't hard to disassemble, but you don't learn a thing; just some
 plates of metal, some spiral coils, and a few odds and ends—all
 things that can be made easily enough, all obviously of common metals.
 But when you put it together again, about an hour later, you notice
 something.


 Everything in it is brand-new and there's one set of copper wires
 missing! It won't work. You put some #12 house wire in, exactly like
 the set on the other side, drop in some iron filings, and try it again.


 And with the controls set at 120 volts, 60 cycles and 15 amperes, you
 get just that. You don't need the power company any more. And you
 feel a little happier when you realize that the luggage space wasn't
 insulated from time effects by a field, so the motor has moved backward
 in time, somehow, and is back to its original youth—minus the
 replaced wires the guard mentioned—which probably wore out because of
 the makeshift job you've just done.


 But you begin getting more of a jolt when you find that the papers are
 all in your own writing, that your name is down as the inventor, and
 that the date of the patent application is 1951.


 It will begin to soak in, then. You pick up an atomic generator in the
 future and bring it back to the past—your present—so that it can be
 put in the museum with you as the inventor so you can steal it to be
 the inventor. And you do it in a time machine which you bring back to
 yourself to take yourself into the future to return to take back to
 yourself....


 Who invented what? And who built which?


 Before long, your riches from the generator are piling in. Little
 kids from school are coming around to stare at the man who changed
 history and made atomic power so common that no nation could hope to
 be anything but a democracy and a peaceful one—after some of the
 worst times in history for a few years. Your name eventually becomes as
 common as Ampere, or Faraday, or any other spelled without a capital
 letter.


 But you're thinking of the puzzle. You can't find any answer.


 One day you come across an old poem—something about some folks

Sure I'm a Nilly, and I've died seven times, always in the blackness
 of the outer reaches, and I'm not alone, although there aren't very
 many of us, never were.
It made sense. Interstellar was new and they wanted him on the ship
 because he was a trained observer. They wanted facts, not gibberish.
 But to ask a man to give up two years of his life—well, that was
 asking a lot. Two years in a sardine can. Still, it had an appeal Keith
 Ellason knew he couldn't deny, a newsman's joy of the clean beat, a
 planetary system far afield, a closeup view of the universe, history in
 the making.


 Interstellar Chief Rexroad knocked the dottle from his pipe in a tray,
 saying, ""Transworld Press is willing to let you have a leave of
 abscence, if you're interested.""


 He knew Secretary Phipps from years of contacting, and now Phipps said,
 ""Personally, I don't want to see anybody else on the job. You've got a
 fine record in this sort of thing.""


 Keith Ellason smiled, but just barely. ""You should have called me for
 the first trip.""


 Phipps nodded. ""I wish we had had you on the
Weblor I
.""


 ""Crewmen,"" Rexroad said, ""make poor reporters.""


 The
Weblor I
had taken off on the first trip to Antheon five years
 before with a thousand families, reached the planet with less than five
 hundred surviving colonists. Upon the return to Earth a year later, the
 crew's report of suffering and chaos during the year's outgoing voyage
 was twisted, distorted and fragmentary. Ellason remembered it well. The
 decision of Interstellar was that the colonists started a revolution
 far out in space, that it was fanned by the ignorance of Captain
 Sessions in dealing with such matters.


 ""Space affects men in a peculiar way,"" Phipps said. ""We have conquered
 the problem of small groups in space—witness the discovery of
 Antheon, for example—but when there are large groups, control is more
 difficult.""


 ""Sessions,"" Rexroad said, ""was a bully. The trouble started at about
 the halfway point. It ended with passengers engaging in open warfare
 with each other and the crew. Sessions was lucky to escape with his
 life.""


 ""As I recall,"" Ellason said, ""there was something about stunners.""


 Phipps rubbed his chin. ""No weapons were allowed on the ship, but you
 must remember the colonists were selected for their intelligence and
 resourcefulness. They utilized these attributes to set up weapon shops
 to arm themselves.""


 ""The second trip is history,"" Rexroad said. ""And a puzzle.""
Ellason nodded. ""The ship disappeared.""


 ""Yes. We gave control to the colonists.""


 ""Assuming no accident in space,"" Phipps said, ""it was a wrong decision.
 They probably took over the ship.""


 ""And now,"" Ellason said, ""you're going to try again.""


 Rexroad said very gravely, ""We've got the finest captain in
 Interplanetary. Harvey Branson. No doubt you've heard of him. He's
 spent his life in our own system, and he's handpicking his own crew. We
 have also raised prerequisites for applicants. We don't think anything
 is going to happen, but if it does, we want to get an impersonal,
 unprejudiced view. That's where you come in. You do the observing, the
 reporting. We'll evaluate it on your return.""


 ""If I return,"" said Ellason.


 ""I suppose that's problematical,"" Phipps said, ""but I think you will.
 Captain Branson and his fifty crewmen want to return as badly as you
 do."" He grinned. ""You can write that novel you're always talking about
 on your return trip on the
Weblor II
.""
Being a Nilly is important, probably as important as running the ship,
 and I think it is this thought that keeps us satisfied, willing to be
 what we are.
The
Weblor II
had been built in space, as had its predecessor, the
Weblor I
, at a tremendous cost. Basically, it was an instrument
 which would open distant vistas to colonization, reducing the
 shoulder-to-shoulder pressure of a crowded solar system. A gigantic,
 hollow spike, the ship would never land anywhere, but would circle
 Antheon as it circled Earth, shuttling its cargo and passengers to the
 promised land, the new frontier. A space-borne metropolis, it would
 be the home for three thousand persons outward bound, only the crew
 on the return trip. It was equipped with every conceivable facility
 and comfort—dining rooms, assembly hall, individual and family
 compartments, recreation areas, swimming pool, library, theater.
 Nothing had been overlooked.


 The captain's briefing room was crowded, the air was heavy with the
 breathing of so many men, and the ventilators could not quite clear the
 air of tobacco smoke that drifted aimlessly here and there before it
 was caught and whisked away.


 In the tradition of newspaperman and observer, Keith Ellason tried
 to be as inconspicuous as possible, pressing against a bulkhead, but
 Captain Branson's eyes sought his several times as Branson listened
 to final reports from his engineers, record keepers, fuel men,
 computermen, and all the rest. He grunted his approval or disapproval,
 made a suggestion here, a restriction there. There was no doubt that
 Branson was in charge, yet there was a human quality about him that
 Ellason liked. The captain's was a lean face, well tanned, and his eyes
 were chunks of blue.


 ""Gentlemen,"" Branson said at last, as Ellason knew he would, ""I want
 to introduce Keith Ellason, whose presence Interstellar has impressed
 upon us. On loan from Transworld, he will have an observer status."" He
 introduced him to the others. All of them seemed friendly; Ellason
 thought it was a good staff.


 Branson detained him after the others had gone. ""One thing, Mr.
 Ellason. To make it easier for you, I suggest you think of this journey
 strictly from the observer viewpoint. There will be no story for
 Transworld at the end.""


 Ellason was startled. While he had considered the possibility, he had
 not dwelt on it. Now it loomed large in his mind. ""I don't understand,
 Captain Branson. It seems to me—""


 ""Let me put it differently. Let me say that you will not understand why
 I say that until the journey ends."" He smiled. ""Perhaps I shouldn't
 have mentioned it.""
Ellason left the captain's quarters with an odd taste in his mouth. Now
 why had Branson said that? Why hadn't Rexroad or Phipps said something,
 if it was important?


 He made himself comfortable in his seven-foot-by-seven-foot cubicle,
 which is to say he dropped on his bed, found it more comfortable than
 he thought it would be, put his arms behind his head, stared at the
 ceiling. Metal walls, no windows, one floor vent, one ceiling vent,
 and a solitary ceiling molding tube-light. This would be his home for
 a year, just as there were homes like it for three thousand others,
 except that the family rooms would be larger. His quarters were near
 the front of the spike near the officers' quarters.


 He felt rather than heard the dull rumble. It was a sound he knew would
 be with him for two years—one year going and one year returning.


 He looked at his watch, picked up his notebook and made an entry. The
 ship right now would be slipping ever so slowly away from Earth. He got
 up. He'd have to go forward to the observation dome to see that. Last
 view of Earth for two years.
The penetration of space by large groups is the coming out from under
 the traditions of thousands of years, and as these planet-orginated
 rules fall away, the floundering group seeks a new control, for they
 are humanity adrift, rudderless, for whom the stars are no longer
 bearings but nonexistent things, and values are altered if they are not
 shown the way.
The theft of Carver Janssen's attache case occurred on the thirty-first
 day out. In Ellason's mind the incident, though insignificant from the
 standpoint of the ship as a whole, could very well be the cause of
 dissension later on. His notes covering it were therefore very thorough.


 Janssen's case contained vegetable and flower seeds—thousands of
 them, according to the Captain's Bulletin, the ship's daily newsletter
 which went to all hands and passengers. In the Bulletin the captain
 appealed to the thief to return the case to Mr. Janssen. He said it
 was significant that all en route had passed stability tests, and that
 it was to the ship's discredit that someone with criminal tendencies
 should have been permitted aboard.


 Ellason had to smile at that. What did Captain Branson think of those
 colonists who killed each other on the
Weblor I
? They had passed
 stability tests too. This, then, was what happened when you took three
 thousand strangers and stuck them in a can for a year.
When Ellason saw Branson about it, the captain said, ""Of course I
 realize it takes only a little thing like this to set things off. I
 know people get tired of seeing each other, playing the same tapes,
 looking at the stars from the observation dome, walking down the same
 corridors, reading the same books, eating the same meals, though God
 knows we try to vary it as much as we can. Space creates rough edges.
 But the point is, we know all this, and knowing it, we shouldn't let it
 happen. We've got to find that thief.""


 ""What would he want seeds for? Have you thought of that?""


 ""Of course. They'd have real value on Antheon.""


 Ellason sought out Carver Janssen. He was a middle-aged man with a
 tired face and sad eyes. He said, ""Now what am I going to Antheon
 for? I could only take along so much baggage and I threw out some
 comfort items to make room for the seeds. I'm a horticulturist, and
 Interstellar asked me to go along. But what use am I now? Where am
 I going to get seeds like those? Do you know how long it took me to
 collect them? They're not ordinary seeds, Mr. Ellason.""


 There was an appeal from Janssen in the next day's newsletter
 describing the seeds, telling of their value, and requesting their
 return in the interests of the Antheon colony and of humanity.


 On the thirty-fourth day a witness turned up who said he had seen a
 man emerging from Janssen's compartment with the black case. ""I didn't
 think anything of it at the time,"" Jamieson Dievers said.


 Branson asked him to describe the man.


 ""Oh, he was about six feet tall, stocky build, and he wore a red rubber
 mask that covered his head completely.""


 ""Didn't you think that was important?"" Branson asked in an outraged
 voice. ""A man wearing a red mask?""


 Dievers shrugged. ""This is a spaceship. How would I know whether a red
 mask—or a blue or green one—does or doesn't belong on a spaceship?""


 Although Dievers' account appeared in the newsletter, it was largely
 discounted.


 ""If it is true,"" Branson told Ellason, ""the theft must be the work of
 a psychotic. But I don't believe Jamieson Dievers. It may well be he's
 the psychotic."" He snorted. ""Red rubber mask! I think I'll have Dievers
 put through psychiatry.""


 Attendant to taking notes on this incident, Ellason noted a strange
 thing. Janssen lived in that part of the ship known as the First
 Quadrant, and those who lived in that quadrant—more than seven hundred
 men, women and children—felt that the thief must surely live in
 Quadrant Two or Four. Elias Cromley, who had the compartment next to
 Janssen's, sounded the consensus when he said, ""Surely a man wouldn't
 steal from his own quadrant, now would he, Mr. Ellason?""


 And so, Ellason observed in his notebook, are wars created.
Seen in space, stars are unmoving, silent, sterile bright eyes ever
 watchful and accusing. To men unused to it, such a sight numbs,
 compresses, stultifies. He introduces a countermeasure, proof he
 exists, which is any overt act, sometimes violent.
On the forty-fifth day June Failright, the young wife of one of the
 passenger meteorologists, ran screaming down one of the long corridors
 of the Third Quadrant. She told the captain she had been attacked in
 her compartment while her husband was in the ship's library. She was
 taken to one of the ship's doctors, who confirmed it.


 She said the culprit was a husky man wearing a red rubber mask, and
 though her description of what he had done did not appear in the story
 in the newsletter, it lost no time in penetrating every compartment of
 the ship.


 Ellason was present when a delegation from the Third Quadrant called on
 Captain Branson, demanding action.


 Branson remained seated behind his desk, unperturbed, saying, ""I have
 no crewmen to spare for police duty.""


 The delegation commenced speaking vehemently, to be quieted by
 Branson's raised hand.


 ""I sympathize,"" Branson said, ""but it is up to each quadrant to deal
 with its problems, whatever they may be. My job is to get us to
 Antheon.""


 The group left in a surly mood.


 ""You wonder at my reluctance, Mr. Ellason,"" Captain Branson said. ""But
 suppose I assign the crew to patrol duties, the culprit isn't caught,
 and further incidents occur. What then? It soon becomes the crew's
 fault. And soon the colonists will begin thinking these things might be
 the crew's doing in the first place.""


 ""Yes,"" Ellason said, ""but what if the intruder is a crewman?""


 ""I know my men,"" Branson said flatly.


 ""You could have a shake-down for the mask and the seed case.""


 ""Do you think it is a member of the crew?"" Branson's eyes were bright.
 ""No, I trust my men. I won't violate that trust.""


 Ellason left, feeling uneasy. If he were Branson, he'd initiate an
 investigation, if nothing else than to prove the crew guiltless. Why
 couldn't Branson see the wisdom of setting an example for the colonists?
As a Nilly, I knew that space breeds hate. There is a seed of
 malevolence in every man. It sometimes blossoms out among the stars. On
 the
Weblor II
it was ready for ripening.
Raymond Palugger was killed in the ship's hospital on the sixty-first
 day. Palugger, a Fourth Quadrant passenger, had complained of feeling
 ill, had been hospitalized with a diagnosis of ileus. He had put his
 money belt in the drawer of the small stand beside his bed. A man
 in a red mask was seen hurrying from the hospital area, and a staff
 investigation revealed that Palugger had died trying to prevent the
 theft of the belt.


 Captain Branson did not wait for the newsletter. Through the ship's
 speaker system, he reported that Palugger had a fortune in credits
 in the belt and had died of a severe beating. He said that since the
 incident occurred in the staff section of the ship, his crew would be
 forced to submit to a thorough inspection in an effort to find the
 mask, the seed case, the money and the man.


 ""I will not countenance such an act by a crewman,"" Branson said. ""If
 and when he is found, he will be severely dealt with. But he might not
 be a member of the crew. I am ordering an assembly of all passengers at
 nine tomorrow morning in the auditorium. I will speak to you all then.""
Faces were angry, tongues were sharp at the meeting, eyes suspicious
 and tempers short. Above it all was the overpowering presence of
 Captain Branson speaking to them.


 ""It is not my desire to interfere in passenger affairs,"" he said.
 ""Insofar as the ship is concerned, it is my duty to make certain no
 crewman is guilty. This I am doing. But my crew is not and cannot be
 a police force for you. It is up to you people to police and protect
 yourselves.""


 ""How can we protect ourselves without stunners?"" one colonist called
 out.


 ""Has Red Mask a gun?"" Branson retorted. ""It seems to me you have a
 better weapon than any gun.""


 ""What's that?""


 ""This ship is only so wide, so long and so deep. If every inch is
 searched, you'll find your man. He has to be somewhere aboard.""


 The colonists quieted. Benjamin Simpson, one of the older men, was
 elected president of the newly formed Quadrant Council. One man from
 each of the quadrants was named to serve under him. Each of these men
 in turn selected five others from his own group.


 Those assembled waited in the hall while each team of six inspected
 the compartments of the others. These compartments were then locked,
 everyone returned to his compartment, and the larger search was
 conducted. It took twenty hours.


 No mask was found. No mask, no case, no money, no man.


 The captain reported that his search had been equally fruitless.
 At another assembly the following day it was decided to make the
 inspection teams permanent, to await further moves on the part of Red
 Mask. The Quadrant Council held periodic meetings to set up a method of
 trial for him when he was caught. It was all recorded in the newsletter
 and by Keith Ellason.
We Nillys know about hate and about violence. We know too that where
 there is hate there is violence, and where there is violence there is
 death.
During sleep time on the seventy-ninth day Barbara Stoneman, awakened
 by a strange sound, sat up in the bed of her compartment to find a
 man in a red mask in her room. Her cries brought neighbors into the
 corridor. The flight of the man was witnessed by many, and several men
 tried to stop him. But the intruder was light on his feet and fast. He
 escaped.


 The Quadrant Council confronted the captain, demanding weapons.


 ""Are you out of your minds?"" Branson exclaimed.


 Tom Tilbury, Fourth Quadrant leader, said, ""We want to set up a police
 force, Captain. We want stunners.""


 ""There's no law against it,"" Branson said, ""but it's a rule of mine
 that no weapons are to be issued en route.""


 ""If we had had a gun, we'd have got Red Mask,"" Tilbury said.


 ""And I might have a murder on my conscience.""


 Tilbury said, ""We've also thought of that. Suppose you supply us with
 half-power stunners? That way we can stun but not kill.""


 They got their guns. Now there were twenty-four policemen on duty in
 the corridors—eight on at a time. Ellason observed that for the first
 time the passengers seemed relaxed.


 Let Red Mask move against armed men, they said.


 Yeah, let him see what happens now.


 Red Mask did.
On the 101st day he was seen in a corridor in Quadrant Four. Emil
 Pierce, policeman on duty, managed to squeeze off several shots at his
 retreating figure.


 Red Mask was seen again on the 120th day, on the 135th day, and the
 157th day. He was seen, shot at, but not hit. He was also unable to
 commit any crime.


 We've got him on the run, the colonists said.


 He's afraid to do anything, now that we've got police protection, they
 said smugly.


 The Quadrant Council congratulated itself. The passengers were proud
 of themselves. A special congratulatory message from Captain Branson
 appeared one day in the Bulletin newsletter.


 The colonists settled down to living out the rest of the voyage until
 the landing on Antheon.


 But on the 170th day calamity struck. Red Mask appropriated one of the
 stunners, made his way down one whole corridor section in Quadrant Two,
 put occupants to sleep as he went, taking many articles of value and
 leaving disorder behind.


 Ellason interviewed as many victims as he could, noted it all in
 his book. The things taken were keepsakes, photographs and items of
 personal value. It seemed to be the work of a madman. If Red Mask
 wanted to make everyone furious, he certainly succeeded.


 ""What does he want that stuff for?"" Casey Stromberg, a passenger
 doctor, asked. ""I can see him taking my narcotics, my doctor's kit—but
 my dead wife's picture? That I don't understand.""


 It was the same with others. ""The man's insane, Mr. Ellason. Positively
 insane."" Many people said it.


 The council issued orders that all passengers from now on would be
 required to lock their compartments at all times. More guns were
 obtained from the captain. More policemen were appointed.


 Ellason was busy noting it all in his book. It became filled with
 jottings about innocent people being accidentally stunned when
 trigger-happy policemen thought their movements suspicious, about one
 man's suspicion of another and the ensuing search of compartments,
 people who saw Red Mask here, saw him there. Hardly a day went by
 without some new development.


 ""Oh, yes, Mr. Ellason, we're going to get him,"" said Tilbury, now chief
 of police, cracking his knuckles, his eyes glowing at the thought.
 ""We're bound to get him. We've got things worked out to the finest
 detail. He won't be able to get through our fingers now. Just let him
 make so much as a move.""


 ""And what will you do when you get him?""


 ""Kill him,"" Tilbury said, licking his lips, his eyes glowing more
 fiercely than ever.


 ""Without a trial?""


 ""Oh, there'll be a trial, Mr. Ellason, but you don't think any jury'd
 let him live after all the things he's done, do you?""
Red Mask was stunned in Quadrant Four in a corridor by a policeman
 named Terryl Placer on the 201st day. The criminal was carried to the
 assembly room surrounded by guards, for he surely would have been
 mauled, if not killed, by angry colonists who crowded around. In the
 assembly hall his mask was whipped off. The crowd gasped. Nobody knew
 him.


 Ellason's first thought was that he must be a stowaway, but then he
 remembered the face, and Captain Branson, who came to have a look at
 him, unhappily admitted the man was a member of the crew. His name was
 Harrel Critten and he was a record keeper third class.


 ""Well, Critten,"" Branson roared at him, ""what have you got to say for
 yourself?""


 ""Go to hell,"" Critten said quietly. As if it were an afterthought, he
 spat at the captain.


 Branson looked as if he were going to kill the man himself right there
 and then.


 It was a long trial—from the 220th to the 241st day—and there didn't
 seem to be much doubt about the outcome, for Critten didn't help his
 own cause during any of it.


 Lemuel Tarper, who was appointed prosecutor, asked him, ""What did you
 do with the loot, Critten?""


 Critten looked him square in the eye and said, ""I threw it out one of
 the escape chutes. Does that answer your question?""


 ""Threw it away?"" Tarper and the crowd were incredulous.


 ""Sure,"" Critten said. ""You colonists got the easy life as passengers,
 just sitting around. I had to work my head off keeping records for you
 lazy bastards.""


 The verdict was, of course, death.


 They executed Harrel Critten on the morning of the 270th day with
 blasts from six stunners supplied with full power. It was witnessed
 by a great crowd in the assembly hall. A detail from the ship's crew
 disposed of his body through a chute.


 It was all duly recorded in Keith Ellason's notebooks.
Dying is easy for a Nilly. Especially if it's arranged for beforehand,
 which it always is.
The
Weblor II
was only one day out of orbit when Captain Branson sent
 for Ellason and introduced him to the executed man.


 ""Hello,"" Critten said, grinning from ear to ear.


 ""I figured as much,"" Ellason said. ""I've been doing a lot of thinking.""


 ""You're perhaps a little too good as an observer,"" Branson said. ""Or
 maybe it was because you really weren't one of the colonists. But no
 matter, Critten did a good job. He was trained by an old friend of mine
 for this job, Gelthorpe Nill. Nill used to be in counter-espionage when
 there were wars.""


 ""You were excellent,"" Ellason said.


 ""Can't say I enjoyed the role,"" said Critten, ""but I think it saved
 lives.""


 ""Let me get this straight. Interstellar thought that it was idleness
 and boredom that caused the killings on the
Weblor I
, so they had you
 trained to be a scapegoat. Is that right?""


 Critten nodded. ""When great numbers are being transported, they are apt
 to magnify each little event because so little happens. It was my job
 to see that they directed none of their venom against each other or the
 crew, only toward me.""


 Branson smiled. ""It made the time pass quickly and interestingly for
 the passengers.""


 ""To say nothing of me,"" Critten said.


 ""And you, Mr. Ellason, were along to observe it all,"" Captain Branson
 put in. ""Interstellar wanted an accurate picture of this. If it worked,
 they told me they'd use it on other trips to Antheon.""


 Ellason nodded. ""No time for brooding, for differences of opinion on
 small matters. Just time to hate Mr. Critten. Unanimously.""


 ""Probably,"" Critten said, ""you are wondering about the execution.""


 ""Naturally.""


 ""We removed the charges before the guns were used.""


 ""And Carver Janssen's case?""


 ""He'll get it back when he's shuttled to Antheon. And all the other
 items will be returned. They're all tagged with their owner's names.
 Captain Branson will say they were found somewhere on the ship. You
 see, I was a liar.""


 ""How about that assault on June Failright?""


 Critten grinned again. ""She played right into our hands. She ran out
 into the hall claiming I'd attacked her, which I did not. She was
 certainly amazed when the ship's physicians agreed with her. Of course
 Captain Branson told them to do that.""


 ""And the murder?""


 ""Raymond Palugger died in the hospital all right, but he died from
 his illness on the operating table. We turned it into an advantage by
 making it look suspicious.""


 Ellason brightened. ""And by that time everybody was seeing Red Mask
 everywhere and the colonists organized against him.""


 ""Gave them something to do,"" Branson said.


 ""Every time things got dull, I livened them up. I got a stunner and
 robbed along the corridor. That really stirred them. Lucky nobody got
 hurt during any of it, including that Stoneman woman. I was trying to
 rob her when she woke up.""
Branson cleared his throat. ""Ah, Ellason about that story. You
 understand you can't write it, don't you?""


 Ellason said regretfully that he did understand.


 ""The colonists will never know the truth,"" Branson went on. ""There will
 be other ships outward bound.""


 Critten sighed. ""And I'll have to be caught again.""
Yes, we're anonymous, nameless, we Nillys, for that's what we call
 each other, and are a theme, with variations, in the endless stretches
 of deep space, objects of hatred and contempt, professional heels,
 dying once a trip when the time is ripe, antidote to boredom, and we'll
 ply our trade, our little tragedies, on a thousand ships bringing
 humanity to new worlds.

""That all, chief? Gonna quit now?""


 Brian Hanson looked disgustedly at Pete Brent, his lanky assistant.
 That was the first sign of animation he had displayed all day.


 ""I am, but you're not,"" Hanson told him grimly. ""Get your notes
 straightened up. Run those centrifuge tests and set up the still so we
 can get at that vitamin count early in the morning.""


 ""Tomorrow morning? Aw, for gosh sakes, chief, why don't you take a day
 off sometime, or better yet, a night off. It'd do you good to relax.
 Boy, I know a swell blonde you could go for. Wait a minute, I've got
 her radiophone number somewhere—just ask for Myrtle.""


 Hanson shrugged himself out of his smock.


 ""Never mind Myrtle, just have that equipment set up for the morning.
 Good night."" He strode out of the huge laboratory, but his mind was
 still on the vitamin research they had been conducting, he barely heard
 the remarks that followed him.


 ""One of these days the chief is going to have his glands catch up with
 him.""


 ""Not a chance,"" Pete Brent grunted.


 Brian Hanson wondered dispassionately for a moment how his assistants
 could fail to be as absorbed as he was by the work they were doing,
 then he let it go as he stepped outside the research building.


 He paused and let his eyes lift to the buildings that surrounded the
 compound. This was the administrative heart of Venus City. Out here,
 alone, he let his only known emotion sweep through him, pride. He had
 an important role in the building of this great new city. As head of
 the Venus Consolidated Research Organization, he was in large part
 responsible for the prosperity of this vigorous, young world. Venus
 Consolidated had built up this city and practically everything else
 that amounted to anything on this planet. True, there had been others,
 pioneers, before the company came, who objected to the expansion of the
 monopolistic control. But, if they could not realize that the company's
 regime served the best interests of the planet, they would just have to
 suffer the consequences of their own ignorance. There had been rumors
 of revolution among the disgruntled older families.


 He heard there had been killings, but that was nonsense. Venus
 Consolidated police had only powers of arrest. Anything involving
 executions had to be referred to the Interplanetary Council on Earth.
 He dismissed the whole business as he did everything else that did not
 directly influence his own department.


 He ignored the surface transport system and walked to his own
 apartment. This walk was part of a regular routine of physical exercise
 that kept his body hard and resilient in spite of long hours spent in
 the laboratory. As he opened the door of his apartment he heard the
 water running into his bath. Perfect timing. He was making that walk
 in precisely seven minutes, four and four-fifths seconds. He undressed
 and climbed into the tub, relaxing luxuriously in the exhilaration of
 irradiated water.


 He let all the problems of his work drift away, his mind was a peaceful
 blank. Then someone was hammering on his head. He struggled reluctantly
 awake. It was the door that was being attacked, not his head. The
 battering thunder continued persistently. He swore and sat up.


 ""What do you want?""


 There was no answer; the hammering continued.


 ""All right! All right! I'm coming!"" He yelled, crawled out of the tub
 and reached for his bathrobe. It wasn't there. He swore some more and
 grabbed a towel, wrapping it inadequately around him; it didn't quite
 meet astern. He paddled wetly across the floor sounding like a flock of
 ducks on parade.


 Retaining the towel with one hand he inched the door cautiously open.


 ""What the devil—"" He stopped abruptly at the sight of a policeman's
 uniform.


 ""Sorry, sir, but one of those rebels is loose in the Administration
 Center somewhere. We're making a check-up of all the apartments.""


 ""Well, you can check out; I haven't got any blasted rebels in here.""
 The policeman's face hardened, then relaxed knowingly.


 ""Oh, I see, sir. No rebels, of course. Sorry to have disturbed you.
 Have a good—Good night, sir,"" he saluted and left.


 Brian closed the door in puzzlement. What the devil had that flat-foot
 been smirking about? Well, maybe he could get his bath now.
Hanson turned away from the door and froze in amazement. Through the
 open door of his bedroom he could see his bed neatly turned down as
 it should be, but the outline under the counterpane and the luxuriant
 mass of platinum-blond hair on the pillow was certainly no part of his
 regular routine.


 ""Hello."" The voice matched the calm alertness of a pair of deep-blue
 eyes. Brian just stared at her in numbed fascination. That was what the
 policeman had meant with his insinuating smirk.


 ""Just ask for Myrtle."" Pete Brent's joking words flashed back to him.
 Now he got it. This was probably the young fool's idea of a joke. He'd
 soon fix that.


 ""All right, joke's over, you can beat it now.""


 ""Joke? I don't see anything funny, unless it's you and that suggestive
 towel. You should either abandon it or get one that goes all the way
 round.""


 Brian slowly acquired a complexion suitable for painting fire plugs.


 ""Shut up and throw me my dressing gown."" He gritted.


 The girl swung her legs out of bed and Brian blinked; she was fully
 dressed. The snug, zippered overall suit she wore did nothing to
 conceal the fact that she was a female. He wrapped his bathrobe
 austerely around him.


 ""Well, now what?"" she asked and looked at him questioningly.


 ""Well, what do you think?"" he burst out angrily. ""I'm going to finish
 my bath and I'd suggest you go down to the laboratory and hold hands
 with Pete. He'd appreciate it."" He got the impression that the girl was
 struggling heroically to refrain from laughing and that didn't help his
 dignity any. He strode into the bathroom, slammed the door and climbed
 back into the bath.


 The door opened a little.


 ""Well, good-by now."" The girl said sweetly. ""Remember me to the police
 force.""


 ""Get out of here!"" he yelled and the door shut abruptly on a rippling
 burst of laughter. Damn women! It was getting so a man had to pack
 a gun with him or something. And Pete Brent. He thought with grim
 satisfaction of the unending extra work that was going to occur around
 the laboratory from now on. He sank back into the soothing liquid
 embrace of the bath and deliberately set his mind loose to wander in
 complete relaxation.


 A hammering thunder burst on the outer door. He sat up with a groan.


 ""Lay off, you crazy apes!"" he yelled furiously, but the pounding
 continued steadily. He struggled out of the bath, wrapped his damp
 bathrobe clammily around him and marched to the door with a seething
 fury of righteous anger burning within him. He flung the door wide, his
 mouth all set for a withering barrage, but he didn't get a chance. Four
 police constables and a sergeant swarmed into the room, shoving him
 away from the door.


 ""Say! What the—""


 ""Where is she?"" the sergeant demanded.


 ""Wherethehell's who?""


 ""Quit stallin', bud. You know who. That female rebel who was in here.""


 ""Rebel? You're crazy! That was just ... Pete said ... rebel? Did you
 say rebel?""


 ""Yeah, I said rebel, an' where is she?""


 ""She ... why ... why ... she left, of course. You don't think I was
 going to have women running around in here, do you?""


 ""She wuz in his bed when I seen her, sarge,"" one of the guards
 contributed. ""But she ain't there now.""


 ""You don't think that I—""


 ""Listen, bud, we don't do the thinkin' around here. You come on along
 and see the chief.""


 Brian had had about enough. ""I'm not going anywhere to see anybody.
 Maybe you don't know who I am. You can't arrest me.""
Brian Hanson, Chief of Research for Venus Consolidated, as dignified as
 possible in a damp bathrobe, glared out through the bars at a slightly
 bewildered Pete Brent.


 ""What the devil do you want? Haven't you caused enough blasted trouble
 already?""


 ""Me? For gosh sakes, chief—""


 ""Yes, you! If sending that damn blonde to my apartment and getting me
 arrested is your idea of a joke—""


 ""But, my gosh, I didn't send anybody, chief. And this is no joke.
 That wasn't Myrtle, that was Crystal James, old man James' daughter.
 They're about the oldest family on Venus. Police have been after her
 for months; she's a rebel and she's sure been raising plenty of hell
 around here. She got in and blew out the main communications control
 panel last night. Communications been tied up all day."" Pete lowered
 his voice to an appreciative whisper, ""Gosh, chief, I didn't know you
 had it in you. How long have you been in with that bunch? Is that girl
 as good-looking as they say she is?""


 ""Now listen here, Brent. I don't know—""


 ""Oh, it's all right, chief. You can trust me. I won't give you away.""


 ""There's nothing to give away, you fool!"" Brian bellowed. ""I don't know
 anything about any damn rebels. All I want is to get out of here—""


 ""Gotcha, chief,"" Brent whispered understandingly. ""I'll see if I can
 pass the word along.""


 ""Come here, you idiot!"" Brian screamed after his erstwhile assistant.


 ""Pipe down there, bud,"" a guard's voice cut in chillingly.


 Brian retired to his cell bunk and clutched his aching head in
 frustrated fury.


 For the nineteenth time Brian Hanson strode to the door of his cell and
 rattled the bars.


 ""Listen here, guard, you've got to take a message to McHague. You can't
 hold me here indefinitely.""


 ""Shut up. Nobody ain't takin' no message to McHague. I don't care if
 you are—""


 Brian's eyes almost popped out as he saw a gloved hand reach around
 the guard's neck and jam a rag over his nose and mouth. Swift shadows
 moved expertly before his astonished gaze. Another guard was caught and
 silenced as he came around the end of the corridor. Someone was outside
 his cell door, a hooded figure which seemed, somehow, familiar.


 ""Hello, pantless!"" a voice breathed.


 He knew that voice!


 ""What the devil are you doing here?""


 ""Somebody by the name of Pete Brent tipped us off that you were in
 trouble because of me. But don't worry, we're going to get you out.""


 ""Damn that fool kid! Leave me alone. I don't want to get out of here
 that way!"" he yelled wildly. ""Guards! Help!""


 ""Shut up! Do you want to get us shot?""


 ""Sure I do. Guards! Guards!""


 Someone came running.


 ""Guards are coming,"" a voice warned.


 He could hear the girl struggling with the lock.


 ""Damn,"" she swore viciously. ""This is the wrong key! Your goose is sure
 cooked now. Whether you like it or not, you'll hang with us when they
 find us trying to get you out of here.""


 Brian felt as though something had kicked him in the stomach. She was
 right! He had to get out now. He wouldn't be able to explain this away.


 ""Give me that key,"" he hissed and grabbed for it.


 He snapped two of the coigns off in the lock and went to work with the
 rest of the key. He had designed these escape-proof locks himself. In a
 few seconds the door swung open and they were fleeing silently down the
 jail corridor.


 The girl paused doubtfully at a crossing passage.


 ""This way,"" he snarled and took the lead. He knew the ground plan of
 this jail perfectly. He had a moment of wonder at the crazy spectacle
 of himself, the fair-haired boy of Venus Consolidated, in his flapping
 bathrobe, leading a band of escaping rebels out of the company's best
 jail.


 They burst around a corner onto a startled guard.


 ""They're just ahead of us,"" Brian yelled. ""Come on!""


 ""Right with you,"" the guard snapped and ran a few steps with them
 before a blackjack caught up with him and he folded into a corner.


 ""Down this way, it's a short cut."" Brian led the way to a heavily
 barred side door.


 The electric eye tripped a screaming alarm, but the broken key in
 Brian's hands opened the complicated lock in a matter of seconds. They
 were outside the jail on a side street, the door closed and the lock
 jammed immovably behind them.


 Sirens wailed. The alarm was out! The street suddenly burst into
 brilliance as the floodlights snapped on. Brian faltered to a stop and
 Crystal James pushed past him.


 ""We've got reinforcements down here,"" she said, then skidded to a halt.
 Two guards barred the street ahead of them.


 Brian felt as though his stomach had fallen down around his ankles
 and was tying his feet up. He couldn't move. The door was jammed shut
 behind them, they'd have to surrender and there'd be no explaining
 this break. He started mentally cursing Pete Brent, when a projector
 beam slashed viciously by him. These guards weren't fooling! He heard
 a gasping grunt of pain as one of the rebels went down. They were
 shooting to kill.


 He saw a sudden, convulsive movement from the girl. A black object
 curved out against the lights. The sharp, ripping blast of an atomite
 bomb thundered along the street and slammed them to the ground. The
 glare left them blinded. He struggled to his feet. The guards had
 vanished, a shallow crater yawned in the road where they had been.


 ""We've got to run!"" the girl shouted.


 He started after her. Two surface transport vehicles waited around the
 corner. Brian and the rebels bundled into them and took away with a
 roar. The chase wasn't organized yet, and they soon lost themselves in
 the orderly rush of Venus City traffic.
The two carloads of rebels cruised nonchalantly past the Administration
 Center and pulled into a private garage a little beyond.


 ""What are we stopping here for?"" Brian demanded. ""We've got to get
 away.""


 ""That's just what we're doing,"" Crystal snapped. ""Everybody out.""


 The rebels piled out and the cars pulled away to become innocuous parts
 of the traffic stream. The rebels seemed to know where they were going
 and that gave them the edge on Brian. They followed Crystal down into
 the garage's repair pit.


 She fumbled in the darkness a moment, then a darker patch showed as
 a door swung open in the side of the pit. They filed into the solid
 blackness after her and the door thudded shut. The beam of a torch
 stabbed through the darkness and they clambered precariously down a
 steep, steel stairway.


 ""Where the dickens are we?"" Brian whispered hoarsely.


 ""Oh, you don't have to whisper, we're safe enough here. This is one of
 the air shafts leading down to the old mines.""


 ""Old mines? What old mines?""


 ""That's something you newcomers don't know anything about. This whole
 area was worked out long before Venus Consolidated came to the planet.
 These old tunnels run all under the city.""


 They went five hundred feet down the air shaft before they reached a
 level tunnel.


 ""What do we do? Hide here?""


 ""I should say not. Serono Zeburzac, head of McHague's secret police
 will be after us now. We won't be safe anywhere near Venus City.""


 ""Don't be crazy. That Serono Zeburzac stuff is just a legend McHague
 keeps up to scare people with.""


 ""That's what you think,"" Crystal snapped. ""McHague's legend got my
 father and he'll get all of us unless we run the whole company right
 off the planet.""


 ""Well, what the dickens does he look like?"" Brian asked doubtfully.


 ""I don't know, but his left hand is missing. Dad did some good shooting
 before he died,"" she said grimly.


 Brian was startled at the icy hardness of her voice.


 Two of the rebels pulled a screening tarpaulin aside and revealed
 one of the old-type ore cars that must have been used in the ancient
 mines. A brand-new atomic motor gleamed incongruously at one end. The
 rebels crowded into it and they went rumbling swiftly down the echoing
 passage. The lights of the car showed the old working, rotten and
 crumbling, fallen in in some places and signs of new work where the
 rebels had cleared away the debris of years.


 Brian struggled into a zippered overall suit as they followed a
 twisting, tortuous course for half an hour, switching from one tunnel
 to another repeatedly until he had lost all conception of direction.
 Crystal James, at the controls, seemed to know exactly where they were
 going.


 The tunnel emerged in a huge cavern that gloomed darkly away in every
 direction. The towering, massive remains of old machinery, eroded and
 rotten with age crouched like ancient, watching skeletons.


 ""These were the old stamp mills,"" the girl said, and her voice seemed
 to be swallowed to a whisper in the vast, echoing darkness.


 Between two rows of sentinel ruins they came suddenly on two slim
 Venusian atmospheric ships. Dim light spilled over them from a ragged
 gash in the wall of the cavern. Brian followed Crystal into the smaller
 of the two ships and the rest of the rebels manned the other.


 ""Wait a minute, how do we get out of here?"" Brian demanded.


 ""Through that hole up there,"" the girl said matter-of-factly.


 ""You're crazy, you can't get through there.""


 ""Oh, yeah? Just watch this."" The ship thundered to life beneath them
 and leaped off in a full-throttled take-off.


 ""We're going to crash! That gap isn't wide enough!""


 The sides of the gap rushed in on the tips of the stubby wings. Brian
 braced himself for the crash, but it didn't come. At the last possible
 second, the ship rolled smoothly over. At the moment it flashed through
 the opening it was stood vertically on edge.
Crystal held the ship in its roll and completed the maneuver outside
 the mountain while Brian struggled to get his internal economy back
 into some semblance of order.


 ""That's some flying,"" he said as soon as he could speak.


 Crystal looked at him in surprise. ""That's nothing. We Venusians fly
 almost as soon as we can walk.""


 ""Oh—I see,"" Brian said weakly and a few moments later he really did
 see. Two big, fast, green ships, carrying the insignia of the Venus
 Consolidated police, cruised suddenly out from a mountain air station.


 An aërial torpedo exploded in front of the rebel ship. Crystal's face
 set in grim lines as she pulled the ship up in a screaming climb. Brian
 got up off the floor.


 ""You don't have to get excited like that,"" he complained. ""They weren't
 trying to hit us.""


 ""That's what you think,"" Crystal muttered. ""Those children don't play
 for peanuts.""


 ""But, girl, they're just Venus Consolidated police. They haven't got
 any authority to shoot anyone.""


 ""Authority doesn't make much difference to them,"" Crystal snapped
 bitterly. ""They've been killing people all over the planet. What do you
 think this revolution is about?""


 ""You must be mistak—"" He slumped to the floor as Crystal threw the
 ship into a mad, rolling spin. A tremendous crash thundered close
 astern.


 ""I guess that was a mistake!"" Crystal yelled as she fought the controls.


 Brian almost got to his feet when another wild maneuver hurled him back
 to the floor. The police ship was right on their tail. The girl gunned
 her craft into a snap Immelmann and swept back on their pursuers,
 slicing in close over the ship. Brian's eyes bulged as he saw a long
 streak of paint and metal ripped off the wing of the police ship. He
 saw the crew battling their controls in startled terror. The ship
 slipped frantically away and fell into a spin.


 ""That's them,"" Crystal said with satisfaction. ""How are the others
 doing?""


 ""Look! They're hit!"" Brian felt sick.
The slower rebel freight ship staggered drunkenly as a torpedo caught
 it and ripped away half a wing. It plunged down in flames with the
 white flowers of half a dozen parachutes blossoming around it. Brian
 watched in horror as the police ship came deliberately about. They
 heard its forward guns go into action. The bodies of the parachutists
 jerked and jumped like crazy marionettes as the bullets smashed into
 them. It was over in a few moments. The dead rebels drifted down into
 the mist-shrouded depths of the valley.


 ""The dirty, murdering rats!"" Brian's voice ripped out in a fury of
 outrage. ""They didn't have a chance!""


 ""Don't get excited,"" Crystal told him in a dead, flat voice. ""That's
 just normal practice. If you'd stuck your nose out of your laboratory
 once in a while, you'd have heard of these things.""


 ""But why—"" He ducked away instinctively as a flight of bullets spanged
 through the fuselage. ""They're after us now!""


 Crystal's answer was to yank the ship into a rocketing climb. The
 police were watching for that. The big ship roared up after them.


 ""Just follow along, suckers,"" Crystal invited grimly.


 She snapped the ship into a whip stall. For one nauseating moment they
 hung on nothing, then the ship fell over on its back and they screamed
 down in a terminal velocity dive, heading for the safety of the lower
 valley mists. The heavier police ship, with its higher wing-loading,
 could not match the maneuver. The rebel craft plunged down through the
 blinding fog. Half-seen, ghostly fingers of stone clutched up at them,
 talons of gray rock missed and fell away again as Crystal nursed the
 ship out of its dive.


 ""
Phew!
"" Brian gasped. ""Well, we got away that time. How in thunder
 can you do it?""


 ""Well, you don't do it on faith. Take a look at that fuel gauge! We
 may get as far as our headquarters—or we may not.""
For twenty long minutes they groped blindly through the fog, flying
 solely by instruments and dead reckoning. The needle of the fuel gauge
 flickered closer and closer to the danger point. They tore loose from
 the clinging fog as it swung firmly to ""Empty."" The drive sputtered and
 coughed and died.


 ""That's figuring it nice and close,"" Crystal said in satisfaction. ""We
 can glide in from here.""


 ""Into where?"" Brian demanded. All he could see immediately ahead was
 the huge bulk of a mountain which blocked the entire width of the
 valley and soared sheer up to the high-cloud level. His eyes followed
 it up and up—


 ""Look! Police ships. They've seen us!""


 ""Maybe they haven't. Anyway, there's only one place we can land.""


 The ship lunged straight for the mountain wall!


 ""Are you crazy? Watch out—we'll crash!""


 ""You leave the flying to me,"" Crystal snapped.


 She held the ship in its glide, aiming directly for the tangled foliage
 of the mountain face. Brian yelped and cowered instinctively back. The
 lush green of the mountainside swirled up to meet them. They ripped
 through the foliage—there was no crash. They burst through into a
 huge, brilliantly lighted cavern and settled to a perfect landing. Men
 came running. Crystal tumbled out of her ship.


 ""Douse those lights,"" she shouted. ""The police are outside.""


 A tall, lean man with bulbous eyes and a face like a startled horse,
 rushed up to Crystal.


 ""What do you mean by leading them here?"" he yelled, waving his hands.


 ""They jumped us when we had no fuel, and quit acting like an idiot.""


 The man was shaking, his eyes looked wild. ""They'll kill us. We've got
 to get out of here.""


 ""Wait, you fool. They may not even have seen us."" But he was gone,
 running toward a group of ships lined up at the end of the cavern.


 ""Who was that crazy coot and what is this place?"" Brian demanded.


 ""That was Gort Sterling, our leader,"" the girl said bitterly. ""And
 this is our headquarters."" One of the ships at the back of the cavern
 thundered to life, streaked across the floor and burst out through the
 opening Crystal's ship had left. ""He hasn't got a chance! We'll be
 spotted for sure, now.""


 The other rebels waited uncertainly, but not for long. There was the
 crescendoing roar of ships in a dive followed by the terrific crash of
 an explosion.


 ""They got him!"" Crystal's voice was a moan. ""Oh, the fool, the fool!""


 ""Sounded like more than one ship. They'll be after us, now. Is there
 any other way of getting out of this place?""


 ""Not for ships. We'll have to walk and they'll follow us.""


 ""We've got to slow them down some way, then. I wonder how the devil
 they traced us? I thought we lost them in that fog.""


 ""It's that Serono Zeburzac, the traitor. He knows these mountains as
 well as we do.""


 ""How come?""


 ""The Zeburzacs are one of the old families, but he sold out to McHague.""


 ""Well, what do we do now? Just stand here? It looks like everybody's
 leaving.""


 ""We might as well just wait,"" Crystal said hopelessly. ""It won't do us
 any good to run out into the hills. Zeburzac and his men will follow.""


 ""We could slow them down some by swinging a couple of those ships
 around so their rocket exhausts sweep the entrance to the cavern,""
 Brian suggested doubtfully. She looked at him steadily.


 ""You sound like the only good rebel left. We can try it, anyway.""
They ran two ships out into the middle of the cavern, gunned them
 around and jockeyed them into position—not a moment too soon.


 Half a dozen police showed in brief silhouette as they slipped
 cautiously into the cavern, guns ready, expecting resistance. They met
 a dead silence. A score or more followed them without any attempt at
 concealment. Then Brian and Crystal cut loose with the drives of the
 two ships.


 Startled screams of agony burst from the crowded group of police as
 they were caught in the annihilating cross fire of roaring flame.
 They crisped and twisted, cooked to scorched horrors before they
 fell. A burst of thick, greasy smoke rushed out of the cavern. Two of
 the police, their clothes and flesh scorched and flaming, plunged as
 shrieking, living torches down the mountainside.


 Crystal was white and shaking, her face set in a mask of horror, as she
 climbed blindly from her ship.


 ""Let's get away! I can smell them burning,"" she shuddered and covered
 her face with her hands.


 Brian grabbed her and shook her.


 ""Snap out of it,"" he barked. ""That's no worse than shooting helpless
 men in parachutes. We can't go, yet; we're not finished here.""


 ""Oh, let them shoot us! I can't go through that again!""


 ""You don't have to. Wait here.""


 He climbed back into one of the ships and cut the richness of the fuel
 mixture down till the exhaust was a lambent, shuddering stutter,
 verging on extinction. He dashed to the other ship and repeated the
 maneuver, fussing with the throttle till he had the fuel mixture
 adjusted to critical fineness. The beat of the stuttering exhaust
 seemed to catch up to the other and built to an aching pulsation. In
 a moment the whole mass of air in the cavern hit the frequency with a
 subtle, intangible thunder of vibration.


 Crystal screamed. ""Brian! There's more police cutting in around the
 entrance.""


 Brian clambered out of the ship and glanced at the glowing points
 in the rock where the police were cutting their way through outside
 the line of the exhaust flames. The pulsating thunder in the cavern
 crescendoed to an intolerable pitch. A huge mass of stalactites crashed
 to the floor.


 ""It's time to check out,"" Brian shouted.


 Crystal led the way as they fled down the escape tunnel. The roaring
 crash of falling rock was a continuous, increasing avalanche of sound
 in the cavern behind them.


 They emerged from the tunnel on the face of the mountain, several
 hundred yards to the east of the cavern entrance. The ground shook and
 heaved beneath them.


 ""The whole side of the mountain's sliding,"" Crystal screamed.


 ""Run!"" Brian shoved her and they plunged madly through the thick tangle
 of jungle away from the slide.


 Huge boulders leaped and smashed through the matted bush around them.
 Crystal went down as the ground slipped from under her. Brian grabbed
 her and a tree at the same time. The tree leaned and crashed down the
 slope, the whole jungle muttered and groaned and came to life as it
 joined the roaring rush of the slide. They were tumbled irresistibly
 downward, riding the edge of the slide for terrifying minutes till
 it stilled and left them bruised and shaken in a tangle of torn
 vegetation.


 The remains of two police ships, caught without warning in the rush as
 they attempted to land, stuck up grotesquely out of the foot of the
 slide. The dust was settling away. A flock of brilliant blue, gliding
 lizards barking in raucous terror, fled down the valley. Then they were
 gone and the primeval silence settled back into place.


 Brian and Crystal struggled painfully to solid ground. Crystal gazed
 with a feeling of awe at the devastated mountainside.


 ""How did you do it?""


 ""It's a matter of harmonics,"" Brian explained. ""If you hit the right
 vibratory combination, you can shake anything down. But now that we've
 made a mess of the old homestead, what do we do?""


 ""Walk,"" Crystal said laconically. She led the way as they started
 scrambling through the jungle up the mountainside.


 ""Where are we heading for?"" Brian grunted as he struggled along.


 ""The headquarters of the Carlton family. They're the closest people we
 can depend on. They've kept out of the rebellion, but they're on our
 side. They've helped us before.""

The high costs of low language. 

         Sunday, Jan. 14, 1996: A day that will live in--well, not infamy, exactly. Blasphemy would be closer to it. 

         Early that afternoon, the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts to win the American Football Conference championship. Linebacker Greg Lloyd, accepting the trophy in front of a national television audience, responded with enthusiasm. ""Let's see if we can bring this damn thing back here next year,"" he said, ""along with the [expletive] Super Bowl."" 

         A few hours later, Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys offered this spirited defense of his coach on TV after his team won the National Football Conference title: ""Nobody deserves it more than Barry Switzer. He took all of this [expletive] ."" 

         Iwatched those episodes, and, incongruous as it may sound, I thought of Kenneth Tynan. Britain's great postwar drama critic was no fan of American football, but he was a fan of swearing. Thirty years earlier, almost to the week, Tynan was interviewed on BBC television in his capacity as literary director of Britain's National Theater and asked if he would allow the theater to present a play in which sex took place on stage. ""Certainly,"" he replied. ""I think there are very few rational people in this world to whom the word '[expletive]' is particularly diabolical or revolting or totally forbidden."" 

         It turned out there were a few more than Tynan thought. Within 24 hours, resolutions had been introduced in the House of Commons calling for his prosecution on charges of obscenity, for his removal as a theater official, and for censure of the network for allowing an obscene word to go out on the airwaves. Tynan escaped punishment, but he acquired a public reputation for tastelessness that he carried for the rest his life. To much of ordinary Britain, he became the man who had said ""[expletive]"" on the BBC. 

         Neither Greg Lloyd nor Michael Irvin was so stigmatized. ""It's live television,"" NBC Vice President Ed Markey said, rationalizing the outbursts. ""It's an emotional moment. These things happen."" Irvin wasn't about to let that stand. ""I knew exactly what I was saying,"" he insisted later. ""Those of you who can't believe I said it--believe it."" 

         Swearing isn't the only public act that Western civilization condones today but didn't 30 years ago. But it is one of the most interesting. It is everywhere, impossible to avoid or tune out. 

           

          

            I am sitting in a meeting at the office, talking with a colleague about a business circumstance that may possibly go against us. ""In that case, we're [expletive] ,"" he says. Five years ago, he would have said ""screwed."" Twenty years ago, he would have said, ""We're in big trouble."" Societal tolerance of profanity requires us to increase our dosage as time goes on.   

             

            I am walking along a suburban street, trailing a class of pre-schoolers who are linked to each other by a rope. A pair of teen-agers passes us in the other direction. By the time they have reached the end of the line of children, they have tossed off a whole catalog of obscenities I did not even hear until I was well into adolescence, let alone use in casual conversation on a public street.   

             

            I am talking to a distinguished professor of public policy about a foundation grant. I tell her something she wasn't aware of before. In 1965, the appropriate response was ""no kidding."" In 1996, you do not say ""no kidding."" It is limp and ineffectual. If you are surprised at all, you say what she says: ""No shit."" 

          

         What word is taboo in middle-class America in 1996? There are a couple of credible candidates: The four-letter word for ""vagina"" remains off-limits in polite conversation (although that has more to do with feminism than with profanity), and the slang expression for those who engage in oral sex with males is not yet acceptable by the standards of office-meeting etiquette. 

         But aside from a few exceptions, the supply of genuinely offensive language has dwindled almost to nothing as the 20th century comes to an end; the currency of swearing has been inflated to the brink of worthlessness. When almost anything can be said in public, profanity ceases to exist in any meaningful way at all. 

         That most of the forbidden words of the 1950s are no longer forbidden will come as news to nobody: The steady debasement of the common language is only one of many social strictures that have loosened from the previous generation to the current. What is important is that profanity served a variety of purposes for a long time in Western culture. It does not serve those purposes any more. 

         What purposes? There are a couple of plausible answers. One of them is emotional release. Robert Graves, who wrote a book in the 1920s called The Future of Swearing , thought that profanity was the adult replacement for childhood tears. There comes a point in life, he wrote, when ""wailing is rightly discouraged, and groans are also considered a signal of extreme weakness. Silence under suffering is usually impossible."" So one reaches back for a word one does not normally use, and utters it without undue embarrassment or guilt. And one feels better--even stimulated. 

         The anthropologist Ashley Montagu, whose Anatomy of Swearing , published in 1967, is the definitive modern take on the subject, saw profanity as a safety valve rather than a stimulant, a verbal substitute for physical aggression. When someone swears, Montagu wrote, ""potentially noxious energy is converted into a form that renders it comparatively innocuous."" 

         One could point out, in arguing against the safety-valve theory, that as America has grown more profane in the past 30 years, it has also grown more violent, not less. But this is too simple. It isn't just the supply of dirty words that matters, it's their emotive power. If they have lost that power through overuse, it's perfectly plausible to say that their capacity to deter aggressive behavior has weakened as well. 

         But there is something else important to say about swearing--that it represents the invocation of those ideas a society considers powerful, awesome, and a little scary. 

         I'm not sure there is an easy way to convey to anybody under 30, for example, the sheer emotive force that the word ""[expletive]"" possessed in the urban childhood culture of 40 years ago. It was the verbal link to a secret act none of us understood but that was known to carry enormous consequences in the adult world. It was the embodiment of both pleasure and danger. It was not a word or an idea to mess with. When it was used, it was used, as Ashley Montagu said, ""sotto voce , like a smuggler cautiously making his way across a forbidden frontier."" 

         In that culture, the word ""[expletive]"" was not only obscene, it was profane, in the original sense: It took an important idea in vain. Profanity can be an act of religious defiance, but it doesn't have to be. The Greeks tempted fate by invoking the names of their superiors on Mount Olympus; they also swore upon everyday objects whose properties they respected but did not fully understand. ""By the Cabbage!"" Socrates is supposed to have said in moments of stress, and that was for good reason. He believed that cabbage cured hangovers, and as such, carried sufficient power and mystery to invest any moment with the requisite emotional charge. 

         These days, none of us believes in cabbage in the way Socrates did, or in the gods in the way most Athenians did. Most Americans tell poll-takers that they believe in God, but few of them in a way that would make it impossible to take His name in vain: That requires an Old Testament piety that disappeared from American middle-class life a long time ago. 

         Nor do we believe in sex any more the way most American children and millions of adults believed in it a generation ago: as an act of profound mystery and importance that one did not engage in, or discuss, or even invoke, without a certain amount of excitement and risk. We have trivialized and routinized sex to the point where it just doesn't carry the emotional freight it carried in the schoolyards and bedrooms of the 1950s. 

         Many enlightened people consider this to be a great improvement over a society in which sex generated not only emotion and power, but fear. For the moment, I wish to insist only on this one point: When sexuality loses its power to awe, it loses its power to create genuine swearing. When we convert it into a casual form of recreation, we shouldn't be surprised to hear linebackers using the word ""[expletive]"" on national television. 

         To profane something, in other words, one must believe in it. The cheapening of profanity in modern America represents, more than anything else, the crumbling of belief. There are very few ideas left at this point that are awesome or frightening enough for us to enforce a taboo against them. 

         The instinctive response of most educated people to the disappearance of any taboo is to applaud it, but this is wrong. Healthy societies need a decent supply of verbal taboos and prohibitions, if only as yardsticks by which ordinary people can measure and define themselves. By violating these taboos over and over, some succeed in defining themselves as rebels. Others violate them on special occasions to derive an emotional release. Forbidden language is one of the ways we remind children that there are rules to everyday life, and consequences for breaking them. When we forget this principle, or cease to accept it, it is not just our language that begins to fray at the edges. 

         What do we do about it? Well, we could pass a law against swearing. Mussolini actually did that. He decreed that trains and buses, in addition to running on time, had to carry signs that read ""Non bestemmiare per l'onore d'Italia."" (""Do not swear for the honor of Italy."") The commuters of Rome reacted to those signs exactly as you would expect: They cursed them. 

         What Mussolini could not do, I am reasonably sure that American governments of the 1990s cannot do, nor would I wish it. I merely predict that sometime in the coming generation, profanity will return in a meaningful way. It served too many purposes for too many years of American life to disappear on a permanent basis. We need it. 

         And so I am reasonably sure that when my children have children, there will once again be words so awesome that they cannot be uttered without important consequences. This will not only represent a new stage of linguistic evolution, it will be a token of moral revival. What the dirty words will be, God only knows.

Gutenberg,"SECOND LANDING
By FLOYD WALLACE
A gentle fancy for the Christmas Season—an
 oft-told tale with a wistful twistful of Something
 that left the Earth with a wing and a prayer.
Earth
 was so far away that
 it wasn't visible. Even the
 sun was only a twinkle. But this
 vast distance did not mean that
 isolation could endure forever.
 Instruments within the ship intercepted
 radio broadcasts and,
 within the hour, early TV signals.
 Machines compiled dictionaries
 and grammars and began
 translating the major languages.
 The history of the planet was
 tabulated as facts became available.


 The course of the ship changed
 slightly; it was not much out of
 the way to swing nearer Earth.
 For days the two within the ship
 listened and watched with little
 comment. They had to decide
 soon.


 ""We've got to make or break,""
 said the first alien.


 ""You know what I'm in favor
 of,"" said the second.


 ""I can guess,"" said Ethaniel,
 who had spoken first. ""The place
 is a complete mess. They've never
 done anything except fight
 each other—and invent better
 weapons.""


 ""It's not what they've done,""
 said Bal, the second alien. ""It's
 what they're going to do, with
 that big bomb.""


 ""The more reason for stopping,""
 said Ethaniel. ""The big
 bomb can destroy them. Without
 our help they may do just that.""


 ""I may remind you that in two
 months twenty-nine days we're
 due in Willafours,"" said Bal.
 ""Without looking at the charts
 I can tell you we still have more
 than a hundred light-years to
 go.""


 ""A week,"" said Ethaniel. ""We
 can spare a week and still get
 there on time.""


 ""A week?"" said Bal. ""To settle
 their problems? They've had two
 world wars in one generation
 and that the third and final one
 is coming up you can't help feeling
 in everything they do.""


 ""It won't take much,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""The wrong diplomatic
 move, or a trigger-happy soldier
 could set it off. And it wouldn't
 have to be deliberate. A meteor
 shower could pass over and their
 clumsy instruments could interpret
 it as an all-out enemy
 attack.""


 ""Too bad,"" said Bal. ""We'll
 just have to forget there ever
 was such a planet as Earth.""


 ""Could you? Forget so many
 people?""


 ""I'm doing it,"" said Bal. ""Just
 give them a little time and they
 won't be here to remind me that
 I have a conscience.""


 ""My memory isn't convenient,""
 said Ethaniel. ""I ask you
 to look at them.""
Bal rustled, flicking the screen
 intently. ""Very much like ourselves,""
 he said at last. ""A bit
 shorter perhaps, and most certainly
 incomplete. Except for the
 one thing they lack, and that's
 quite odd, they seem exactly like
 us. Is that what you wanted me
 to say?""


 ""It is. The fact that they are
 an incomplete version of ourselves
 touches me. They actually
 seem defenseless, though I suppose
 they're not.""


 ""Tough,"" said Bal. ""Nothing
 we can do about it.""


 ""There is. We can give them
 a week.""


 ""In a week we can't negate
 their entire history. We can't
 begin to undo the effect of the
 big bomb.""


 ""You can't tell,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""We can look things over.""


 ""And then what? How much
 authority do we have?""


 ""Very little,"" conceded Ethaniel.
 ""Two minor officials on the
 way to Willafours—and we run
 directly into a problem no one
 knew existed.""


 ""And when we get to Willafours
 we'll be busy. It will be a
 long time before anyone comes
 this way again.""


 ""A very long time. There's
 nothing in this region of space
 our people want,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""And how long can Earth last?
 Ten years? Even ten months?
 The tension is building by the
 hour.""


 ""What can I say?"" said Bal.
 ""I suppose we can stop and look
 them over. We're not committing
 ourselves by looking.""


 They went much closer to
 Earth, not intending to commit
 themselves. For a day they circled
 the planet, avoiding radar
 detection, which for them was
 not difficult, testing, and sampling.
 Finally Ethaniel looked up
 from the monitor screen. ""Any
 conclusions?""


 ""What's there to think? It's
 worse than I imagined.""


 ""In what way?""


 ""Well, we knew they had the
 big bomb. Atmospheric analysis
 showed that as far away as we
 were.""


 ""I know.""


 ""We also knew they could deliver
 the big bomb, presumably
 by some sort of aircraft.""


 ""That was almost a certainty.
 They'd have no use for the big
 bomb without aircraft.""


 ""What's worse is that I now
 find they also have missiles,
 range one thousand miles and
 upward. They either have or are
 near a primitive form of space
 travel.""


 ""Bad,"" said Ethaniel. ""Sitting
 there, wondering when it's going
 to hit them. Nervousness could
 set it off.""


 ""It could, and the missiles
 make it worse,"" said Bal. ""What
 did you find out at your end?""


 ""Nothing worthwhile. I was
 looking at the people while you
 were investigating their weapons.""


 ""You must think something.""


 ""I wish I knew what to think.
 There's so little time,"" Ethaniel
 said. ""Language isn't the difficulty.
 Our machines translate
 their languages easily and I've
 taken a cram course in two or
 three of them. But that's not
 enough, looking at a few plays,
 listening to advertisements, music,
 and news bulletins. I should
 go down and live among them,
 read books, talk to scholars, work
 with them, play.""


 ""You could do that and you'd
 really get to know them. But
 that takes time—and we don't
 have it.""


 ""I realize that.""


 ""A flat yes or no,"" said Bal.


 ""No. We can't help them,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""There is nothing we
 can do for them—but we have to
 try.""


 ""Sure, I knew it before we
 started,"" said Bal. ""It's happened
 before. We take the trouble to
 find out what a people are like
 and when we can't help them we
 feel bad. It's going to be that
 way again."" He rose and stretched.
 ""Well, give me an hour to
 think of some way of going at
 it.""
It was longer than that before
 they met again. In the meantime
 the ship moved much closer to
 Earth. They no longer needed instruments
 to see it. The planet
 revolved outside the visionports.
 The southern plains were green,
 coursed with rivers; the oceans
 were blue; and much of the
 northern hemisphere was glistening
 white. Ragged clouds covered
 the pole, and a dirty pall
 spread over the mid-regions of
 the north.


 ""I haven't thought of anything
 brilliant,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""Nor I,"" said Bal. ""We're going
 to have to go down there
 cold. And it will be cold.""


 ""Yes. It's their winter.""


 ""I did have an idea,"" said Bal.
 ""What about going down as supernatural
 beings?""


 ""Hardly,"" said Ethaniel. ""A
 hundred years ago it might have
 worked. Today they have satellites.
 They are not primitives.""


 ""I suppose you're right,"" said
 Bal. ""I did think we ought to
 take advantage of our physical
 differences.""


 ""If we could I'd be all for it.
 But these people are rough and
 desperate. They wouldn't be
 fooled by anything that crude.""


 ""Well, you're calling it,"" said
 Bal.


 ""All right,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""You take one side and I the
 other. We'll tell them bluntly
 what they'll have to do if they're
 going to survive, how they can
 keep their planet in one piece so
 they can live on it.""


 ""That'll go over big. Advice is
 always popular.""


 ""Can't help it. That's all we
 have time for.""


 ""Special instructions?""


 ""None. We leave the ship here
 and go down in separate landing
 craft. You can talk with me any
 time you want to through our
 communications, but don't unless
 you have to.""


 ""They can't intercept the
 beams we use.""


 ""They can't, and even if they
 did they wouldn't know what to
 do with our language. I want
 them to think that we don't
need
to talk things over.""


 ""I get it. Makes us seem better
 than we are. They think we know
 exactly what we're doing even
 though we don't.""


 ""If we're lucky they'll think
 that.""
Bal looked out of the port at
 the planet below. ""It's going to
 be cold where I'm going. You too.
 Sure we don't want to change
 our plans and land in the southern
 hemisphere? It's summer
 there.""


 ""I'm afraid not. The great
 powers are in the north. They
 are the ones we have to reach to
 do the job.""


 ""Yeah, but I was thinking of
 that holiday you mentioned.
 We'll be running straight into it.
 That won't help us any.""


 ""I know, they don't like their
 holidays interrupted. It can't be
 helped. We can't wait until it's
 over.""


 ""I'm aware of that,"" said Bal.
 ""Fill me in on that holiday, anything
 I ought to know. Probably
 religious in origin. That so?""


 ""It was religious a long time
 ago,"" said Ethaniel. ""I didn't
 learn anything exact from radio
 and TV. Now it seems to be
 chiefly a time for eating, office
 parties, and selling merchandise.""


 ""I see. It has become a business
 holiday.""


 ""That's a good description. I
 didn't get as much of it as I
 ought to have. I was busy studying
 the people, and they're hard
 to pin down.""


 ""I see. I was thinking there
 might be some way we could tie
 ourselves in with this holiday.
 Make it work for us.""


 ""If there is I haven't thought
 of it.""


 ""You ought to know. You're
 running this one."" Bal looked
 down at the planet. Clouds were
 beginning to form at the twilight
 edge. ""I hate to go down
 and leave the ship up here with
 no one in it.""


 ""They can't touch it. No matter
 how they develop in the next
 hundred years they still won't be
 able to get in or damage it in
 any way.""


 ""It's myself I'm thinking
 about. Down there, alone.""


 ""I'll be with you. On the other
 side of the Earth.""


 ""That's not very close. I'd like
 it better if there were someone
 in the ship to bring it down in a
 hurry if things get rough. They
 don't think much of each other.
 I don't imagine they'll like aliens
 any better.""


 ""They may be unfriendly,""
 Ethaniel acknowledged. Now he
 switched a monitor screen until
 he looked at the slope of a mountain.
 It was snowing and men
 were cutting small green trees in
 the snow. ""I've thought of a
 trick.""


 ""If it saves my neck I'm for
 it.""


 ""I don't guarantee anything,""
 said Ethaniel. ""This is what I
 was thinking of: instead of hiding
 the ship against the sun
 where there's little chance it will
 be seen, we'll make sure that
 they do see it. Let's take it
 around to the night side of the
 planet and light it up.""


 ""Say, pretty good,"" said Bal.


 ""They can't imagine that we'd
 light up an unmanned ship,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""Even if the thought
 should occur to them they'll have
 no way of checking it. Also, they
 won't be eager to harm us with
 our ship shining down on them.""


 ""That's thinking,"" said Bal,
 moving to the controls. ""I'll move
 the ship over where they can see
 it best and then I'll light it up.
 I'll really light it up.""


 ""Don't spare power.""


 ""Don't worry about that.
 They'll see it. Everybody on
 Earth will see it."" Later, with the
 ship in position, glowing against
 the darkness of space, pulsating
 with light, Bal said: ""You know,
 I feel better about this. We may
 pull it off. Lighting the ship may
 be just the help we need.""


 ""It's not we who need help, but
 the people of Earth,"" said Ethaniel.
 ""See you in five days."" With
 that he entered a small landing
 craft, which left a faintly luminescent
 trail as it plunged toward
 Earth. As soon as it was
 safe to do so, Bal left in another
 craft, heading for the other side
 of the planet.
And the spaceship circled
 Earth, unmanned, blazing and
 pulsing with light. No star in the
 winter skies of the planet below
 could equal it in brilliancy. Once
 a man-made satellite came near
 but it was dim and was lost sight
 of by the people below. During
 the day the ship was visible as
 a bright spot of light. At evening
 it seemed to burn through
 the sunset colors.


 And the ship circled on,
 bright, shining, seeming to be a
 little piece clipped from the center
 of a star and brought near
 Earth to illuminate it. Never, or
 seldom, had Earth seen anything
 like it.


 In five days the two small landing
 craft that had left it arched
 up from Earth and joined the
 orbit of the large ship. The two
 small craft slid inside the large
 one and doors closed behind
 them. In a short time the aliens
 met again.


 ""We did it,"" said Bal exultantly
 as he came in. ""I don't know
 how we did it and I thought we
 were going to fail but at the last
 minute they came through.""


 Ethaniel smiled. ""I'm tired,""
 he said, rustling.


 ""Me too, but mostly I'm cold,""
 said Bal, shivering. ""Snow.
 Nothing but snow wherever I
 went. Miserable climate. And yet
 you had me go out walking after
 that first day.""


 ""From my own experience it
 seemed to be a good idea,"" said
 Ethaniel. ""If I went out walking
 one day I noticed that the next
 day the officials were much more
 cooperative. If it worked for me
 I thought it might help you.""


 ""It did. I don't know why, but
 it did,"" said Bal. ""Anyway, this
 agreement they made isn't the
 best but I think it will keep them
 from destroying themselves.""


 ""It's as much as we can expect,""
 said Ethaniel. ""They may
 have small wars after this, but
 never the big one. In fifty or a
 hundred years we can come back
 and see how much they've
 learned.""


 ""I'm not sure I want to,"" said
 Bal. ""Say, what's an angel?""


 ""Why?""


 ""When I went out walking
 people stopped to look. Some
 knelt in the snow and called me
 an angel.""


 ""Something like that happened
 to me,"" said Ethaniel.


 ""I didn't get it but I didn't let
 it upset me,"" said Bal. ""I smiled
 at them and went about my business.""
 He shivered again. ""It was
 always cold. I walked out, but
 sometimes I flew back. I hope
 that was all right.""


 In the cabin Bal spread his
 great wings. Renaissance painters
 had never seen his like but
 knew exactly how he looked. In
 their paintings they had pictured
 him innumerable times.


 ""I don't think it hurt us that
 you flew,"" said Ethaniel. ""I did
 so myself occasionally.""


 ""But you don't know what an
 angel is?""


 ""No. I didn't have time to find
 out. Some creature of their folklore
 I suppose. You know, except
 for our wings they're very much
 like ourselves. Their legends are
 bound to resemble ours.""


 ""Sure,"" said Bal. ""Anyway,
 peace on Earth.""

 TACTICS
By AL SEVCIK
ILLUSTRATOR NOVICK
The robots were built to serve
 Man; to do his work, see to his
 comforts, make smooth his way.
 Then the robots figured out an
 additional service—putting Man
 out of his misery.
There
 was a sudden crash
 that hung sharply in the air,
 as if a tree had been hit by
 lightning some distance away.
 Then another. Alan stopped,
 puzzled. Two more blasts, quickly
 together, and the sound of a
 scream faintly.


 Frowning, worrying about the
 sounds, Alan momentarily forgot
 to watch his step until his foot
 suddenly plunged into an ant
 hill, throwing him to the jungle
 floor. ""Damn!"" He cursed again,
 for the tenth time, and stood
 uncertainly in the dimness.
 From tall, moss-shrouded trees,
 wrist-thick vines hung quietly,
 scraping the spongy ground like
 the tentacles of some monstrous
 tree-bound octopus. Fitful little
 plants grew straggly in the
 shadows of the mossy trunks,
 forming a dense underbrush that
 made walking difficult. At midday
 some few of the blue sun's
 rays filtered through to the
 jungle floor, but now, late afternoon
 on the planet, the shadows
 were long and gloomy.


 Alan peered around him at the
 vine-draped shadows, listening
 to the soft rustlings and faint
 twig-snappings of life in the
 jungle. Two short, popping
 sounds echoed across the stillness,
 drowned out almost immediately
 and silenced by an
 explosive crash. Alan started,
 ""Blaster fighting! But it can't
 be!""


 Suddenly anxious, he slashed
 a hurried X in one of the trees
 to mark his position then turned
 to follow a line of similar marks
 back through the jungle. He
 tried to run, but vines blocked
 his way and woody shrubs
 caught at his legs, tripping him
 and holding him back. Then,
 through the trees he saw the
 clearing of the camp site, the
 temporary home for the scout
 ship and the eleven men who,
 with Alan, were the only humans
 on the jungle planet, Waiamea.
Stepping through the low
 shrubbery at the edge of the
 site, he looked across the open
 area to the two temporary structures,
 the camp headquarters
 where the power supplies and
 the computer were; and the
 sleeping quarters. Beyond, nose
 high, stood the silver scout ship
 that had brought the advance
 exploratory party of scientists
 and technicians to Waiamea
 three days before. Except for a
 few of the killer robots rolling
 slowly around the camp site on
 their quiet treads, there was no
 one about.


 ""So, they've finally got those
 things working."" Alan smiled
 slightly. ""Guess that means I
 owe Pete a bourbon-and-soda
 for sure. Anybody who can
 build a robot that hunts by homing
 in on animals' mind impulses ...""
 He stepped forward
 just as a roar of blue flame dissolved
 the branches of a tree,
 barely above his head.


 Without pausing to think,
 Alan leaped back, and fell
 sprawling over a bush just as
 one of the robots rolled silently
 up from the right, lowering its
 blaster barrel to aim directly at
 his head. Alan froze. ""My God,
 Pete built those things wrong!""


 Suddenly a screeching whirlwind
 of claws and teeth hurled
 itself from the smoldering
 branches and crashed against the
 robot, clawing insanely at the
 antenna and blaster barrel.
 With an awkward jerk the robot
 swung around and fired its blaster,
 completely dissolving the
 lower half of the cat creature
 which had clung across the barrel.
 But the back pressure of the
 cat's body overloaded the discharge
 circuits. The robot started
 to shake, then clicked sharply
 as an overload relay snapped
 and shorted the blaster cells.
 The killer turned and rolled back
 towards the camp, leaving Alan
 alone.


 Shakily, Alan crawled a few
 feet back into the undergrowth
 where he could lie and watch the
 camp, but not himself be seen.
 Though visibility didn't make
 any difference to the robots, he
 felt safer, somehow, hidden. He
 knew now what the shooting
 sounds had been and why there
 hadn't been anyone around the
 camp site. A charred blob lying
 in the grass of the clearing confirmed
 his hypothesis. His stomach
 felt sick.


 ""I suppose,"" he muttered to
 himself, ""that Pete assembled
 these robots in a batch and then
 activated them all at once, probably
 never living to realize that
 they're tuned to pick up human
 brain waves, too. Damn!
 Damn!"" His eyes blurred and
 he slammed his fist into the soft
 earth.


 When he raised his eyes again
 the jungle was perceptibly darker.
 Stealthy rustlings in the
 shadows grew louder with the
 setting sun. Branches snapped
 unaccountably in the trees overhead
 and every now and then
 leaves or a twig fell softly to the
 ground, close to where he lay.
 Reaching into his jacket, Alan
 fingered his pocket blaster. He
 pulled it out and held it in his
 right hand. ""This pop gun
 wouldn't even singe a robot, but
 it just might stop one of those
 pumas.""
They said the blast with your name on it would find
 you anywhere. This looked like Alan's blast.
Slowly Alan looked around,
 sizing up his situation. Behind
 him the dark jungle rustled forbiddingly.
 He shuddered. ""Not a
 very healthy spot to spend the
 night. On the other hand, I certainly
 can't get to the camp with
 a pack of mind-activated mechanical
 killers running around.
 If I can just hold out until morning,
 when the big ship arrives ...
 The big ship! Good
 Lord, Peggy!"" He turned white;
 oily sweat punctuated his forehead.
 Peggy, arriving tomorrow
 with the other colonists, the
 wives and kids! The metal killers,
 tuned to blast any living
 flesh, would murder them the
 instant they stepped from the
 ship!
A pretty girl, Peggy, the girl
 he'd married just three weeks
 ago. He still couldn't believe it.
 It was crazy, he supposed, to
 marry a girl and then take off
 for an unknown planet, with her
 to follow, to try to create a home
 in a jungle clearing. Crazy maybe,
 but Peggy and her green eyes
 that changed color with the
 light, with her soft brown hair,
 and her happy smile, had ended
 thirty years of loneliness and
 had, at last, given him a reason
 for living. ""Not to be killed!""
 Alan unclenched his fists and
 wiped his palms, bloody where
 his fingernails had dug into the
 flesh.


 There was a slight creak above
 him like the protesting of a
 branch too heavily laden. Blaster
 ready, Alan rolled over onto his
 back. In the movement, his elbow
 struck the top of a small
 earthy mound and he was instantly
 engulfed in a swarm of
 locust-like insects that beat disgustingly
 against his eyes and
 mouth. ""Fagh!"" Waving his
 arms before his face he jumped
 up and backwards, away from
 the bugs. As he did so, a dark
 shapeless thing plopped from
 the trees onto the spot where he
 had been lying stretched out.
 Then, like an ambient fungus,
 it slithered off into the jungle
 undergrowth.


 For a split second the jungle
 stood frozen in a brilliant blue
 flash, followed by the sharp report
 of a blaster. Then another.
 Alan whirled, startled. The
 planet's double moon had risen
 and he could see a robot rolling
 slowly across the clearing in his
 general direction, blasting indiscriminately
 at whatever mind
 impulses came within its pickup
 range, birds, insects, anything.
 Six or seven others also left the
 camp headquarters area and
 headed for the jungle, each to a
 slightly different spot.


 Apparently the robot hadn't
 sensed him yet, but Alan didn't
 know what the effective range
 of its pickup devices was. He
 began to slide back into the
 jungle. Minutes later, looking
 back he saw that the machine,
 though several hundred yards
 away, had altered its course and
 was now headed directly for
 him.


 His stomach tightened. Panic.
 The dank, musty smell of the
 jungle seemed for an instant to
 thicken and choke in his throat.
 Then he thought of the big ship
 landing in the morning, settling
 down slowly after a lonely two-week
 voyage. He thought of a
 brown-haired girl crowding with
 the others to the gangway, eager
 to embrace the new planet, and
 the next instant a charred nothing,
 unrecognizable, the victim
 of a design error or a misplaced
 wire in a machine. ""I have to
 try,"" he said aloud. ""I have to
 try."" He moved into the blackness.


 Powerful as a small tank, the
 killer robot was equipped to
 crush, slash, and burn its way
 through undergrowth. Nevertheless,
 it was slowed by the
 larger trees and the thick, clinging
 vines, and Alan found that
 he could manage to keep ahead
 of it, barely out of blaster range.
 Only, the robot didn't get tired.
 Alan did.


 The twin moons cast pale, deceptive
 shadows that wavered
 and danced across the jungle
 floor, hiding debris that tripped
 him and often sent him sprawling
 into the dark. Sharp-edged
 growths tore at his face and
 clothes, and insects attracted by
 the blood matted against his
 pants and shirt. Behind, the robot
 crashed imperturbably after
 him, lighting the night with fitful
 blaster flashes as some
 winged or legged life came within
 its range.


 There was movement also, in
 the darkness beside him, scrapings
 and rustlings and an occasional
 low, throaty sound like an
 angry cat. Alan's fingers tensed
 on his pocket blaster. Swift
 shadowy forms moved quickly in
 the shrubs and the growling became
 suddenly louder. He fired
 twice, blindly, into the undergrowth.
 Sharp screams punctuated
 the electric blue discharge as
 a pack of small feline creatures
 leaped snarling and clawing
 back into the night.
Mentally, Alan tried to figure
 the charge remaining in his blaster.
 There wouldn't be much.
 ""Enough for a few more shots,
 maybe. Why the devil didn't I
 load in fresh cells this morning!""


 The robot crashed on, louder
 now, gaining on the tired human.
 Legs aching and bruised,
 stinging from insect bites, Alan
 tried to force himself to run
 holding his hands in front of
 him like a child in the dark. His
 foot tripped on a barely visible
 insect hill and a winged swarm
 exploded around him. Startled,
 Alan jerked sideways, crashing
 his head against a tree. He
 clutched at the bark for a second,
 dazed, then his knees
 buckled. His blaster fell into the
 shadows.


 The robot crashed loudly behind
 him now. Without stopping
 to think, Alan fumbled along the
 ground after his gun, straining
 his eyes in the darkness. He
 found it just a couple of feet to
 one side, against the base of a
 small bush. Just as his fingers
 closed upon the barrel his other
 hand slipped into something
 sticky that splashed over his
 forearm. He screamed in pain
 and leaped back, trying frantically
 to wipe the clinging,
 burning blackness off his arm.
 Patches of black scraped off onto
 branches and vines, but the rest
 spread slowly over his arm as
 agonizing as hot acid, or as flesh
 being ripped away layer by
 layer.


 Almost blinded by pain, whimpering,
 Alan stumbled forward.
 Sharp muscle spasms shot from
 his shoulder across his back and
 chest. Tears streamed across his
 cheeks.


 A blue arc slashed at the trees
 a mere hundred yards behind.
 He screamed at the blast. ""Damn
 you, Pete! Damn your robots!
 Damn, damn ... Oh, Peggy!""
 He stepped into emptiness.


 Coolness. Wet. Slowly, washed
 by the water, the pain began to
 fall away. He wanted to lie there
 forever in the dark, cool, wetness.
 For ever, and ever, and ...
 The air thundered.


 In the dim light he could see
 the banks of the stream, higher
 than a man, muddy and loose.
 Growing right to the edge of the
 banks, the jungle reached out
 with hairy, disjointed arms as
 if to snag even the dirty little
 stream that passed so timidly
 through its domain.


 Alan, lying in the mud of the
 stream bed, felt the earth shake
 as the heavy little robot rolled
 slowly and inexorably towards
 him. ""The Lord High Executioner,""
 he thought, ""in battle
 dress."" He tried to stand but his
 legs were almost too weak and
 his arm felt numb. ""I'll drown
 him,"" he said aloud. ""I'll drown
 the Lord High Executioner."" He
 laughed. Then his mind cleared.
 He remembered where he was.
Alan trembled. For the first
 time in his life he understood
 what it was to live, because for
 the first time he realized that he
 would sometime die. In other
 times and circumstances he
 might put it off for a while, for
 months or years, but eventually,
 as now, he would have to watch,
 still and helpless, while death
 came creeping. Then, at thirty,
 Alan became a man.


 ""Dammit, no law says I have
 to flame-out
now
!"" He forced
 himself to rise, forced his legs
 to stand, struggling painfully in
 the shin-deep ooze. He worked
 his way to the bank and began to
 dig frenziedly, chest high, about
 two feet below the edge.


 His arm where the black thing
 had been was swollen and tender,
 but he forced his hands to dig,
 dig, dig, cursing and crying to
 hide the pain, and biting his
 lips, ignoring the salty taste of
 blood. The soft earth crumbled
 under his hands until he had a
 small cave about three feet deep
 in the bank. Beyond that the
 soil was held too tightly by the
 roots from above and he had to
 stop.
The air crackled blue and a
 tree crashed heavily past Alan
 into the stream. Above him on
 the bank, silhouetting against
 the moons, the killer robot stopped
 and its blaster swivelled
 slowly down. Frantically, Alan
 hugged the bank as a shaft of
 pure electricity arced over him,
 sliced into the water, and exploded
 in a cloud of steam. The
 robot shook for a second, its
 blaster muzzle lifted erratically
 and for an instant it seemed almost
 out of control, then it
 quieted and the muzzle again
 pointed down.


 Pressing with all his might,
 Alan slid slowly along the bank
 inches at a time, away from the
 machine above. Its muzzle turned
 to follow him but the edge of
 the bank blocked its aim. Grinding
 forward a couple of feet,
 slightly overhanging the bank,
 the robot fired again. For a split
 second Alan seemed engulfed in
 flame; the heat of hell singed his
 head and back, and mud boiled
 in the bank by his arm.


 Again the robot trembled. It
 jerked forward a foot and its
 blaster swung slightly away. But
 only for a moment. Then the gun
 swung back again.


 Suddenly, as if sensing something
 wrong, its tracks slammed
 into reverse. It stood poised for
 a second, its treads spinning
 crazily as the earth collapsed underneath
 it, where Alan had
 dug, then it fell with a heavy
 splash into the mud, ten feet
 from where Alan stood.


 Without hesitation Alan
 threw himself across the blaster
 housing, frantically locking his
 arms around the barrel as the
 robot's treads churned furiously
 in the sticky mud, causing it to
 buck and plunge like a Brahma
 bull. The treads stopped and the
 blaster jerked upwards wrenching
 Alan's arms, then slammed
 down. Then the whole housing
 whirled around and around, tilting
 alternately up and down like
 a steel-skinned water monster
 trying to dislodge a tenacious
 crab, while Alan, arms and legs
 wrapped tightly around the blaster
 barrel and housing, pressed
 fiercely against the robot's metal
 skin.


 Slowly, trying to anticipate
 and shift his weight with the
 spinning plunges, Alan worked
 his hand down to his right hip.
 He fumbled for the sheath clipped
 to his belt, found it, and extracted
 a stubby hunting knife.
 Sweat and blood in his eyes,
 hardly able to move on the wildly
 swinging turret, he felt down
 the sides to the thin crack between
 the revolving housing and
 the stationary portion of the robot.
 With a quick prayer he
 jammed in the knife blade—and
 was whipped headlong into the
 mud as the turret literally snapped
 to a stop.


 The earth, jungle and moons
 spun in a pinwheeled blur,
 slowed, and settled to their proper
 places. Standing in the sticky,
 sweet-smelling ooze, Alan eyed
 the robot apprehensively. Half
 buried in mud, it stood quiet in
 the shadowy light except for an
 occasional, almost spasmodic
 jerk of its blaster barrel. For
 the first time that night Alan
 allowed himself a slight smile.
 ""A blade in the old gear box,
 eh? How does that feel, boy?""


 He turned. ""Well, I'd better
 get out of here before the knife
 slips or the monster cooks up
 some more tricks with whatever
 it's got for a brain."" Digging
 little footholds in the soft bank,
 he climbed up and stood once
 again in the rustling jungle
 darkness.


 ""I wonder,"" he thought, ""how
 Pete could cram enough brain
 into one of those things to make
 it hunt and track so perfectly.""
 He tried to visualize the computing
 circuits needed for the
 operation of its tracking mechanism
 alone. ""There just isn't
 room for the electronics. You'd
 need a computer as big as the
 one at camp headquarters.""
In the distance the sky blazed
 as a blaster roared in the jungle.
 Then Alan heard the approaching
 robot, crunching and snapping
 its way through the undergrowth
 like an onrushing forest
 fire. He froze. ""Good Lord!
 They communicate with each
 other! The one I jammed must
 be calling others to help.""


 He began to move along the
 bank, away from the crashing
 sounds. Suddenly he stopped, his
 eyes widened. ""Of course! Radio!
 I'll bet anything they're
 automatically controlled by the
 camp computer. That's where
 their brain is!"" He paused.
 ""Then, if that were put out of
 commission ..."" He jerked away
 from the bank and half ran, half
 pulled himself through the undergrowth
 towards the camp.


 Trees exploded to his left as
 another robot fired in his direction,
 too far away to be effective
 but churning towards him
 through the blackness.


 Alan changed direction slightly
 to follow a line between the
 two robots coming up from
 either side, behind him. His eyes
 were well accustomed to the dark
 now, and he managed to dodge
 most of the shadowy vines and
 branches before they could snag
 or trip him. Even so, he stumbled
 in the wiry underbrush and
 his legs were a mass of stinging
 slashes from ankle to thigh.


 The crashing rumble of the
 killer robots shook the night behind
 him, nearer sometimes,
 then falling slightly back, but
 following constantly, more
 unshakable than bloodhounds
 because a man can sometimes cover
 a scent, but no man can stop his
 thoughts. Intermittently, like
 photographers' strobes, blue
 flashes would light the jungle
 about him. Then, for seconds
 afterwards his eyes would see
 dancing streaks of yellow and
 sharp multi-colored pinwheels
 that alternately shrunk and expanded
 as if in a surrealist's
 nightmare. Alan would have to
 pause and squeeze his eyelids
 tight shut before he could see
 again, and the robots would
 move a little closer.


 To his right the trees silhouetted
 briefly against brilliance as
 a third robot slowly moved up
 in the distance. Without thinking,
 Alan turned slightly to the
 left, then froze in momentary
 panic. ""I should be at the camp
 now. Damn, what direction am
 I going?"" He tried to think
 back, to visualize the twists and
 turns he'd taken in the jungle.
 ""All I need is to get lost.""


 He pictured the camp computer
 with no one to stop it, automatically
 sending its robots in
 wider and wider forays, slowly
 wiping every trace of life from
 the planet. Technologically advanced
 machines doing the job
 for which they were built, completely,
 thoroughly, without feeling,
 and without human masters
 to separate sense from futility.
 Finally parts would wear out,
 circuits would short, and one by
 one the killers would crunch to
 a halt. A few birds would still
 fly then, but a unique animal
 life, rare in the universe, would
 exist no more. And the bones of
 children, eager girls, and their
 men would also lie, beside a
 rusty hulk, beneath the alien
 sun.


 ""Peggy!""


 As if in answer, a tree beside
 him breathed fire, then exploded.
 In the brief flash of the
 blaster shot, Alan saw the steel
 glint of a robot only a hundred
 yards away, much nearer than
 he had thought. ""Thank heaven
 for trees!"" He stepped back, felt
 his foot catch in something,
 clutched futilely at some leaves
 and fell heavily.


 Pain danced up his leg as he
 grabbed his ankle. Quickly he
 felt the throbbing flesh. ""Damn
 the rotten luck, anyway!"" He
 blinked the pain tears from his
 eyes and looked up—into a robot's
 blaster, jutting out of the
 foliage, thirty yards away.
Instinctively, in one motion
 Alan grabbed his pocket blaster
 and fired. To his amazement the
 robot jerked back, its gun wobbled
 and started to tilt away.
 Then, getting itself under control,
 it swung back again to face
 Alan. He fired again, and again
 the robot reacted. It seemed familiar
 somehow. Then he remembered
 the robot on the river
 bank, jiggling and swaying for
 seconds after each shot. ""Of
 course!"" He cursed himself for
 missing the obvious. ""The blaster
 static blanks out radio
 transmission from the computer
 for a few seconds. They even do
 it to themselves!""


 Firing intermittently, he
 pulled himself upright and hobbled
 ahead through the bush.
 The robot shook spasmodically
 with each shot, its gun tilted upward
 at an awkward angle.


 Then, unexpectedly, Alan saw
 stars, real stars brilliant in the
 night sky, and half dragging his
 swelling leg he stumbled out of
 the jungle into the camp clearing.
 Ahead, across fifty yards of
 grass stood the headquarters
 building, housing the robot-controlling
 computer. Still firing at
 short intervals he started across
 the clearing, gritting his teeth
 at every step.


 Straining every muscle in
 spite of the agonizing pain, Alan
 forced himself to a limping run
 across the uneven ground, carefully
 avoiding the insect hills
 that jutted up through the grass.
 From the corner of his eye he
 saw another of the robots standing
 shakily in the dark edge of
 the jungle waiting, it seemed,
 for his small blaster to run dry.


 ""Be damned! You can't win
 now!"" Alan yelled between blaster
 shots, almost irrational from
 the pain that ripped jaggedly
 through his leg. Then it happened.
 A few feet from the
 building's door his blaster quit.
 A click. A faint hiss when he
 frantically jerked the trigger
 again and again, and the spent
 cells released themselves from
 the device, falling in the grass
 at his feet. He dropped the useless
 gun.


 ""No!"" He threw himself on
 the ground as a new robot suddenly
 appeared around the edge
 of the building a few feet away,
 aimed, and fired. Air burned
 over Alan's back and ozone tingled
 in his nostrils.


 Blinding itself for a few seconds
 with its own blaster static,
 the robot paused momentarily,
 jiggling in place. In this
 instant, Alan jammed his hands
 into an insect hill and hurled the
 pile of dirt and insects directly
 at the robot's antenna. In a flash,
 hundreds of the winged things
 erupted angrily from the hole in
 a swarming cloud, each part of
 which was a speck of life
 transmitting mental energy to the
 robot's pickup devices.


 Confused by the sudden dispersion
 of mind impulses, the
 robot fired erratically as Alan
 crouched and raced painfully for
 the door. It fired again, closer,
 as he fumbled with the lock
 release. Jagged bits of plastic and
 stone ripped past him, torn loose
 by the blast.


 Frantically, Alan slammed
 open the door as the robot, sensing
 him strongly now, aimed
 point blank. He saw nothing, his
 mind thought of nothing but the
 red-clad safety switch mounted
 beside the computer. Time stopped.
 There was nothing else in
 the world. He half-jumped, half-fell
 towards it, slowly, in tenths
 of seconds that seemed measured
 out in years.


 The universe went black.


 Later. Brilliance pressed upon
 his eyes. Then pain returned, a
 multi-hurting thing that crawled
 through his body and dragged
 ragged tentacles across his
 brain. He moaned.


 A voice spoke hollowly in the
 distance. ""He's waking. Call his
 wife.""


 Alan opened his eyes in a
 white room; a white light hung
 over his head. Beside him, looking
 down with a rueful smile,
 stood a young man wearing
 space medical insignia. ""Yes,""
 he acknowledged the question in
 Alan's eyes, ""you hit the switch.
 That was three days ago. When
 you're up again we'd all like to
 thank you.""


 Suddenly a sobbing-laughing
 green-eyed girl was pressed
 tightly against him. Neither of
 them spoke. They couldn't. There
 was too much to say.

MASTER SPY OF THE RED PLANET


 Jery Delvin had a most unusual talent. He could detect the flaws in
 any scheme almost on sight—even where they had eluded the best brains
 in the ad agency where he worked. So when the Chief of World Security
 told him that he had been selected as the answer to the Solar System's
 greatest mystery, Jery assumed that it was because of his mental
 agility.


 But when he got to Mars to find out why fifteen boys had vanished from
 a spaceship in mid-space, he found out that even his quick mind needed
 time to pierce the maze of out-of-this-world double-dealing. For Jery
 had become a walking bomb, and when he set himself off, it would be the
 end of the whole puzzle of THE SECRET MARTIANS—with Jery as the first
 to go!


 Jack Sharkey decided to be a writer nineteen years ago, in the Fourth
 Grade, when he realized all at once that ""someone wrote all those
 stories in the textbooks."" While everyone else looked forward variously
 to becoming firemen, cowboys, and trapeze artists, Jack was devouring
 every book he could get his hands on, figuring that ""if I put enough
 literature into my head, some of it might overflow and come out.""


 After sixteen years of education, Jack found himself teaching high
 school English in Chicago, a worthwhile career, but ""not what one would
 call zesty."" After a two-year Army hitch, and a year in advertising
 ""sublimating my urge to write things for cash,"" Jack moved to New York,
 determined to make a career of full-time fiction-writing.


 Oddly enough, it worked out, and he now does nothing else. He says,
 ""I'd like to say I do this for fulfillment, or for cash, or because
 it's my destiny; however, the real reason (same as that expressed by
 Jean Kerr) is that this kind of stay-at-home self-employment lets me
 sleep late in the morning.""
1
I was sitting at my desk, trying to decide how to tell the women of
 America that they were certain to be lovely in a Plasti-Flex brassiere
 without absolutely guaranteeing them anything, when the two security
 men came to get me. I didn't quite believe it at first, when I looked
 up and saw them, six-feet-plus of steel nerves and gimlet eyes, staring
 down at me, amidst my litter of sketches, crumpled copy sheets and
 deadline memos.


 It was only a fraction of an instant between the time I saw them and
 the time they spoke to me, but in that miniscule interval I managed
 to retrace quite a bit of my lifetime up till that moment, seeking
 vainly for some reason why they'd be standing there, so terribly and
 inflexibly efficient looking. Mostly, I ran back over all the ads I'd
 created and/or okayed for Solar Sales, Inc. during my five years with
 the firm, trying to see just where I'd gone and shaken the security
 of the government. I couldn't find anything really incriminating,
 unless maybe it was that hair dye that unexpectedly turned bright green
 after six weeks in the hair, but that was the lab's fault, not mine.
 So I managed a weak smile toward the duo, and tried not to sweat too
 profusely.


 ""Jery Delvin?"" said the one on my left, a note of no-funny-business in
 his brusque baritone.


 ""... Yes,"" I said, some terrified portion of my mind waiting
 masochistically for them to draw their collapsers and reduce me to a
 heap of hot protons.


 ""Come with us,"" said his companion. I stared at him, then glanced
 hopelessly at the jumble of things on my desk. ""Never mind that stuff,""
 he added.


 I rose from my place, slipped my jacket from its hook, and started
 across the office toward the door, each of them falling into rigid step
 beside me. Marge, my secretary, stood wide-eyed as we passed through
 her office, heading for the hall exit.


 ""Mr. Delvin,"" she said, her voice a wispy croak. ""When will you be
 back? The Plasti-Flex man is waiting for your—""


 I opened my mouth, but one of the security men cut in.


 ""You will be informed,"" he said to Marge.


 She was staring after me, open-mouthed, as the door slid neatly shut
 behind us.


 ""
W-Will
I be back?"" I asked desperately, as we waited for the
 elevator. ""At all? Am I under arrest? What's up, anyhow?""


 ""You will be informed,"" said the man again. I had to let it go at that.
 Security men were not hired for their loquaciousness. They had a car
 waiting at the curb downstairs, in the No Parking zone. The cop on the
 beat very politely opened the door for them when we got there. Those
 red-and-bronze uniforms carry an awful lot of weight. Not to mention
 the golden bulk of their holstered collapsers.


 There was nothing for me to do but sweat it out and to try and enjoy
 the ride, wherever we were going.
""
You
are Jery Delvin?""


 The man who spoke seemed more than surprised; he seemed stunned. His
 voice held an incredulous squeak, a squeak which would have amazed his
 subordinates. It certainly amazed me. Because the speaker was Philip
 Baxter, Chief of Interplanetary Security, second only to the World
 President in power, and not even that in matters of security. I managed
 to nod.


 He shook his white-maned head, slowly. ""I don't believe it.""


 ""But I am, sir,"" I insisted doggedly.


 Baxter pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes for a moment,
 then sighed, grinned wryly, and waggled an index finger at an empty
 plastic contour chair.


 ""I guess maybe you are at that, son. Sit down, sit down.""


 I folded gingerly at knees and hips and slid back into the chair,
 pressing my perspiring palms against the sides of my pants to get rid
 of their uncomfortably slippery feel. ""Thank you, sir.""


 There was a silence, during which I breathed uneasily, and a bit too
 loudly. Baxter seemed to be trying to say something.


 ""I suppose you're wondering why I've called—"" he started, then stopped
 short and flushed with embarrassment. I felt a sympathetic hot wave
 flooding my own features. A copy chief in an advertising company almost
 always reacts to an obvious cliche.


 Then, with something like a look of relief on his blunt face, he
 snatched up a brochure from his kidney-shaped desktop and his eyes
 raced over the lettering on its face.


 ""Jery Delvin,"" he read, musingly and dispassionately. ""Five foot eleven
 inches tall, brown hair, slate-gray eyes. Citizen. Honest, sober,
 civic-minded, slightly antisocial....""


 He looked at me, questioningly.


 ""I'd rather not discuss that, sir, if you don't mind.""


 ""Do you mind if I do mind?""


 ""Oh ... Oh, well if you put it like that. It's girls, sir. They block
 my mind. Ruin my work.""


 ""I don't get you.""


 ""Well, in my job—See, I've got this gift. I'm a spotter.""


 ""A what?""


 ""A spotter. I can't be fooled. By advertising. Or mostly anything else.
 Except girls.""


 ""I'm still not sure that I—""


 ""It's like this. I designate ratios, by the minute. They hand me a new
 ad, and I read it by a stopwatch. Then, as soon as I spot the clinker,
 they stop the watch. If I get it in five seconds, it passes. But if I
 spot it in less, they throw it out and start over again. Or is that
 clear? No, I guess you're still confused, sir.""


 ""Just a bit,"" Baxter said.


 I took a deep breath and tried again.


 ""Maybe an example would be better. Uh, you know the one about 'Three
 out of five New York lawyers use Hamilton Bond Paper for note-taking'?""


 ""I've heard that, yes.""


 ""Well, the clinker—that's the sneaky part of the ad, sir, or what we
 call weasel-wording—the clinker in that one is that while it seems to
 imply sixty percent of New York lawyers, it actually means precisely
 what it says: Three out of five. For that particular product, we had
 to question seventy-nine lawyers before we could come up with three who
 liked Hamilton Bond, see? Then we took the names of the three, and the
 names of two of the seventy-six men remaining, and kept them on file.""


 ""On file?"" Baxter frowned. ""What for?""


 ""In case the Federal Trade Council got on our necks. We could prove
 that three out of five lawyers used the product. Three out of those
 five. See?""


 ""Ah,"" said Baxter, grinning. ""I begin to. And your job is to test these
 ads, before they reach the public. What fools you for five seconds will
 fool the average consumer indefinitely.""


 I sat back, feeling much better. ""That's right, sir.""


 Then Baxter frowned again. ""But what's this about girls?""


 ""They—they block my thinking, sir, that's all. Why, take that example
 I just mentioned. In plain writing, I caught the clinker in one-tenth
 of a second. Then they handed me a layout with a picture of a lawyer
 dictating notes to his secretary on it. Her legs were crossed. Nice
 legs. Gorgeous legs....""


 ""How long that time, Delvin?""


 ""Indefinite. Till they took the girl away, sir.""


 Baxter cleared his throat loudly. ""I understand, at last. Hence your
 slight antisocial rating. You avoid women in order to keep your job.""


 ""Yes, sir. Even my secretary, Marge, whom I'd never in a million years
 think of looking at twice, except for business reasons, of course, has
 to stay out of my office when I'm working, or I can't function.""


 ""You have my sympathy, son,"" Baxter said, not unkindly.


 ""Thank you, sir. It hasn't been easy.""


 ""No, I don't imagine it has...."" Baxter was staring into some far-off
 distance. Then he remembered himself and blinked back to the present.
 ""Delvin,"" he said sharply. ""I'll come right to the point. This thing
 is.... You have been chosen for an extremely important mission.""


 I couldn't have been more surprised had he announced my incipient
 maternity, but I was able to ask, ""Me? For Pete's sake, why, sir?""


 Baxter looked me square in the eye. ""Damned if I know!""
2
I stared at him, nonplussed. He'd spoken with evidence of utmost
 candor, and the Chief of Interplanetary Security was not one to be
 accused of a friendly josh, but—""You're kidding!"" I said. ""You must
 be. Otherwise, why was I sent for?""


 ""Believe me, I wish I knew,"" he sighed. ""You were chosen, from all
 the inhabitants of this planet, and all the inhabitants of the Earth
 Colonies, by the Brain.""


 ""You mean that International Cybernetics picked me for a mission?
 That's crazy, if you'll pardon me, sir.""


 Baxter shrugged, and his genial smile was a bit tightly stretched.
 ""When the current emergency arose and all our usual methods failed, we
 had to submit the problem to the Brain.""


 ""And,"" I said, beginning to be fascinated by his bewildered manner,
 ""what came out?""


 He looked at me for a long moment, then picked up that brochure again,
 and said, without referring to it, ""Jery Delvin, five foot eleven
 inches tall—""


 ""Yes, but read me the part where it says why I was picked,"" I said, a
 little exasperated.


 Baxter eyed me balefully, then skimmed the brochure through the air in
 my direction. I caught it just short of the carpet.


 ""If you can find it, I'll read it!"" he said, almost snarling.


 I looked over the sheet, then turned it over and scanned the black
 opposite side. ""All it gives is my description, governmental status,
 and address!""


 ""Uh-huh,"" Baxter grunted laconically. ""It amuses you, does it?"" The
 smile was still on his lips, but there was a grimness in the glitter of
 his narrowing eyes.


 ""Not really,"" I said hastily. ""It baffles me, to be frank.""


 ""If you're sitting there in that hopeful stance awaiting some sort of
 explanation, you may as well relax,"" Baxter said shortly. ""I have none
 to make. IC had none to make. Damn it all to hell!"" He brought a meaty
 fist down on the desktop. ""No one has an explanation! All we know is
 that the Brain always picks the right man.""


 I let this sink in, then asked, ""What made you ask for a man in
 the first place, sir? I've always understood that your own staff
 represented some of the finest minds—""


 ""Hold it, son. Perhaps I didn't make myself clear. We asked for no man.
 We asked for a solution to an important problem. And your name was what
 we got. You, son, are the solution.""


 Chief of Security or not, I was getting a little burned up at his
 highhanded treatment of my emotions. ""How nice!"" I said icily. ""Now if
 I only knew the problem!""


 Baxter blinked, then lost some of his scowl. ""Yes, of course;"" Baxter
 murmured, lighting up a cigar. He blew a plume of blue smoke toward the
 ceiling, then continued. ""You've heard, of course, of the Space Scouts?""


 I nodded. ""Like the old-time Boy Scouts, only with rocket-names for
 their various troops in place of the old animal names.""


 ""And you recall the recent government-sponsored trip they had? To Mars
 and back, with the broadly-smiling government picking up the enormous
 tab?""


 I detected a tinge of cynicism in his tone, but said nothing.


 ""What a gesture!"" Baxter went on, hardly speaking directly to me at
 all. ""Inter-nation harmony! Good will! If these mere boys can get
 together and travel the voids of space, then so can everyone else! Why
 should there be tensions between the various nations comprising the
 World Government, when there's none between these fine lads, one from
 every civilized nation on Earth?""


 ""You sound disillusioned, sir,"" I interjected.


 He stared at me as though I'd just fallen in from the ceiling or
 somewhere. ""Huh? Oh, yes, Delvin, isn't it? Sorry, I got carried away.
 Where was I?""


 ""You were telling about how this gesture, the WG sending these kids
 off for an extraterrestrial romp, will cement relations between those
 nations who have remained hostile despite the unification of all
 governments on Earth. Personally, I think it was a pretty good idea,
 myself. Everybody likes kids. Take this jam we were trying to push.
 Pomegranate Nectar, it was called. Well, sir, it just wouldn't sell,
 and then we got this red-headed kid with freckles like confetti all
 over his slightly bucktoothed face, and we—Sir?""


 I'd paused, because he was staring at me like a man on the brink of
 apoplexy. I swallowed, and tried to look relaxed.


 After a moment, he found his voice. ""To go on, Delvin. Do you recall
 what happened to the Space Scouts last week?""


 I thought a second, then nodded. ""They've been having such a good time
 that the government extended their trip by—Why are you shaking your
 head that way, sir?""


 ""Because it's not true, Delvin,"" he said. His voice was suddenly old
 and tired, and very much in keeping with his snowy hair. ""You see, the
 Space Scouts have vanished.""


 I came up in the chair, ramrod-straight. ""Their mothers—they've been
 getting letters and—""


 ""Forgeries, Fakes. Counterfeits.""


 ""You mean whoever took the Scouts is falsifying—""


 ""No.
My
men are doing the work. Handpicked crews, day and night,
 have been sending those letters to the trusting mothers. It's been
 ghastly, Delvin. Hard on the men, terribly hard. Undotted
i
's,
 misuse of tenses, deliberate misspellings. They take it out of an
 adult, especially an adult with a mind keen enough to get him into
 Interplanetary Security. We've limited the shifts to four hours per man
 per day. Otherwise, they'd all be gibbering by now!""


 ""And your men haven't found out anything?"" I marvelled.


 Baxter shook his head.


 ""And you finally had to resort to the Brain, and it gave you my name,
 but no reason for it?""


 Baxter cupped his slightly jowled cheeks in his hands and propped his
 elbows on the desktop, suddenly slipping out of his high position to
 talk to me man-to-man. ""Look, son, an adding machine—which is a minor
 form of an electronic brain, and even works on the same principle—can
 tell you that two and two make four. But can it tell you why?


 ""Well, no, but—""


 ""That, in a nutshell is our problem. We coded and fed to the Brain
 every shred of information at our disposal; the ages of the children,
 for instance, and all their physical attributes, and where they were
 last seen, and what they were wearing. Hell, everything! The machine
 took the factors, weighed them, popped them through its billions of
 relays and tubes, and out of the end of the answer slot popped a single
 sheet. The one you just saw. Your dossier.""


 ""Then I'm to be sent to Mars?"" I said, nervously.


 ""That's just it,"" Baxter sighed. ""We don't even know that! We're like a
 savage who finds a pistol: used correctly, it's a mean little weapon;
 pointed the wrong way, it's a quick suicide. So, you are our weapon.
 Now, the question is: Which way do we point you?""


 ""You got me!"" I shrugged hopelessly.


 ""However, since we have nothing else to go on but the locale from which
 the children vanished, my suggestion would be to send you there.""


 ""Mars, you mean,"" I said.


 ""No, to the spaceship
Phobos II
. The one they were returning to Earth
 in when they disappeared.""


 ""They disappeared from a spaceship? While in space?""


 Baxter nodded.


 ""But that's impossible,"" I said, shaking my head against this
 disconcerting thought.


 ""Yes,"" said Baxter. ""That's what bothers me.""
3
Phobos II
, for obvious reasons, was berthed in a Top Security
 spaceport. Even so, they'd shuttled it into a hangar, safe from the
 eyes of even their own men, and as a final touch had hidden the ship's
 nameplate beneath magnetic repair-plates.


 I had a metal disk—bronze and red, the Security colors—insigniaed
 by Baxter and counterembossed with the President's special device, a
 small globe surmounted by clasping hands. It gave me authority to do
 anything. With such an identification disc, I could go to Times Square
 and start machine gunning the passers-by, and not one of New York's
 finest would raise a hand to stop me.


 And, snugly enholstered, I carried a collapser, the restricted weapon
 given only to Security Agents, so deadly was its molecule-disrupting
 beam. Baxter had spent a tremulous hour showing me how to use the
 weapon, and especially how to turn the beam off. I'd finally gotten the
 hang of it, though not before half his kidney-shaped desk had flashed
 into nothingness, along with a good-sized swath of carpeting and six
 inches of concrete floor.


 His parting injunction had been. ""Be careful, Delvin, huh?""


 Yes, parting. I was on my own. After all, with a Security disc—the
 Amnesty, they called it—such as I possessed, and a collapser, I could
 go anywhere, do anything, commandeer anything I might need. All with
 no questions asked. Needless to say, I was feeling pretty chipper as I
 entered the hangar housing
Phobos II
. At the moment, I was the most
 influential human being in the known universe.


 The pilot, as per my videophoned request, was waiting there for me. I
 saw him as I stepped into the cool shadows of the building from the hot
 yellow sunlight outside. He was tall, much taller than I, but he seemed
 nervous as hell. At least he was pacing back and forth amid a litter
 of half-smoked cigarette butts beside the gleaming tailfins of the
 spaceship, and a fuming butt was puckered into place in his mouth.


 ""Anders?"" I said, approaching to within five feet of him before
 halting, to get the best psychological effect from my appearance.


 He turned, saw me, and hurriedly spat the butt out onto the cement
 floor. ""Yes, sir!"" he said loudly, throwing me a quivering salute. His
 eyes were a bit wild as they took me in.


 And well they might be. An Amnesty-bearer can suddenly decide a subject
 is not answering questions to his satisfaction and simply blast the
 annoying party to atoms. It makes for straight responses. Of course,
 I was dressing the part, in a way. I wore the Amnesty suspended by a
 thin golden chain from my neck, and for costume I wore a raven-black
 blouse and matching uniform trousers and boots. I must have looked
 quite sinister. I'm under six feet, but I'm angular and wiry. Thus,
 in ominous black, with an Amnesty on my breast and a collapser in
 my holster, I was a sight to strike even honest citizens into quick
 examinations of conscience. I felt a little silly, but the outfit was
 Baxter's idea.


 ""I understand you were aboard the
Phobos II
when the incident
 occurred?"" I said sternly, which was unusual for my wonted demeanor.


 ""Yes, sir!"" he replied swiftly, at stiff attention.


 ""I don't really have any details,"" I said, and waited for him to take
 his cue. As an afterthought, to help him talk, I added, ""At ease, by
 the way, Anders.""


 ""Thank you, sir,"" he said, not actually loosening much in his rigid
 position, but his face looking happier. ""See, I was supposed to pilot
 the kids back here from Mars when their trip was done, and—"" He gave
 a helpless shrug. ""I dunno, sir. I got 'em all aboard, made sure they
 were secure in the takeoff racks, and then I set my coordinates for
 Earth and took off. Just a run-of-the-mill takeoff, sir.""


 ""And when did you notice they were missing?"" I asked, looking at the
 metallic bulk of the ship and wondering what alien force could snatch
 fifteen fair-sized young boys through its impervious hull without
 leaving a trace.


 ""Chow time, sir. That's when you expect to have the little—to have
 the kids in your hair, sir. Everyone wants his rations first—You know
 how kids are, sir. So I went to the galley and was about to open up
 the ration packs, when I noticed how damned quiet it was aboard. And
 especially funny that no one was in the galley waiting for me to start
 passing the stuff out.""


 ""So you searched,"" I said.


 Anders nodded sorrowfully. ""Not a trace of 'em, sir. Just some of their
 junk left in their storage lockers.""


 I raised my eyebrows. ""Really? I'd be interested in seeing this junk,
 Anders.""


 ""Oh, yes, sir. Right this way, sir. Watch out for these rungs, they're
 slippery.""


 I ascended the retractable metal rungs that jutted from a point
 between the tailfins to the open airlock, twenty feet over ground
 level, and followed Anders inside the ship.


 I trailed Anders through the ship, from the pilot's compartment—a
 bewildering mass of dials, switches, signal lights and wire—through
 the galley into the troop section. It was a cramped cubicle housing a
 number of nylon-webbed foam rubber bunks. The bunks were empty, but I
 looked them over anyhow. I carefully tugged back the canvas covering
 that fitted envelope-fashion over a foam rubber pad, and ran my finger
 over the surface of the pad. It came away just slightly gritty.


 ""Uh-huh!"" I said, smiling. Anders just stared at me.


 I turned to the storage lockers. ""Let's see this junk they were
 suddenly deprived of.""


 Anders, after a puzzled frown, obediently threw open the doors of
 the riveted tiers of metal boxes along the rear wall; the wall next
 to the firing chambers, which I had no particular desire to visit. I
 glanced inside at the articles therein, and noted with interest their
 similarity.


 ""Now, then,"" I resumed, ""the thrust of this rocket to get from Mars to
 Earth is calculated with regard to the mass on board, is that correct?""
 He nodded. ""Good, that clears up an important point. I'd also like to
 know if this rocket has a dehumidifying system to keep the cast-off
 moisture from the passengers out of the air?""


 ""Well, sure, sir!"" said Anders. ""Otherwise, we'd all be swimming in our
 own sweat after a ten-hour trip across space!""


 ""Have you checked the storage tanks?"" I asked. ""Or is the cast-off
 perspiration simply jetted into space?""


 ""No. It's saved, sir. It gets distilled and stored for washing and
 drinking. Otherwise, we'd all dehydrate, with no water to replace the
 water we lost.""


 ""Check the tanks,"" I said.


 Anders, shaking his head, moved into the pilot's section and looked at
 a dial there. ""Full, sir. But that's because I didn't drink very much,
 and any sweating I did—which was a hell of a lot, in this case—was a
 source of new water for the tanks.""


 ""Uh-huh."" I paused and considered. ""I suppose the tubing for these
 tanks is all over the ship? In all the hollow bulkhead space, to take
 up the moisture fast?""


 Anders, hopelessly lost, could only nod wearily.


 ""Would it hold—"" I did some quick mental arithmetic—""let's say, about
 twenty-four extra cubic feet?""


 He stared, then frowned, and thought hard. ""Yes, sir,"" he said,
 after a minute. ""Even twice that, with no trouble, but—"" He caught
 himself short. It didn't pay to be too curious about the aims of an
 Amnesty-bearer.


 ""It's all right, Anders. You've been a tremendous help. Just one thing.
 When you left Mars, you took off from the night side, didn't you?""


 ""Why, yes, I did, sir. But how did you—?""


 ""No matter, Anders. That'll be all.""


 ""Yes, sir!"" He saluted sharply and started off.


 I started back for Interplanetary Security, and my second—and I hoped,
 last—interview with Chief Baxter. I had a slight inkling why the Brain
 had chosen me; because, in the affair of the missing Space Scouts, my
 infallible talent for spotting the True within the Apparent had come
 through nicely. I had found a very interesting clinker.
4
""Strange,"" I remarked to Chief Baxter when I was seated once again in
 his office, opposite his newly replaced desk. ""I hardly acted like
 myself out at that airfield. I was brusque, highhanded, austere, almost
 malevolent with the pilot. And I'm ordinarily on the shy side, as a
 matter of fact.""


 ""It's the Amnesty that does it,"" he said, gesturing toward the disc. It
 lay on his desk, now, along with the collapser. I felt, with the new
 information I'd garnered, that my work was done, and that the new data
 fed into the Brain would produce some other results, not involving me.


 I looked at the Amnesty, then nodded. ""Kind of gets you, after awhile.
 To know that you are the most influential person in creation is to
 automatically act the part. A shame, in a way.""


 ""The hell it is!"" Baxter snapped. ""Good grief, man, why'd you think the
 Amnesty was created in the first place?""


 I sat up straight and scratched the back of my head. ""Now you mention
 it, I really don't know. It seems a pretty dangerous thing to have
 about, the way people jump when they see it.""


 ""It is dangerous, of course, but it's vitally necessary. You're young,
 Jery Delvin, and even the finest history course available these days
 is slanted in favor of World Government. So you have no idea how tough
 things were before the Amnesty came along. Ever hear of red tape?""


 I shook my head. ""No, I don't believe so. Unless it had something to do
 with the former communist menace? They called themselves the Reds, I
 believe....""


 He waved me silent. ""No connection at all, son. No, red tape was, well,
 involvement. Forms to be signed, certain factors to be considered,
 protocol to be dealt with, government agencies to be checked with,
 classifications, bureaus, sub-bureaus, congressional committees. It
 was impossible, Jery, my boy, to get anything done whatsoever without
 consulting someone else. And the time lag and paperwork involved made
 accurate and swift action impossible, sometimes. What we needed, of
 course, was a person who could simply have all authority, in order to
 save the sometimes disastrous delays. So we came up with the Amnesty.""


 ""But the danger. If you should pick the wrong man—""


 Baxter smiled. ""No chance of that, Jery. We didn't leave it up to any
 committee or bureau or any other faction to do the picking. Hell, that
 would have put us right back where we'd been before. No, we left it up
 to the Brain. We'd find ourselves in a tight situation, and the Brain
 after being fed the data, would come up with either a solution, or a
 name.""


 I stared at him. ""Then, when I was here before, I was here solely to
 receive the Amnesty, is that it?""


 Baxter nodded. ""The Brain just picks the men. Then we tell the men the
 situation, hand over the Amnesty, and pray.""


 I had a sudden thought. ""Say, what happens if two men are selected by
 the Brain? Who has authority over whom?""


 Baxter grimaced and shivered. ""Don't even think such a thing! Even
 your mentioning such a contingency gives me a small migraine. It'd be
 unprecedented in the history of the Brain or the Amnesty."" He grinned,
 suddenly. ""Besides, it can't happen. There's only one of these—"" he
 tapped the medallion gently ""—in existence, Jery. So we couldn't have
 such a situation!""


 I sank back into the contour chair, and glanced at my watch. Much too
 late to go back to work. I'd done a lot in one day, I reasoned. Well,
 the thing was out of my hands. Baxter had the information I'd come
 up with, and it had been coded and fed to the Brain. As soon as the
 solution came through, I could be on my way back to the world of hard
 and soft sell.


 ""You understand,"" said Baxter suddenly, ""that you're to say nothing
 whatever about the disappearance of the Space Scouts until this office
 makes the news public? You know what would happen if this thing should
 leak!""


 The intercom on Baxter's desk suddenly buzzed, and a bright red light
 flashed on. ""Ah!"" he said, thumbing a knob. ""Here we go, at last!""


 As he exerted pressure on the knob, a thin slit in the side of the
 intercom began feeding out a long sheet of paper; the new answer from
 the Brain. It reached a certain length, then was automatically sheared
 off within the intercom, and the sheet fell gently to the desktop.
 Baxter picked it up and swiftly scanned its surface. A look of dismay
 overrode his erstwhile genial features.


 I had a horrible suspicion. ""Not again?"" I said softly.


 Baxter swore under his breath. Then he reached across the desktop and
 tossed me the Amnesty.

By CARL JACOBI
Grannie Annie, who wrote science fiction

 under the nom de plume of Annabella C. Flowers,

 had stumbled onto a murderous plot more

 hair-raising than any she had ever concocted.

 And the danger from the villain of the piece

 didn't worry her—I was the guy he was shooting at.

I was killing an hour in the billiard room of the
Spacemen's Club
in Swamp City when the Venusian bellboy came and tapped me on the
 shoulder.


 ""Beg pardon, thir,"" he said with his racial lisp, ""thereth thome one to
 thee you in the main lounge."" His eyes rolled as he added, ""A lady!""


 A woman here...! The
Spacemen's
was a sanctuary, a rest club where
 in-coming pilots and crewmen could relax before leaving for another
 voyage. The rule that no females could pass its portals was strictly
 enforced.


 I followed the bellhop down the long corridor that led to the main
 lounge. At the threshold I jerked to a halt and stared incredulously.


 Grannie Annie!


 There she stood before a frantically gesticulating desk clerk, leaning
 on her faded green umbrella. A little wisp of a woman clad in a
 voluminous black dress with one of those doily-like caps on her head,
 tied by a ribbon under her chin. Her high-topped button shoes were
 planted firmly on the varpla carpet and her wrinkled face was set in
 calm defiance.


 I barged across the lounge and seized her hand. ""Grannie Annie! I
 haven't seen you in two years.""


 ""Hi, Billy-boy,"" she greeted calmly. ""Will you please tell this
 fish-face to shut up.""


 The desk clerk went white. ""Mithter Trenwith, if thith lady ith a
 friend of yourth, you'll have to take her away. It'th abtholutely
 againth the ruleth....""


 ""Okay, okay,"" I grinned. ""Look, we'll go into the grille. There's no
 one there at this hour.""


 In the grille an equally astonished waiter served us—me a lime rickey
 and Grannie Annie her usual whisky sour—I waited until she had tossed
 the drink off at a gulp before I set off a chain of questions:


 ""What the devil are you doing on Venus? Don't you know women aren't
 allowed in the
Spacemen's
? What happened to the book you were
 writing?""


 ""Hold it, Billy-boy."" Laughingly she threw up both hands. ""Sure, I knew
 this place had some antiquated laws. Pure fiddle-faddle, that's what
 they are. Anyway, I've been thrown out of better places.""


 She hadn't changed. To her publishers and her readers she might be
 Annabella C. Flowers, author of a long list of science fiction novels.
 But to me she was still Grannie Annie, as old-fashioned as last year's
 hat, as modern as an atomic motor. She had probably written more drivel
 in the name of science fiction than anyone alive.


 But the public loved it. They ate up her stories, and they clamored for
 more. Her annual income totaled into six figures, and her publishers
 sat back and massaged their digits, watching their earnings mount.


 One thing you had to admit about her books. They may have been dime
 novels, but they weren't synthetic. If Annabella C. Flowers wrote a
 novel, and the locale was the desert of Mars, she packed her carpet bag
 and hopped a liner for Craterville. If she cooked up a feud between two
 expeditions on Callisto, she went to Callisto.


 She was the most completely delightful crackpot I had ever known.


 ""What happened to
Guns for Ganymede
?"" I asked. ""That was the title of
 your last, wasn't it?""
Grannie spilled a few shreds of Martian tobacco onto a paper and deftly
 rolled herself a cigarette.


 ""It wasn't
Guns
, it was
Pistols
; and it wasn't
Ganymede
, it was
Pluto
.""


 I grinned. ""All complete, I'll bet, with threats against the universe
 and beautiful Earth heroines dragged in by the hair.""


 ""What else is there in science fiction?"" she demanded. ""You can't have
 your hero fall in love with a bug-eyed monster.""


 Up on the wall a clock chimed the hour. The old woman jerked to her
 feet.


 ""I almost forgot, Billy-boy. I'm due at the
Satellite
Theater in ten
 minutes. Come on, you're going with me.""


 Before I realized it, I was following her through the lounge and out to
 the jetty front. Grannie Annie hailed a hydrocar. Five minutes later we
 drew up before the big doors of the
Satellite
.


 They don't go in for style in Swamp City. A theater to the grizzled
 colonials on this side of the planet meant a shack on stilts over the
 muck,
zilcon
wood seats and dingy atobide lamps. But the place was
 packed with miners, freight-crew-men—all the tide and wash of humanity
 that made Swamp City the frontier post it is.


 In front was a big sign. It read:
ONE NIGHT ONLY

 DOCTOR UNIVERSE AND HIS

 NINE GENIUSES

 THE QUESTION PROGRAM OF

 THE SYSTEM


 As we strode down the aisle a mangy-looking Venusian began to pound a
 tinpan piano in the pit. Grannie Annie pushed me into a seat in the
 front row.


 ""Sit here,"" she said. ""I'm sorry about all this rush, but I'm one of
 the players in this shindig. As soon as the show is over, we'll go
 somewhere and talk."" She minced lightly down the aisle, climbed the
 stage steps and disappeared in the wings.


 ""That damned fossilized dynamo,"" I muttered. ""She'll be the death of me
 yet.""


 The piano struck a chord in G, and the curtain went rattling up. On the
 stage four Earthmen, two Martians, two Venusians, and one Mercurian
 sat on an upraised dais. That is to say, eight of them sat. The
 Mercurian, a huge lump of granite-like flesh, sprawled there, palpably
 uncomfortable. On the right were nine visi sets, each with its new
 improved pantascope panel and switchboard. Before each set stood an
 Earthman operator.
A tall man, clad in a claw-hammer coat, came out from the wings and
 advanced to the footlights.


 ""People of Swamp City,"" he said, bowing, ""permit me to introduce
 myself. I am Doctor Universe, and these are my nine experts.""


 There was a roar of applause from the
Satellite
audience. When it had
 subsided, the man continued:


 ""As most of you are familiar with our program, it will be unnecessary
 to give any advance explanation. I will only say that on this stage are
 nine visi sets, each tuned to one of the nine planets. At transmitting
 sets all over these planets listeners will appear and voice questions.
 These questions, my nine experts will endeavor to answer. For every
 question missed, the sender will receive a check for one thousand
planetoles
.


 ""One thing more. As usual we have with us a guest star who will match
 her wits with the experts. May I present that renowned writer of
 science fiction, Annabella C. Flowers.""


 From the left wing Grannie Annie appeared. She bowed and took her place
 on the dais.


 The Doctor's program began. The operator of the Earth visi twisted his
 dials and nodded. Blue light flickered on the pantascope panel to
 coalesce slowly into the face of a red-haired man. Sharp and dear his
 voice echoed through the theater:


 ""
Who was the first Earthman to titter the sunward side of Mercury?
""


 Doctor Universe nodded and turned to Grannie Annie who had raised her
 hand. She said quietly:


 ""Charles Zanner in the year 2012. In a specially constructed
 tracto-car.""


 And so it went. Questions from Mars, from Earth, from Saturn flowed in
 the visi sets. Isolated miners on Jupiter, dancers in swank Plutonian
 cafes strove to stump the experts. With Doctor Universe offering
 bantering side play, the experts gave their answers. When they failed,
 or when the Truthicator flashed a red light, he announced the name of
 the winner.


 It grew a little tiresome after a while and I wondered why Grannie had
 brought me here. And then I began to notice things.


 The audience in the
Satellite
seemed to have lost much of its
 original fervor. They applauded as before but they did so only at the
 signal of Doctor Universe. The spell created by the man was complete.


 Pompous and erect, he strode back and forth across the stage like a
 general surveying his army. His black eyes gleamed, and his thin lips
 were turned in a smile of satisfaction.


 When the last question had been answered I joined the exit-moving
 crowd. It was outside under the street marquee that a strange incident
 occurred.


 A yellow-faced Kagor from the upper Martian desert country shuffled by,
 dragging his cumbersome third leg behind him. Kagors, of course, had an
 unpleasant history of persecution since the early colonization days of
 the Red Planet. But the thing that happened there was a throw back to
 an earlier era.


 Someone shouted, ""Yah, yellow-face! Down with all Kagors!"" As one
 man the crowd took up the cry and surged forward. The helpless Kagor
 was seized and flung to the pavement. A knife appeared from nowhere,
 snipped the Martian's single lock of hair. A booted foot bludgeoned
 into his mouth.


 Moments later an official hydrocar roared up and a dozen I.P. men
 rushed out and scattered the crowd. But a few stragglers lingered to
 shout derisive epithets.


 Grannie Annie came out from behind the box office then. She took my arm
 and led me around a corner and through a doorway under a sign that read
 THE JET. Inside was a deep room with booths along one wall. The place
 was all but deserted.


 In a booth well toward the rear the old lady surveyed me with sober
 eyes.


 ""Billy-boy, did you see the way that crowd acted?""


 I nodded. ""As disgraceful an exhibition as I've ever seen. The I.P. men
 ought to clamp down.""


 ""The I.P. men aren't strong enough.""


 She said it quietly, but there was a glitter in her eyes and a harsh
 line about her usually smiling lips.


 ""What do you mean?""
For a moment the old lady sat there in silence; then she leaned back,
 closed her eyes, and I knew there was a story coming.


 ""My last book,
Death In The Atom
, hit the stands last January,""
 she began. ""When it was finished I had planned to take a six months'
 vacation, but those fool publishers of mine insisted I do a sequel.
 Well, I'd used Mars and Pluto and Ganymede as settings for novels, so
 for this one I decided on Venus. I went to Venus City, and I spent six
 weeks in-country. I got some swell background material, and I met Ezra
 Karn....""


 ""Who?"" I interrupted.


 ""An old prospector who lives out in the deep marsh on the outskirts of
 Varsoom country. To make a long story short, I got him talking about
 his adventures, and he told me plenty.""


 The old woman paused. ""Did you ever hear of the Green Flames?"" she
 asked abruptly.


 I shook my head. ""Some new kind of ...""


 ""It's not a new kind of anything. The Green Flame is a radio-active
 rock once found on Mercury. The
Alpha
rays of this rock are similar
 to radium in that they consist of streams of material particles
 projected at high speed. But the character of the
Gamma
rays has
 never been completely analyzed. Like those set up by radium, they are
 electromagnetic pulsations, but they are also a strange combination of
Beta
or cathode rays with negatively charged electrons.


 ""When any form of life is exposed to these
Gamma
rays from the Green
 Flame rock, they produce in the creature's brain a certain lassitude
 and lack of energy. As the period of exposure increases, this condition
 develops into a sense of impotence and a desire for leadership or
 guidance. Occasionally, as with the weak-willed, there is a spirit of
 intolerance. The Green Flames might be said to be an inorganic opiate,
 a thousand times more subtle and more powerful than any known drug.""


 I was sitting up now, hanging on to the woman's every word.


 ""Now in 2710, as you'd know if you studied your history, the three
 planets of Earth, Venus, and Mars were under governmental bondage. The
 cruel dictatorship of Vennox I was short-lived, but it lasted long
 enough to endanger all civilized life.


 ""The archives tell us that one of the first acts of the overthrowing
 government was to cast out all Green Flames, two of which Vennox had
 ordered must be kept in each household. The effect on the people was
 immediate. Representative government, individual enterprise, freedom
 followed.""


 Grannie Annie lit a cigarette and flipped the match to the floor.


 ""To go back to my first trip to Venus. As I said, I met Ezra Karn, an
 old prospector there in the marsh. Karn told me that on one of his
 travels into the Varsoom district he had come upon the wreckage of
 an old space ship. The hold of that space ship was packed with Green
 Flames!""


 If Grannie expected me to show surprise at that, she was disappointed.
 I said, ""So what?""


 ""So everything, Billy-boy. Do you realize what such a thing would mean
 if it were true? Green Flames were supposedly destroyed on all planets
 after the Vennox regime crashed. If a quantity of the rock were in
 existence, and it fell into the wrong hands, there'd be trouble.


 ""Of course, I regarded Karn's story as a wild dream, but it made
 corking good story material. I wrote it into a novel, and a week after
 it was completed, the manuscript was stolen from my study back on
 Earth.""


 ""I see,"" I said as she lapsed into silence. ""And now you've come to the
 conclusion that the details of your story were true and that someone is
 attempting to put your plot into action.""


 Grannie nodded. ""Yes,"" she said. ""That's exactly what I think.""


 I got my pipe out of my pocket, tamped Martian tobacco into the bowl
 and laughed heartily. ""The same old Flowers,"" I said. ""Tell me, who's
 your thief ... Doctor Universe?""


 She regarded me evenly. ""What makes you say that?""


 I shrugged.


 ""The way the theater crowd acted. It all ties in.""


 The old woman shook her head. ""No, this is a lot bigger than a simple
 quiz program. The theater crowd was but a cross-section of what is
 happening all over the System. There have been riots on Earth and Mars,
 police officials murdered on Pluto and a demand that government by
 representation be abolished on Jupiter. The time is ripe for a military
 dictator to step in.


 ""And you can lay it all to the Green Flames. It seems incredible that a
 single shipload of the ore could effect such a wide ranged area, but in
 my opinion someone has found a means of making that quantity a thousand
 times more potent and is transmiting it
en masse
.""


 If it had been anyone but Grannie Annie there before me, I would
 have called her a fool. And then all at once I got an odd feeling of
 approaching danger.


 ""Let's get out of here,"" I said, getting up.
Zinnng-whack!
""All right!""


 On the mirror behind the bar a small circle with radiating cracks
 appeared. On the booth wall a scant inch above Grannie's head the
 fresco seemed to melt away suddenly.


 A heat ray!


 Grannie Annie leaped to her feet, grasped my arm and raced for the
 door. Outside a driverless hydrocar stood with idling motors. The old
 woman threw herself into the control seat, yanked me in after her and
 threw over the starting stud.


 An instant later we were plunging through the dark night.
Six days after leaving Swamp City we reached Level Five, the last
 outpost of firm ground. Ahead lay the inner marsh, stretching as far as
 the eye could reach. Low islands projected at intervals from the thick
 water. Mold balls, two feet across, drifted down from the slate-gray
 sky like puffs of cotton.


 We had traveled this far by
ganet
, the tough little two headed pack
 animal of the Venus hinterland. Any form of plane or rocket would have
 had its motor instantly destroyed, of course, by the magnetic force
 belt that encircled the planet's equator. Now our drivers changed to
 boatmen, and we loaded our supplies into three clumsy
jagua
canoes.


 It was around the camp fire that night that Grannie took me into her
 confidence for the first time since we had left Swamp City.


 ""We're heading directly for Varsoom country,"" she said. ""If we find
 Ezra Karn so much the better. If we don't, we follow his directions to
 the lost space ship. Our job is to find that ore and destroy it. You
 see, I'm positive the Green Flames have never been removed from the
 ship.""


 Sleep had never bothered me, yet that night I lay awake for hours
 tossing restlessly. The thousand sounds of the blue marsh droned
 steadily. And the news broadcast I had heard over the portable visi
 just before retiring still lingered in my mind. To a casual observer
 that broadcast would have meant little, a slight rebellion here, an
 isolated crime there. But viewed from the perspective Grannie had
 given me, everything dovetailed. The situation on Jupiter was swiftly
 coming to a head. Not only had the people on that planet demanded that
 representative government be abolished, but a forum was now being held
 to find a leader who might take complete dictatorial control.


 Outside a whisper-worm hissed softly. I got up and strode out of my
 tent. For some time I stood there, lost in thought. Could I believe
 Grannie's incredible story? Or was this another of her fantastic plots
 which she had skilfully blended into a novel?


 Abruptly I stiffened. The familiar drone of the marsh was gone. In its
 place a ringing silence blanketed everything.


 And then out in the gloom a darker shadow appeared, moving in
 undulating sweeps toward the center of the camp. Fascinated, I watched
 it advance and retreat, saw two hyalescent eyes swim out of the murk.
 It charged, and with but a split second to act, I threw myself flat.
 There was a rush of mighty wings as the thing swept over me. Sharp
 talons raked my clothing. Again it came, and again I rolled swiftly,
 missing the thing by the narrowest of margins.


 From the tent opposite a gaunt figure clad in a familiar dress
 appeared. Grannie gave a single warning:


 ""Stand still!""


 The thing in the darkness turned like a cam on a rod and drove at us
 again. This time the old woman's heat gun clicked, and a tracery of
 purple flame shot outward. A horrible soul-chilling scream rent the
 air. A moment later something huge and heavy scrabbled across the
 ground and shot aloft.
Grannie Annie fired with deliberate speed.
I stood frozen as the diminuendo of its wild cries echoed back to me.


 ""In heaven's name, what was it?""


 ""Hunter-bird,"" Grannie said calmly. ""A form of avian life found here
 in the swamp. Harmless in its wild state, but when captured, it can be
 trained to pursue a quarry until it kills. It has a single unit brain
 and follows with a relentless purpose.""


 ""Then that would mean...?""


 ""That it was sent by our enemy, the same enemy that shot at us in the
 cafe in Swamp City. Exactly."" Grannie Annie halted at the door of her
 tent and faced me with earnest eyes. ""Billy-boy, our every move is
 being watched. From now on it's the survival of the fittest.""
The following day was our seventh in the swamp. The water here
 resembled a vast mosaic, striped and cross-striped with long winding
 ribbons of yellowish substance that floated a few inches below the
 surface. The mold balls coming into contact with the evonium water of
 the swamp had undergone a chemical change and evolved into a cohesive
 multi-celled marine life that lived and died within a space of hours.
 The Venusians paddled with extreme care. Had one of them dipped his
 hand into one of those yellow streaks, he would have been devoured in
 a matter of seconds.


 At high noon by my Earth watch I sighted a low white structure on one
 of the distant islands. Moments later we made a landing at a rude
 jetty, and Grannie Annie was introducing me to Ezra Karn.


 He was not as old a man as I had expected, but he was ragged and
 unkempt with iron gray hair falling almost to his shoulders. He was
 dressed in
varpa
cloth, the Venus equivalent of buckskin, and on his
 head was an enormous flop-brimmed hat.


 ""Glad to meet you,"" he said, shaking my hand. ""Any friend of Miss
 Flowers is a friend of mine."" He ushered us down the catwalk into his
 hut.


 The place was a two room affair, small but comfortable. The latest
 type of visi set in one corner showed that Karn was not isolated from
 civilization entirely.


 Grannie Annie came to the point abruptly. When she had explained the
 object of our trip, the prospector became thoughtful.


 ""Green Flames, eh?"" he repeated slowly. ""Well yes, I suppose I could
 find that space ship again. That is, if I wanted to.""


 ""What do you mean?"" Grannie paused in the act of rolling herself a
 cigarette. ""You know where it is, don't you?""


 ""Ye-s,"" Karn nodded. ""But like I told you before, that ship lies in
 Varsoom country, and that isn't exactly a summer vacation spot.""


 ""What are the Varsoom?"" I asked. ""A native tribe?""


 Karn shook his head. ""They're a form of life that's never been seen by
 Earthmen. Strictly speaking, they're no more than a form of energy.""


 ""Dangerous?""


 ""Yes and no. Only man I ever heard of who escaped their country outside
 of myself was the explorer, Darthier, three years ago. I got away
 because I was alone, and they didn't notice me, and Darthier escaped
 because he made 'em laugh.""


 ""Laugh?"" A scowl crossed Grannie's face.


 ""That's right,"" Karn said. ""The Varsoom have a strange nervous reaction
 that's manifested by laughing. But just what it is that makes them
 laugh, I don't know.""


 Food supplies and fresh drinking water were replenished at the hut.
 Several mold guns were borrowed from the prospector's supply to arm the
 Venusians. And then as we were about to leave, Karn suddenly turned.


 ""The Doctor Universe program,"" he said. ""I ain't missed one in months.
 You gotta wait 'til I hear it.""


 Grannie frowned in annoyance, but the prospector was adamant. He
 flipped a stud, twisted a dial and a moment later was leaning back in a
 chair, listening with avid interest.


 It was the same show I had witnessed back in Swamp City. Once again I
 heard questions filter in from the far outposts of the System. Once
 again I saw the commanding figure of the quiz master as he strode back
 and forth across the stage. And as I sat there, looking into the visi
 screen, a curious numbing drowsiness seemed to steal over me and lead
 my thoughts far away.
Half an hour later we headed into the unknown. The Venusian boatmen
 were ill-at-ease now and jabbered among themselves constantly. We
 camped that night on a miserable little island where insects swarmed
 about us in hordes. The next day an indefinable wave of weariness and
 despondency beset our entire party. I caught myself musing over the
 futility of the venture. Only the pleadings of Grannie Annie kept me
 from turning back. On the morrow I realized the truth in her warning,
 that all of us had been exposed to the insidious radiations.


 After that I lost track of time. Day after day of incessant rain ... of
 steaming swamp.... But at length we reached firm ground and began our
 advance on foot.


 It was Karn who first sighted the ship. Striding in the lead, he
 suddenly halted at the top of a hill and leveled his arm before him.
 There it lay, a huge cigar-shaped vessel of blackened
arelium
steel,
 half buried in the swamp soil.


 ""What's that thing on top?"" Karn demanded, puzzled.


 A rectangular metal envelope had been constructed over the stern
 quarters of the ship. Above this structure were three tall masts. And
 suspended between them was a network of copper wire studded with white
 insulators.


 Grannie gazed a long moment through binoculars. ""Billy-boy, take three
 Venusians and head across the knoll,"" she ordered. ""Ezra and I will
 circle in from the west. Fire a gun if you strike trouble.""


 But we found no trouble. The scene before us lay steeped in silence.
 Moments later our two parties converged at the base of the great ship.


 A metal ladder extended from the envelope down the side of the vessel.
 Mid-way we could see a circular hatch-like door.


 ""Up we go, Billy-boy."" Heat gun in readiness, Grannie Annie began to
 climb slowly.


 The silence remained absolute. We reached the door and pulled it open.
 There was no sign of life.


 ""Somebody's gone to a lot of trouble here,"" Ezra Karn observed.


 Somebody had. Before us stretched a narrow corridor, flanked on the
 left side by a wall of impenetrable stepto glass. The corridor was
 bare of furnishings. But beyond the glass, revealed to us in mocking
 clarity, was a high panel, studded with dials and gauges. Even as we
 looked, we could see liquid pulse in glass tubes, indicator needles
 swing slowly to and fro.


 Grannie nodded. ""Some kind of a broadcasting unit. The Green Flames in
 the lower hold are probably exposed to a
tholpane
plate and their
 radiations stepped up by an electro-phosicalic process.""


 Karn raised the butt of his pistol and brought it crashing against the
 glass wall. His arm jumped in recoil, but the glass remained intact.


 ""You'll never do it that way,"" Grannie said. ""Nothing short of an
 atomic blast will shatter that wall. It explains why there are no
 guards here. The mechanism is entirely self-operating. Let's see if the
 Green Flames are more accessible.""


 In the lower hold disappointment again confronted us. Visible in
 the feeble shafts of daylight that filtered through cracks in the
 vessel's hull were tiers of rectangular ingots of green iridescent ore.
 Suspended by insulators from the ceiling over them was a thick metal
 plate.


 But between was a barrier. A wall of impenetrable stepto glass.


 Grannie stamped her foot. ""It's maddening,"" she said. ""Here we are at
 the crux of the whole matter, and we're powerless to make a single
 move.""

BY MICHAEL ZUROY
Here's why you should ask for
 
a ""Feetch M-D"" next time
 
you get a can opener!

""Feetch!"" grated Ogden Piltdon, president of the Piltdon Opener
 Company, slamming the drafting board with his hairy fist, ""I want
 results!""


 Heads lifted over boards. Kalvin Feetch shrunk visibly.


 ""As chief engineer you're not carrying the ball,"" Piltdon went on
 savagely. ""The Piltdon Can-Opener is trailing the competition.
 Advertising and Sales are breaking their necks. It's Engineering
 that's missing the boat!""


 ""But Mr. Piltdon,"" remonstrated Feetch unsteadily under his employer's
 glare, ""don't you remember? I tried to....""


 ""For two years there hasn't been one lousy improvement in the Piltdon
 Can-Opener!"" roared Mr. Piltdon. ""Look at our competitors. The
 International rips apart cans in three and three-tenths seconds.
 Universal does it in four.""


 ""But Mr. Piltdon—""


 ""The Minerva Mighty Midget does it in four point two two and plays Home
 Sweet Home in chimes. Our own Piltdon opener barely manages to open a
 can in eight point nine without chimes. Is this what I'm paying you
 for?""


 Feetch adjusted his spectacles with shaking hands. ""But Mr. Piltdon,
 our opener still has stability, solidity. It is built to last. It has
 dignity....""


 ""Dignity,"" pronounced Piltdon, ""is for museums. Four months, Feetch!
 In four months I want a new can-opener that will be faster, lighter,
 stronger, flashier and more musical than any other on the market. I
 want it completely developed, engineered and tooled-up, ready for
 production. Otherwise, Feetch—""


 Feetch's body twitched. ""But Mr. Piltdon, four months is hardly time
 enough for development, even with an adequate staff. I've been trying
 to tell you for years that we're bound to fall behind because we don't
 have enough personnel to conduct research. Our men can barely keep
 up with production and maintenance. If you would let me put on a few
 draftsmen and....""


 ""Excuses,"" sneered Mr. Piltdon. ""Your staff is more than adequate.
 I will not allow you to throw out my money. Four months, Feetch,
 no more!"" Piltdon trudged out of the room, leaving behind him an
 oppressive silence.


 How could you set a time limit on research and development? A designer
 had to dream at his board, investigate, search, build, test, compare,
 discard. He had always wanted to devote all his time to research, but
 Piltdon Opener had not given him that opportunity. Twenty-five years!
 thought Feetch. Twenty-five years of close supervision, dead-lines,
 production headaches, inadequate facilities and assistance. What had
 happened, to the proud dream he once had, the dream of exploring
 uncharted engineering regions, of unlimited time to investigate and
 develop?


 Ah, well, thought Feetch straightening his thin shoulders, he had
 managed somehow to design a few good things during his twenty-five
 years with Piltdon. That was some satisfaction.


 What now? He had to hang on to his job. Technical work was scarce.
 Since the early 1980's the schools had been turning out more
 technicians than industry could absorb. He was too old to compete in
 the employment market. He couldn't afford to lose any money. Jenny
 wasn't well.


 How to meet this four month dead-line? He would get right on it
 himself, of course; Hanson—good man—could work with him. He shook his
 head despairingly. Something would be sure to blow up. Well, he had to
 start—
""Chief,"" said Hanson a few weeks later as they entered the lab, ""I'm
 beginning to wonder if the answer is in the hand mechanical type at
 all.""


 ""Got to be,"" answered Feetch tiredly. ""We must work along classical
 can-opener lines. Departures, such as the thermal or motor-driven
 types, would be too expensive for mass production.""


 Three new models and a group of cans were waiting for them on the
 bench. They began testing, Hanson operating the openers and Feetch
 clocking. ""Four point four,"" announced Feetch after the last test.
 ""Good, but not good enough. Too bulky. Appearance unsatisfactory.
 Chimes tinny. We've made progress, but we've a long way to go.""


 The problem was tricky. It might seem that use of the proper gear
 ratios would give the required velocity, but there were too many
 other factors that negated this direct approach. The mechanism had to
 be compact and streamlined. Gear sizes had to be kept down. Can-top
 resistance, internal resistance, cutting tooth performance, handle
 size and moment, the minimum strength of a woman's hand were some of
 the variables that had to be balanced within rigid limits. Sector
 type cutters, traversing several arcs at the same time, had seemed to
 offer the answer for a while, but the adjusting mechanism necessary to
 compensate for variable can sizes had been too complex to be practical.
 There was the ever-present limit to production cost.


 Hanson's eyes were upon him. ""Chief,"" he said, ""it's a rotten shame.
 Twenty-five years of your life you put in with Piltdon, and he'd fire
 you just like that if you don't do the impossible. The Piltdon Company
 is built upon your designs and you get handed this deal!""


 ""Well, well,"" said Feetch. ""I drew my pay every week so I suppose I
 have no complaints. Although,"" a wistful note crept into his voice ""I
 would have liked a little recognition. Piltdon is a household word,
 but who has heard of Feetch? Well,""—Feetch blew his nose—""how do we
 stand, Hanson?""


 Hanson's bull-dog features drew into a scowl. ""Piltdon ought to
 be rayed,"" he growled. ""O.K., Chief. Eleven experimental models
 designed to date. Two more on the boards. Nine completed and tested,
 two in work. Best performance, four point four, but model otherwise
 unsatisfactory.""


 ""Hello,"" said Feetch as an aproned machinist entered carrying a
 glistening mechanism. ""Here's another model. Let's try it."" The
 machinist departed and Hanson locked the opener on a can. ""I hope——""
 he turned the handle, and stopped abruptly, staring down open-mouthed.


 A cylinder of close-packed beans rested on the bench under the opener.


 The can itself had disappeared.


 ""Chief,"" said Hanson. ""Chief.""


 ""Yes,"" said Feetch. ""I see it too. Try another can.""


 ""Vegetable soup or spinach?"" inquired Hanson dreamily.


 ""Spinach, I think,"" said Feetch. ""Where did the can go, do you suppose?""


 The spinach can disappeared. Likewise several corn cans, sweet potato
 cans and corned-beef hash cans, leaving their contents intact. It was
 rather disconcerting.


 ""Dear, dear,"" said Feetch, regarding the piles of food on the bench.
 ""There must be some explanation. I designed this opener with sixteen
 degree, twenty-two minute pressure angle modified involute gear
 teeth, seven degree, nineteen minute front clearance cutter angle and
 thirty-six degree, twelve minute back rake angle. I expected that such
 departures from the norm might achieve unconventional performance, but
 this—Dear, dear. Where do the cans go, I wonder?""


 ""What's the difference? Don't you see what you've got here? It's the
 answer! It's more than the answer! We can put this right into work and
 beat the dead-line.""


 Feetch shook his head. ""No, Hanson. We're producing something we don't
 understand. What forces have we uncovered here? Where do the cans go?
 What makes them disappear? Are we dealing with a kinetic or a kinematic
 effect? What motions can we plot in the area of disappearance and what
 are their analytical mathematical formulae? What masses may be critical
 here? What transformations of energy are involved? No, Hanson, we must
 learn a lot more.""


 ""But Chief, your job.""


 ""I'll risk that. Not a word to Piltdon.""


 Several days later, however, Piltdon himself charged into the drawing
 room and slapped Feetch heartily on the back, causing him to break a
 pencil point. ""Feetch!"" roared Piltdon. ""Is this talk that's going
 around the plant true? Why didn't you tell me? Let's see it.""


 After Piltdon had seen it his eyes took on a feverish glint. ""This,""
 he exulted, ""will make can-opener history. Instantaneous opening!
 Automatic disposal! Wait until Advertising and Sales get hold of this!
 We'll throttle our competitors! The Piltdon Super-Opener we'll call it.""


 ""Mr. Piltdon—"" said Feetch shakily.


 Piltdon stared at his chief engineer sharply. ""What's the matter,
 Feetch? The thing can be duplicated, can't it?""


 ""Yes, sir. I've just finished checking that. But I'm in the midst of
 further investigation of the effect. There's more here than just a new
 type can-opener, sir. A whole new field of physics. New principles.
 This is big, Mr. Piltdon. I recommend that we delay production until
 further research can be completed. Hire a few top scientists and
 engineers. Find out where the cans go. Put out a scientific paper on
 the effect.""


 ""Feetch,"" bit out Piltdon, his face growing hard. ""Stow this hooey. I
 don't give a damn where the cans go. May I remind you that under our
 standard patent agreement, all rights to your invention belong to the
 company? As well as anything you may produce in the field within a year
 after leaving our employ? We have a good thing here, and I don't want
 you holding it back. We're going into production immediately.""
Close, thought Feetch, wearily. It had been a man-killing job, and it
 had been close, but he'd made it. Beat the time limit by a half-day.
 The first tentative shipments of Piltdon Super-Openers had gone to
 distributors along the Eastern seaboard. The first advertisements
 blazed in selected media. The first reorders came back, and then: ""It's
 a sell-out!"" crowed Piltdon, waving a sheaf of telegrams. ""Step up
 production! Let 'er rip!""


 The Super-Openers rolled over the country. In a remarkably short time
 they appeared in millions of kitchens from coast-to-coast. Sales
 climbed to hundreds of thousands per day. Piltdon Opener went into
 peak production in three shifts, but was still unable to keep up with
 the demand. Construction was begun on a new plant, and additional
 plants were planned. Long lines waited in front of houseware stores.
 Department stores, lucky enough to have Super-Openers on hand, limited
 sales to one to a customer. Piltdon cancelled his advertising program.
 Newspapers, magazines, radio, television and word-of-mouth spread the
 fame of the opener so that advertising was unnecessary.


 Meanwhile, of course, government scientists, research foundations,
 universities and independent investigators began to look into this new
 phenomonen. Receiving no satisfactory explanation from Piltdon, they
 set up their own research.


 Far into the night burned the lights of countless laboratories. Noted
 physicists probed, measured, weighed, traced, X-rayed, dissolved,
 spun, peered at, photographed, magnetized, exploded, shattered and
 analyzed Super-Openers without achieving the glimmer of a satisfactory
 explanation. Competitors found the patent impossible to circumvent, for
 any departure from its exact specifications nullified the effect.


 Piltdon, genial these days with success and acclaim, roared at Feetch:
 ""I'm putting you in for a raise. Yes sir! To reward you for assisting
 me with my invention I'm raising your pay two hundred dollars a year.
 That's almost four dollars a week, man.""


 ""Thank you, Mr. Piltdon."" And still, thought Feetch wryly, he received
 no recognition. His name did not even appear on the patent. Well,
 well, that was the way it went. He must find his satisfaction in his
 work. And it had been interesting lately, the work he had been doing
 nights at home investigating what had been named the Piltdon Effect.
 It had been difficult, working alone and buying his own equipment. The
 oscillator and ultra microwave tracking unit had been particularly
 expensive. He was a fool, he supposed, to try independent research when
 so many huge scientific organizations were working on it. But he could
 no more keep away from it than he could stop eating.


 He still didn't know where the cans went, but somehow he felt that he
 was close to the answer.


 When he finally found the answer, it was too late. The Borenchuck
 incident was only hours away.


 As soon as he could get hold of Piltdon, Feetch said trembling, ""Sir, I
 think I know where those cans are going. I recommend—""


 ""Are you still worrying about that?"" Piltdon roared jovially. ""Leave
 that to the long-hairs. We're making money, that's all that counts, eh
 Feetch?""
That night, at six-ten p.m., the Borenchuck family of Selby, South
 Dakota, sat down to their evening meal. Just as they started in on the
 soup, a rain of empty tin cans clattered down, splashed into the soup,
 raised a welt on the forehead of Borenchuck senior, settled down to a
 gentle, steady klunk! klunk! klunk! and inexorably began to pile up on
 the dining-room floor. They seemed to materialize from a plane just
 below the ceiling. The police called the fire department and the fire
 department stared helplessly and recommended the sanitation department.
The incident made headlines in the local papers.


 The next day other local papers in widely scattered locations reported
 similar incidents.


 The following day, cans began falling on Chicago. St. Louis was next,
 and then over the entire nation the cans began to rain down. They fell
 outdoors and indoors, usually materializing at heights that were not
 dangerous. The deluge followed no pattern. Sometimes it would slacken,
 sometimes it would stop, sometimes begin heavily again. It fell in
 homes, on the streets, in theatres, trains, ships, universities and
 dog-food factories. No place was immune.


 People took to wearing hats indoors and out, and the sale of helmets
 boomed.


 All activity was seriously curtailed.


 A state of national emergency was declared.


 Government investigators went to work and soon confirmed what was
 generally suspected: these were the same cans that had been opened by
 the Piltdon Super-Opener.


 Statisticians and mathematicians calculated the mean rate of can
 precipitation and estimated that if all the cans opened by Piltdon
 openers were to come back, the deluge should be over in fifteen point
 twenty-nine days.


 Super-Opener sales of course immediately plummeted to zero and stayed
 there. Anti-Piltdon editorials appeared in the papers. Commentators
 accused Piltdon of deliberately hoaxing the public for his own gain. A
 Congressional investigation was demanded. Piltdon received threats of
 bodily injury. Lawsuits were filed against him. He barricaded himself
 in the plant, surrounded by bodyguards.


 Livid with fury and apprehension, he screamed at Feetch, ""This is your
 doing, you vandal! I'm a ruined man!"" A falling can caught him neatly
 on the tip of his nose.


 ""But sir,"" trembled Feetch, dodging three spaghetti cans, ""I tried to
 warn you.""


 ""You're through, Feetch!"" raved Piltdon. ""Fired! Get out! But before
 you go, I want you to know that I've directed the blame where it
 belongs. I've just released to the press the truth about who created
 the Super-Opener. Now, get out!""


 ""Yes, sir,"" said Feetch paling. ""Then you don't want to hear about my
 discovery of a way to prevent the cans from coming back?""


 Klunk! A barrage of cans hit the floor, and both men took refuge under
 Piltdon's huge desk. ""No!"" yelled Piltdon at Feetch's face which was
 inches away. ""No, I——What did you say?""


 ""A small design improvement sir, and the cans would disappear forever.""


 Klunk!


 ""Forever, Feetch?""


 ""Yes sir."" Klunk! Klunk!


 ""You're positive, Feetch?"" Piltdon's eyes glared into Feetch's.


 ""Sir, I never make careless claims.""


 ""That's true,"" said Piltdon. His eyes grew dreamy. ""It can be done,""
 he mused. ""The New Type Super-Opener. Free exchanges for the old.
 Cash guarantee that empty cans will never bother you. Take a licking
 at first, but then monopolize the market. All right, Feetch, I'll
 give you another chance. You'll turn over all the details to me. The
 patent on the improvement will naturally be mine. I'll get the credit
 for rectifying your blunder. Fine, fine. We'll work it out. Hop on
 production, at once, Feetch.""


 Feetch felt himself sag inwardly. ""Mr. Piltdon,"" he said. ""I'm asking
 only one favor. Let me work full time on research and development,
 especially on the Piltdon effect. Hire a couple of extra men to help
 with production. I assure you the company will benefit in the end.""


 ""Damn it, no!"" roared Piltdon. ""How many times must I tell you? You got
 your job back, didn't you?""


 The prospect of long years of heavy production schedules, restricted
 engineering and tight supervision suddenly made Kalvin Feetch feel
 very tired. Research, he thought. Development. What he had always
 wanted. Over the years he had waited, thinking that there would be
 opportunities later. But now he was growing older, and he felt that
 there might not be a later. Somehow he would manage to get along.
 Perhaps someone would give him a job working in the new field he had
 pioneered. With a sense of relief he realized that he had made his
 decision.


 ""Mr. Piltdon,"" Feetch said. ""I—"" klunk!—""resign.""


 Piltdon started, extreme astonishment crossing his face.


 ""No use,"" said Feetch. ""Nothing you can say—"" klunk! klunk!
 klunk!—""will make any difference now.""


 ""But see here, the New Type Super-Opener...!""


 ""Will remain my secret. Good day.""


 ""Feetch!"" howled Piltdon. ""I order you to remain!""


 Feetch almost submitted from force of habit. He hesitated for a moment,
 then turned abruptly.


 ""Good-day,"" said Feetch firmly, sprinting through the falling cans to
 the door.
Money, Feetch decided after a while, was a good thing to have. His
 supply was running pretty low. He was not having any luck finding
 another job. Although the cans had stopped falling on the fifteenth
 day, as predicted by the statisticians, industry would not soon forget
 the inconvenience and losses caused by the deluge. It was not anxious
 to hire the man it regarded as responsible for the whole thing.
 ""Feetch,"" the personnel man would read. ""Kalvin Feetch."" Then, looking
 up, ""Not the Kalvin Feetch who—""


 ""Yes,"" Feetch would admit miserably.


 ""I am sorry, but—""


 He did no better with research organizations. Typical was a letter
 from the Van Terrel Foundation: ""—cannot accept your application
 inasmuch as we feel your premature application of your discovery to
 profit-making denotes a lack of scientific responsibility and ethics
 not desirable in a member of our organization—former employer states
 the decision was yours entirely. Unfavorable reference—""


 Piltdon, Feetch thought, feeling a strange sensation deep within his
 chest that he had not the experience to recognize as the beginning of a
 slow anger, Piltdon was hitting low and getting away with it.


 Of course, if he were to agree to reveal his latest discoveries to a
 research organization, he would undoubtedly get an appointment. But how
 could he? Everything patentable in his work would automatically revert
 to Piltdon under the one year clause in the company patent agreement.
 No, Feetch told himself, he was revealing nothing that Piltdon might
 grab. The anger began to mount.


 But he was beginning to need money desperately. Jenny wasn't getting
 any better and medical bills were running high.


 The phone rang. Feetch seized it and said to the image: ""Absolutely
 not.""


 ""I'll go up another ten dollars,"" grated the little Piltdon image.
 ""Do you realize, man, this is the fourteenth raise I've offered you?
 A total increase of one hundred and twenty-six dollars? Be sensible,
 Feetch. I know you can't find work anywhere else.""


 ""Thanks to you. Mr. Piltdon, I wouldn't work for you if—""


 A barrage of rocks crashed against the heavy steel screening of the
 window. ""What's going on!"" yelled Piltdon. ""Oh, I see. People throwing
 rocks at your house again? Oh, I know all about that, Feetch. I know
 that you're probably the most unpopular man alive to-day. I know about
 the rocks, the tomatoes, the rotten eggs, the sneaking out at night,
 the disguises you've had to use. Why don't you come back to us and
 change all that, Feetch? We'll put out the New Type Super-Opener and
 the world will soon forget about the old one.""


 ""No,"" said Feetch. ""People will forget anyway—I hope.""


 ""If you won't think of yourself, at least think of your fellow
 workmen,"" begged Piltdon, his voice going blurry. ""Do you realize that
 Piltdon Opener will soon be forced to close down, throwing all your
 former associates out of work? Think of Hanson, Sanchez, Forbes. They
 have families too. Think of the men in the shop, the girls in the
 office, the salesmen on the road. All, all unemployed because of you.
 Think of that, Feetch.""


 Feetch blinked. This had not occurred to him.


 Piltdon eyed him sharply, then smiled with a hint of triumph. ""Think it
 over, Feetch.""


 Feetch sat, thinking it over. Was it right to let all these people lose
 their jobs? Frowning, he dialed Hanson's number.


 ""Chief,"" said Hanson, ""Forget it. The boys are behind you one hundred
 per cent. We'll make out.""


 ""But that's the trouble. I thought you'd feel like this, and I can't
 let you.""


 ""You're beginning to weaken. Don't. Think, chief, think. The brain that
 figured the Super-Opener can solve this.""


 Feetch hung up. A glow of anger that had been building up in his chest
 grew warmer. He began pacing the floor. How he hated to do it. Think,
 Hanson had said. But he had. He's considered every angle, and there was
 no solution.


 Feetch walked into the kitchen and carefully poured himself a drink of
 water. He drank the water slowly and placed the glass on the washstand
 with a tiny click. It was the tiny click that did it. Something about
 it touched off the growing rage. If Piltdon were there he would have
 punched him in the nose. The twenty-five years. The tricks. The threats.


 Think? He'd figured the solution long ago, only he hadn't allowed
 himself to see it. Not lack of brains, lack of guts. Well, he thought
 grimly, dialing Piltdon's number, he was going through with it now.
 ""Piltdon!"" he barked. ""Three p.m. tomorrow. My place. Be here. That's
 all."" He hung up.


 In the same grim mood the following morning, he placed a few more calls.
In the same mood that afternoon he stood in the middle of his
 living-room and looked at his visitors: Piltdon, Williams, the
 Government man; Billings from the Van Terrel Foundation; Steiner of
 Westchester University; the members of the press.


 ""Gentlemen,"" he said. ""I'll make it brief."" He waved the papers in his
 hand. ""Here is everything I know about what I call the Feetch Effect,
 including plans and specifications for the New Type Super-Opener.
 All of you have special reasons for being keenly interested in this
 information. I am now going to give a copy to each of you, providing
 one condition is met by Mr. Piltdon."" He stared at Piltdon. ""In short,
 I want fifty-one per cent of the stock of Piltdon Opener.""


 Piltdon leaped from his chair. ""Outrageous!"" He roared. ""Ridiculous!""


 ""Fifty-one percent,"" said Feetch firmly. ""Don't bother with any
 counterproposals or the interview is at an end.""


 ""Gentlemen!"" squawked Piltdon, ""I appeal to you—""


 ""Stop bluffing,"" said Feetch coldly. ""There's no other way out for
 you. Otherwise you're ruined. Here, sign this agreement.""


 Piltdon threw the paper to the floor and screamed: ""Gentlemen, will you
 be a party to this?""


 ""Well,"" murmured the Government man, ""I never did think Feetch got a
 fair shake.""


 ""This information is important to science,"" said the Van Terrel man.


 After Piltdon had signed, the papers were distributed.


 Published in the newspapers the following day, Feetch's statement read,
 in part: ""The motion in space and time of the singular curvilinear
 proportions of the original Super-Opener combined with the capacitor
 effect built up as it increased its frictional electro-static charge
 in inverse proportion to the cube root of the tolerance between the
 involute teeth caused an instantaneous disruption of what I call the
 Alpha multi-dimensional screen. The can, being metallic, dropped
 through, leaving its non-metallic contents behind. The disruption was
 instantly repaired by the stable nature of the screen.


 ""Beyond the screen is what I call Alpha space, a space apparently quite
 as extensive as our own universe. Unfortunately, as my investigations
 indicated, Alpha space seems to be thickly inhabited. These
 inhabitants, the nature of whom I have not yet ascertained, obviously
 resented the intrusion of the cans, developed a method of disrupting
 the screen from their side, and hurled the cans back at us.


 ""However, I have established the existence of other spaces up to Mu
 space, and suspect that others exist beyond that. Beta space, which is
 also adjacent to our own space, is devoid of any form of life. The New
 Type Super-Opener is designed to pass cans through the Beta screen.
 Beta space will safely absorb an infinite number of cans.


 ""I sincerely and humbly venture the opinion that we are on the
 threshold of tremendous and mighty discoveries. It is my belief that
 possibly an infinite number of universes exist in a type of laminated
 block separated by screens.


 ""Therefore, might it not be that an infinite number of laminated blocks
 exist—?""
""Mr Feetch—"" said Piltdon.


 Feetch looked up from his desk in the newly constructed Feetch
 Multi-Dimensional Development Division of the Piltdon Opener Company.
 ""Piltdon, don't bother me about production. Production is your problem.""


 ""But Mr. Feetch—""


 ""Get out,"" said Feetch.


 Piltdon blanched and left.


 ""As I was saying, Hanson—"" continued Feetch.

misc-freesouls,"Sharism: A Mind Revolution
With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and
 freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner
 dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What
 motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?
 A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social
 capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of
 Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called
 Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it
 in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is
 in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a
 mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to
 transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain.
The Neuron Doctrine
Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many
 pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in
 neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.
 Although we can’t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do
 have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its
 neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,
 electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form
 vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the
 synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by
 sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more
 meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,
 such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons
 work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the
 brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and
 information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas
 and decisions about human networks.
Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has
 profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an
 intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative
 ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The
 idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of
 amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a
 creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,
 you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you
 generate even more ideas in return. It’s a kind of butterfly- effect, as
 the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,
 and the world, more creative.
However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative
 productivity, if only because they’ve switched off their sharing paths.
 People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that
 tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in
 the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and
 not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to
 share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her
 mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative
 choice, her choice will be, “Share.”
These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and
 society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these
 micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result
 in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a
 company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are
 not, what they defend as “cultural goods” and “intellectual property”
 are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much
 of their “culture” will be protected, but the net result is the direct
 loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the
 potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our
 life, which may start to swallow other values as well.
Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private
 and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between
 public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum
 of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable
 creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We
 shouldn’t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing
 private and stay “closed.” They may fear the Internet creates a
 potential for abuse that they can’t fight alone. However, the paradox
 is: The less you share, the less power you have.
New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism
Let’s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer
 bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers
 following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was
 happening, but the rest of the world hadn’t yet realized it. The shift
 toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just
 five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,
 to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to
 the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More
 bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The
 revolution was viral.
Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and
 connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and
 quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete
 gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become
 a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a
 small site, it’s hard to stop. We can’t explain this fact with a theory
 of addiction. It’s an impulse to share. It’s the energy of the memes
 that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It’s more
 than just E-mail. It’s Sharism.
Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in
 mind, by asking themselves, “Who is going to see this?” Bloggers are
 agile in adjusting their tone−and privacy settings−to advance ideas and
 stay out of trouble. It’s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart
 expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into
 the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system
 and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they
 can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how
 Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The
 checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but
 you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a
 box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have
 seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while
 retaining flexible choices.
The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and
 cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to
 another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like
 ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple
 online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a
 result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true
 alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving
 Sharism in our closed culture.
Local Practice, Global Gain
If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural
 setting, it’s hard to get it back. But it’s not impossible. A
 persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of
 Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.
 Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently.
You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and
 returning to a closed mindset. Here’s an idea: put a sticky note on your
 desk that says, “What do you want to share today?” I’m not kidding.
 Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way
 to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social
 software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,
 but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from
 your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it
 might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see
 if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You
 will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive
 results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate
 reward. But there are others.
The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of
 comments. Then you know you’ve provoked interest, appreciation,
 excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being
 shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you
 will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,
 the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the
 third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be
 forwarded, circulated and republished via other people’s networks. This
 cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses.
Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as
 fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You’re
 about to become popular, and fast
This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning
 not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you
 may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This
 one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing
 path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate
 about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of
 development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.
 Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And
 it’s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get
 something just as substantial: Happiness.
The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will
 be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by
 people themselves. Media won’t be controlled by any single person but
 will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These “Shaeros”
 (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first
 wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to
 everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a
 system.
Sharism Safeguards Your Rights
Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in
 new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of
 control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in
 personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said
 that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing
 environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social
 applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.
 Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,
 but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can
 also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional
 copyright holder, this sounds ideal.
Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that
 can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and “All
 Rights Reserved” are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much
 to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the
 more people remix your works, the higher the return.
I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for
 those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people’s
 sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their
 property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also
 lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all
 property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like
 to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity
Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It’s not a very hard
 concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free
 Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.
 These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for
 both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new
 licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it’s becoming
 easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems.
The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain
Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a
 naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the
 power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world
 into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and
 software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social
 Software.
This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for
 human society. With new “hairy” emergent technologies sprouting all
 around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the
 throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we
 social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all
 people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will
 be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now
 we can put it all online.
Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not
 be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This
 may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing
 policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I’m discussing can
 improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging
 democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,
 social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share
 data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence
 of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our
 rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be
 made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.
 This “Emergent Democracy” is more real-time than periodical
 parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our
 choices, beyond the binary options of “Yes” or “No” referenda.
 Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because
 we will represent ourselves within the system.
Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing
 environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the
 public’s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant
 support from her peers and her peers’ peers. Appeals to justice will
 take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.
 Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With
 multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become
 more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act
 alone.
Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of
 the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and
 mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational
 system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community
 of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to
 social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society
 down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle
 is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and
 machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,
 anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more
 flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create
 a new social order−A Mind Revolution!

 The horses and packs were loaded before we went aboard the scoutship.
 The scout bay is no more than a great oversized airlock with a dozen
 small ships squatting over their tubes, but it was the last of the Ship
 that I might ever see, so I took a long final look from the top of the
 ramp.


 There were sixteen of us girls and thirteen boys. We took our places
 in the seats in the center of the scout. Riggy Allen made a joke that
 nobody bothered to laugh at, and then we were all silent. I was feeling
 lost and just beginning to enjoy it when Jimmy Dentremont came over to
 me. He's red-headed and has a face that makes him look about ten. An
 intelligent runt like me.


 He said what I expected. ""Mia, do you want to go partners if we can get
 together when we get down?""


 I guess he thought that because we were always matched on study I liked
 him. Well, I did when I wasn't mad at him, but now I had that crack
 he'd made about being a snob in mind, so I said, ""Not likely. I want to
 come back alive."" It wasn't fair, but it was a good crack and he went
 back to his place without saying anything.


 My name is Mia Havero. I'm fourteen, of course, or I wouldn't be
 telling this. I'm short, dark and scrawny, though I don't expect that
 scrawniness to last much longer. Mother is very good looking. In the
 meantime, I've got brains as a consolation.


 After we were all settled, George Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps.
 We sat there for five minutes while they bled air out of our tube and
 then we just ... dropped. My stomach turned flips. We didn't have to
 leave that way, but George thinks it's fun to be a hot pilot.


 Thinking it over, I was almost sorry I'd been stinking to Jimmy D. He's
 the only competition I have my own age. The trouble is, you don't go
 partners with the competition, do you? Besides, there was still that
 crack about being a snob.


 The planet chosen for our Trial was called Tintera. The last contact
 the Ship had had with it—and we were the ones who dropped them—was
 almost 150 years ago. No contact since. That had made the Council
 debate a little before they dropped us there, but they decided it was
 all right in the end. It didn't make any practical difference to us
 kids because they never tell you anything about the place they're going
 to drop you. All I knew was the name. I wouldn't have known that much
 if Daddy weren't Chairman of the Council.


 I felt like crawling in a corner of the ship and crying, but nobody
 else was breaking down, so I didn't. I did feel miserable. I cried when
 I said good-by to Mother and Daddy—a real emotional scene—but that
 wasn't in public.
It wasn't the chance of not coming back that bothered me really,
 because I never believed that I wouldn't. The thought that made me
 unhappy was that I would have to be on a planet for a whole month.
 Planets make me feel wretched.


 The gravity is always wrong, for one thing. Either your arches and
 calves ache or every time you step you think you're going to trip on
 a piece of fluff and break your neck. There are vegetables everywhere
 and little grubby things just looking for
you
to crawl on. If you
 can think of anything creepier than that, you've got a real nasty
 imagination. Worst of all, planets stink. Every single one smells—I've
 been on enough to know that. A planet is all right for a Mud-eater, but
 not for me.


 We have a place in the Ship like that—the Third Level—but it's only a
 thousand square miles and any time it gets on your nerves you can go up
 a level or down a level and be back in civilization.


 When we reached Tintera, they started dropping us. We swung over the
 sea from the morning side and then dropped low over gray-green forested
 hills. Finally George spotted a clear area and dropped into it. They
 don't care what order you go in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed his
 gear and then led his horse down the ramp. I think he was still
 smarting from the slap I'd given him.


 In a minute we were airborne again. I wondered if I would ever see
 Jimmy—if he would get back alive.


 It's no game we play. When we turn fourteen, they drop us on the
 nearest colonized planet and come back one month later. That may sound
 like fun to you, but a lot of us never come back alive.


 Don't think I was helpless. I'm hell on wheels. They don't let us grow
 for fourteen years and then kick us out to die. They prepare us. They
 do figure, though, that if you can't keep yourself alive by the time
 you're fourteen, you're too stupid, foolish or unlucky to be any use to
 the Ship. There's sense behind it. It means that everybody on the Ship
 is a person who can take care of himself if he has to. Daddy says that
 something has to be done in a closed society to keep the population
 from decaying mentally and physically, and this is it. And it helps to
 keep the population steady.


 I began to check my gear out—sonic pistol, pickup signal so I could be
 found at the end of the month, saddle and cinches, food and clothes.
 Venie Morlock has got a crush on Jimmy D., and when she saw me start
 getting ready to go, she began to check her gear, too. At our next
 landing, I grabbed Ninc's reins and cut Venie out smoothly. It didn't
 have anything to do with Jimmy. I just couldn't stand to put off the
 bad moment any longer.


 The ship lifted impersonally away from Ninc and me like a rising bird,
 and in just a moment it was gone. Its gray-blue color was almost the
 color of the half-overcast sky, so I was never sure when I saw it last.
II


 The first night was hell, I guess because I'm not used to having the
 lights out. That's when you really start to feel lonely, being alone in
 the dark. When the sun disappears, somehow you wonder in your stomach
 if it's really going to come back. But I lived through it—one day in
 thirty gone.


 I rode in a spiral search pattern during the next two days. I had three
 things in mind—stay alive, find people and find some of the others.
 The first was automatic. The second was to find out if there was a slot
 I could fit into for a month. If not, I would have to find a place to
 camp out, as nasty as that would be. The third was to join forces,
 though not with that meatball Jimmy D.


 No, he isn't really a meatball. The trouble is that I don't take
 nothing from nobody, especially him, and he doesn't take nothing from
 nobody, especially me. So we do a lot of fighting.


 I had a good month for Trial. My birthday is in November—too close to
 Year End Holiday for my taste, but this year it was all right. It was
 spring on Tintera, but it was December in the Ship, and after we got
 back we had five days of Holiday to celebrate. It gave me something to
 look forward to.


 In two days of riding, I ran onto nothing but a few odd-looking
 animals. I shot one small one and ate it. It turned out to taste pretty
 good, though not as good as a slice from Hambone No. 4, to my mind the
 best meat vat on the Ship. I've eaten things so gruey-looking that I
 wondered that anybody had the guts to try them in the first place and
 they've turned out to taste good. And I've seen things that looked good
 that I couldn't keep on my stomach. So I guess I was lucky.


 On the third day, I found the road. I brought Ninc down off the
 hillside, losing sight of the road in the trees, and then reaching
 it in the level below. It was narrow and made of sand spread over a
 hard base. Out of the marks in the sand, I could pick out the tracks
 of horses and both narrow and wide wheels. Other tracks I couldn't
 identify.


 One of the smartest moves in history was to include horses when
 they dropped the colonies. I say ""they"" because, while we did the
 actual dropping, the idea originated with the whole evac plan back on
 Earth. Considering how short a time it was in which the colonies were
 established, there was not time to set up industry, so they had to have
 draft animals.


 The first of the Great Ships was finished in 2025. One of the eight,
 as well as the two that were being built then, went up with everything
 else in the Solar System in 2041. In that sixteen years 112 colonies
 were planted. I don't know how many of those planets had animals that
could
have been substituted but, even if they had, they would have
 had to be domesticated from scratch. That would have been stupid. I'll
 bet that half the colonies would have failed if they hadn't had horses.
We'd come in from the west over the ocean, so I traveled east on the
 road. That much water makes me nervous, and roads have to go somewhere.


 I came on my first travelers three hours later. I rounded a tree-lined
 bend, ducking an overhanging branch, and pulled Ninc to a stop. There
 were five men on horseback herding a bunch of the ugliest creatures
 alive.


 They were green and grotesque. They had squat bodies, long limbs and
 knobby bulges at their joints. They had square, flat animal masks for
 faces. But they walked on their hind legs and they had paws that were
 almost hands, and that was enough to make them seem almost human. They
 made a wordless, chilling, lowing sound as they milled and plodded
 along.


 I started Ninc up again and moved slowly to catch up with them. All the
 men on horseback had guns in saddle boots. They looked as nervous as
 cats with kittens. One of them had a string of packhorses on a line
 and he saw me and called to another who seemed to be the leader. That
 one wheeled his black horse and rode back toward me.


 He was a middle-aged man, maybe as old as my Daddy. He was large and he
 had a hard face. Normal enough, but hard. He pulled to a halt when we
 reached each other, but I kept going. He had to come around and follow
 me. I believe in judging a person by his face. A man can't help the
 face he owns, but he can help the expression he wears on it. If a man
 looks mean, I generally believe that he is. This one looked mean. That
 was why I kept riding.


 He said, ""What be you doing out here, boy? Be you out of your head?
 There be escaped Losels in these woods.""


 I told you I hadn't finished filling out yet, but I hadn't thought it
 was that bad. I wasn't ready to make a fight over the point, though.
 Generally, I can't keep my bloody mouth shut, but now I didn't say
 anything. It seemed smart.


 ""Where be you from?"" he asked.


 I pointed to the road behind us.


 ""And where be you going?""


 I pointed ahead. No other way to go.


 He seemed exasperated. I have that effect sometimes. Even on Mother and
 Daddy, who should know better.


 We were coming up on the others now, and the man said, ""Maybe you'd
 better ride on from here with us. For protection.""


 He had an odd way of twisting his sounds, almost as though he had a
 mouthful of mush. I wondered whether he were just an oddball or whether
 everybody here spoke the same way. I'd never heard International
 English spoken any way but one, even on the planet Daddy made me visit
 with him.


 One of the other outriders came easing by then. I suppose they'd been
 watching us all the while. He called to the hard man.


 ""He be awfully small, Horst. I doubt me a Losel'd even notice him at
 all. We mought as well throw him back again.""


 The rider looked at me. When I didn't dissolve in terror as he
 expected, he shrugged and one of the other men laughed.


 The hard man said to the others, ""This boy will be riding along with us
 to Forton for protection.""


 I looked down at the plodding, unhappy creatures they were driving
 along and one looked back at me with dull, expressionless golden eyes.
 I felt uncomfortable.


 I said, ""I don't think so.""


 What the man did then surprised me. He said, ""I do think so,"" and
 reached for the rifle in his saddle boot.


 I whipped my sonic pistol out so fast that he was caught leaning over
 with the rifle half out. His jaw dropped. He knew what I held and he
 didn't want to be fried.


 I said, ""Ease your rifles out and drop them gently to the ground.""


 They did, watching me all the while with wary expressions.


 When all the rifles were on the ground, I said, ""All right, let's go.""


 They didn't want to move. They didn't want to leave the rifles. I
 could see that. Horst didn't say anything. He just watched me with
 narrowed eyes. But one of the others held up a hand and in wheedling
 tones said, ""Look here, kid....""


 ""Shut up,"" I said, in as mean a voice as I could muster, and he did. It
 surprised me. I didn't think I sounded
that
mean. I decided he just
 didn't trust the crazy kid not to shoot.


 After twenty minutes of easy riding for us and hard walking for the
 creatures, I said, ""If you want your rifles, you can go back and get
 them now."" I dug my heels into Ninc's sides and rode on. At the next
 bend I looked back and saw four of them holding their packhorses and
 the creatures still while one beat a dust-raising retreat down the road.


 I put this episode in the ""file and hold for analysis"" section in my
 mind and rode on, feeling good. I think I even giggled once. Sometimes
 I even convince myself that I'm hell on wheels.
III


 When I was nine, my Daddy gave me a painted wooden doll that my
 great-grandmother brought from Earth. The thing is that inside it,
 nestled one in another, are eleven more dolls, each one smaller than
 the last. I like to watch people when they open it for the first time.


 My face must have been like that as I rode along the road.


 The country leveled into a great rolling valley and the trees gave
 way to great farms and fields. In the fields, working, were some of
 the green creatures, which surprised me since the ones I'd seen before
 hadn't seemed smart enough to count to one, let alone do any work.


 But it relieved me. I thought they might have been eating them or
 something.


 I passed two crossroads and started to meet more people, but nobody
 questioned me. I met people on horseback, and twice I met trucks moving
 silently past. And I overtook a wagon driven by the oldest man I've
 seen in my life. He waved to me, and I waved back.


 Near the end of the afternoon I came to the town, and there I received
 a jolt that sickened me.


 By the time I came out on the other side, I was sick. My hands were
 cold and sweaty and my head was spinning, and I wanted to kick Ninc to
 a gallop.


 I rode slowly in, looking all around, missing nothing. The town was all
 stone, wood and brick. Out of date. Out of time, really. There were
 no machines more complicated than the trucks I'd seen earlier. At the
 edge of town, I passed a newspaper office with a headline pasted in the
 window—INVASION! I remember that. I wondered about it.


 But I looked most closely at the people. In all that town, I didn't
 see one girl over ten years old and no grown-up women at all. There
 were little kids, there were boys and there were men, but no girls. All
 the boys and men wore pants, and so did I, which must have been why
 Horst and his buddies assumed I was a boy. It wasn't flattering; but
 I decided I'd not tell anybody different until I found what made the
 clocks tick on this planet.


 But that wasn't what bothered me. It was the kids. My God! They
 swarmed. I saw a family come out of a house—a father and
four
children. It was the most foul thing I've ever seen. It struck me
 then—these people were Free Birthers! I felt a wave of nausea and I
 closed my eyes until it passed.
The first thing you learn in school is that if it weren't for idiot and
 criminal people like these, Earth would never have been destroyed. The
 evacuation would never have had to take place, and eight billion people
 wouldn't have died. There wouldn't have
been
eight billion people.
 But, no. They bred and they spread and they devoured everything in
 their path like a cancer. They gobbled up all the resources that Earth
 had and crowded and shoved one another until the final war came.


 I am lucky. My great-great-grandparents were among those who had enough
 foresight to see what was coming. If it hadn't been for them and some
 others like them, there wouldn't be any humans left anywhere. And I
 wouldn't be here. That may not scare you, but it scares me.


 What happened before, when people didn't use their heads and wound up
 blowing the Solar System apart, is something nobody should forget. The
 older people don't let us forget. But these people had, and that the
 Council should know.


 For the first time since I landed on Tintera, I felt
really
frightened. There was too much going on that I didn't understand. I
 felt a blind urge to get away, and when I reached the edge of town, I
 whomped Ninc a good one and gave him his head.


 I let him run for almost a mile before I pulled him down to a walk
 again. I couldn't help wishing for Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he's
 smart and brains I needed.


 How do you find out what's going on? Eavesdrop? That's a lousy method.
 For one thing, people can't be depended on to talk about the things you
 want to hear. For another, you're likely to get caught. Ask somebody?
 Who? Make the mistake of bracing a fellow like Horst and you might wind
 up with a sore head and an empty pocket. The best thing I could think
 of was to find a library, but that might be a job.


 I'd had two bad shocks on this day, but they weren't the last. In the
 late afternoon, when the sun was starting to sink and a cool wind was
 starting to ripple the tree leaves, I saw the scoutship high in the
 sky. The dying sun colored it a deep red. Back again? I wondered what
 had gone wrong.


 I reached down into my saddlebag and brought out my contact signal.
 The scoutship swung up in the sky in a familiar movement calculated to
 drop the stomach out of everybody aboard. George Fuhonin's style. I
 triggered the signal, my heart turning flips all the while. I didn't
 know why he was back, but I wasn't really sorry.


 The ship swung around until it was coming back on a path almost over my
 head, going in the same direction. Then it went into a slip and started
 bucking so hard that I knew this wasn't hot piloting at all, just plain
 idiot stutter-fingered stupidity at the controls. As it skidded by me
 overhead, I got a good look at it and knew that it wasn't one of ours.
 Not too different, but not ours.
One more enigma. Where was it from? Not here. Even if you know how, and
 we wouldn't tell these Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is something that
 takes an advanced technology to build.
I felt defeated and tired. Not much farther along the road, I came to
 a campsite with two wagons pulled in for the night, and I couldn't
 help but pull in myself. The campsite was large and had two permanent
 buildings on it. One was a well enclosure and the other was little more
 than a high-walled pen. It didn't even have a roof.


 I set up camp and ate my dinner. In the wagon closest to me were a man,
 his wife and their three children. The kids were running around and
 playing, and one of them ran close to the high-walled pen. His father
 came and pulled him away.


 The kids weren't to blame for their parents, but when one of them said
 hello to me, I didn't even answer. I know how lousy I would feel if I
 had two or three brothers and sisters, but it didn't strike me until
 that moment that it wouldn't even seem out of the ordinary to these
 kids. Isn't that horrible?


 About the time I finished eating, and before it grew dark, the old man
 I had seen earlier in the day drove his wagon in. He fascinated me. He
 had white hair, something I had read about in stories but had never
 seen before.


 When nightfall came, they started a large fire. Everybody gathered
 around. There was singing for awhile, and then the father of the
 children tried to pack them off to bed. But they weren't ready to go,
 so the old man started telling them a story. In the old man's odd
 accent, and sitting there in the campfire light surrounded by darkness,
 it seemed just right.


 It was about an old witch named Baba Yaga who lived in the forest in
 a house that stood on chicken legs. She was the nasty stepmother of a
 nice little girl, and to get rid of the kid, she sent her on a phony
 errand into the deep dark woods at nightfall. I could appreciate the
 poor girl's position. All the little girl had to help her were the
 handkerchief, the comb and the pearl that she had inherited from her
 dear dead mother. But, as it turned out, they were just enough to
 defeat nasty old Baba Yaga and bring the girl safely home.


 I wished for the same for myself.


 The old man had just finished and they were starting to drag the kids
 off to bed when there was a commotion on the road at the edge of the
 camp. I looked but my eyes were adjusted to the light of the fire and I
 couldn't see far into the dark.


 A voice there said, ""I'll be damned if I'll take another day like this
 one, Horst. We should have been here hours ago. It be your fault we're
 not.""


 Horst growled a retort. I decided that it was time for me to leave the
 campfire. I got up and eased away as Horst and his men came up to the
 fire, and cut back to where Ninc was parked. I grabbed up my blankets
 and mattress and started to roll them up. I had a pretty good idea now
 what they used the high-walled pen for.


 I should have known that they would have to pen the animals up for the
 night. I should have used my head. I hadn't and now it was time to take
 leave.


 I never got the chance.
I was just heaving the saddle up on Ninc when I felt a hand on my
 shoulder and I was swung around.


 ""Well, well. Horst, look who we have here,"" he called. It was the one
 who'd made the joke about me being beneath the notice of a Losel. He
 was alone with me now, but with that call the others would be up fast.


 I brought the saddle around as hard as I could and then up, and he
 went down. He started to get up again, so I dropped the saddle on him
 and reached inside my jacket for my gun. Somebody grabbed me then from
 behind and pinned my arms to my side.


 I opened my mouth to scream—I have a good scream—but a rough smelly
 hand clamped down over it before I had a chance to get more than a
 lungful of air. I bit down hard—5000 lbs. psi, I'm told—but he
 didn't let me go. I started to kick, but Horst jerked me off my feet
 and dragged me off.


 When we were behind the pen and out of earshot of the fire, he stopped
 dragging me and dropped me in a heap. ""Make any noise,"" he said, ""and
 I'll hurt you.""


 That was a silly way to put it, but somehow it said more than if he'd
 threatened to break my arm or my head. It left him a latitude of things
 to do if he pleased. He examined his hand. There was enough moonlight
 for that. ""I ought to club you anyway,"" he said.


 The one I'd dropped the saddle on came up then. The others were putting
 the animals in the pen. He started to kick me, but Horst stopped him.


 ""No,"" he said. ""Look through the kid's gear, bring the horse and what
 we can use.""


 The other one didn't move. ""Get going, Jack,"" Horst said in a menacing
 tone and they stood toe to toe for a long moment before Jack finally
 backed down. It seemed to me that Horst wasn't so much objecting to me
 being kicked, but was rather establishing who did the kicking in his
 bunch.


 But I wasn't done yet. I was scared, but I still had the pistol under
 my jacket.


 Horst turned back to me and I said, ""You can't do this and get away
 with it.""


 He said, ""Look, boy. You may not know it, but you be in a lot of
 trouble. So don't give me a hard time.""


 He still thought I was a boy. It was not time to correct him, but I
 didn't like to see the point go unchallenged. It was unflattering.


 ""The courts won't let you get away with this,"" I said. I'd passed
 a courthouse in the town with a carved motto over the doors: EQUAL
 JUSTICE UNDER THE LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or
 something stuffy like that.


 He laughed, not a phony, villian-type laugh, but a real laugh, so I
 knew I'd goofed.


 ""Boy, boy. Don't talk about the courts. I be doing you a favor. I be
 taking what I can use of your gear, but I be letting you go. You go to
 court and they'll take everything and lock you up besides. I be leaving
 you your freedom.""


 ""Why would they be doing that?"" I asked. I slipped my hand under my
 jacket.


 ""Every time you open your mouth you shout that you be off one of the
 Ships,"" Horst said. ""That be enough. They already have one of you brats
 in jail in Forton.""


 I was about to bring my gun out when up came Jack leading Ninc, with
 all my stuff loaded on. I mentally thanked him.


 He said, ""The kid's got some good equipment. But I can't make out what
 this be for."" He held out my pickup signal.


 Horst looked at it, then handed it back. ""Throw it away,"" he said.


 I leveled my gun at them—Hell on Wheels strikes again! I said, ""Hand
 that over to me.""


 Horst made a disgusted sound.


 ""Don't make any noise,"" I said, ""or you'll fry. Now hand it over.""


 I stowed it away, then paused with one hand on the leather horn of the
 saddle. ""What's the name of the kid in jail in Forton.""


 ""I can't remember,"" he said. ""But it be coming to me. Hold on.""


 I waited. Then suddenly my arm was hit a numbing blow from behind
 and the gun went flying. Jack pounced after it and Horst said, ""Good
 enough,"" to the others who'd come up behind me.


 I felt like a fool.


 Horst stalked over and got the signal. He dropped it on the ground and
 said in a voice far colder than mine could ever be, because it was
 natural and mine wasn't, ""The piece be yours."" Then he tromped on it
 until it cracked and fell apart.


 Then he said, ""Pull a gun on me twice. Twice."" He slapped me so hard
 that my ears rang. ""You dirty little punk.""


 I said calmly, ""You big louse.""


 It was a time I would have done better to keep my mouth shut. All I can
 remember is a flash of pain as his fist crunched against the side of my
 face and then nothing.

I was wandering among the tall grass of the slopes, listening to the
 soft whistling of the wind; allowing the grass to caress my toga and
 thighs. It was a day soft and clear; a day accepted by the young,
 cherished by we old. Across the gently undulating hills stood the
 magnificent Melopolis, encradling the Oracle of Delni. I do not, of
 course, believe in the gods per se; still there is a grandeur in the
 very stones that transcends their human sculptors, and it is no wonder
 to me that many cling tenaciously, and ignorantly, to the old religion.
 Cling to the gods of old, who drew man upward from wherever he began.
 In whose names Man killed and plundered, while struggling up. In whose
 names Man finally left this earth, to seek his cousins among the stars.


 But of course there were no cousins. There was nothing. And Man
 returned, and settled down to live. Saddened, but resigned and content
 to live in peace with his knowledge and his power. Gone now are all the
 ancient evils, wars, emergencies.


 ""Sias! Sias—"" And they were upon me.


 That is, Xeon was upon me. But I knew that where Xeon is, Melia must
 soon appear. And indeed it was but a moment before Melia slipped
 through the high grass to stand at his side. Their youthful voices were
 babbling in excitement.


 Melia was a She, with the swelling breasts that were, so tradition
 states, quite prevalent among members of the race long ago, and are
 seldom seen today. Indeed, Melia was on this account made the butt of
 many jokes and, I fear, would have had a lonely life of it had it not
 been for the friendship of Xeon.


 ""Sias,"" they were saying, ""the Maternite's gone.""


 I stared in amazement.


 ""Gone? It cannot be gone. It has always been—""


 ""Oh my gods!"" Xeon shouted. ""I tell you it's gone! Will you—""


 Melia interrupted him quietly. ""Xeon, will you lose all respect for
 the Elder?"" Then turned to me, and said calmly, ""The watcher at the
 Maternite Machine, it appears, has been drunk. The heat rose above the
 warning, continued to rise, and then—poof. Everything has evaporated
 in Maternite. All the Prelife is gone.""


 ""All of it?"" I asked.


 ""There is nothing left,"" Melia insisted. ""Can more be made? And if not,
 what will happen with no more children?""


 ""That is for the priests to say, not I,"" I replied. In moments of
 emergency, it is wise to speak with caution. That is, I suppose so. I
 have never before been in a real emergency.
A man my age does not hurry in the heat of the midday sun—maddugs
 nenglishmin go out in the midday sun, as the ancients say, although I
 often wonder why—but Xeon and Melia ran all the way down to the city.
 They are of an age to enter manhood, and have all the energy such young
 men do.


 As we entered the city, we were surrounded by confusion and
 consternation. And can the simple people be blamed? They were aware
 that they stood in the midst of an unprecedented happening; indeed, an
 emergency. For a machine had failed!


 Not in the memory of the eldest among us has a machine failed. They
 were created so long ago, indeed, that the ignorant believe them
 to have been constructed by the gods themselves. And never, so far
 as I know, has one failed. Small wonder that the watcher had been
 negligent. Indeed, the watcher is more a tradition than a necessity.
 Besides, had he been sober, he would not have known what to do. For who
 knows the mysterious workings of the machines?
I hastened to the City Hall and found the Conclave assembled, waiting
 for me to bring them to order. Xeon and Melia stopped as I mounted the
 steps, but I smiled and motioned them in. They accompanied me past
 the marble pillars into the cool recesses of the Hall, then seated
 themselves on the floor as I took my place by the great table.


 Well, you know how these things are. At such a time, many men feel
 impelled to make speeches, and one must not be disrespectful. Prayers
 and supplications were offered to the gods, priests were sent to
 sacrifice, and finally, as the light of the sun was falling between the
 pillars, the High Priest of the Maternite Machine was heard.


 He rambled through the customary opening remarks and then, continually
 smoothing his white beard—of which he is excessively proud—approached
 the crux of the matter and the Conclave finally heard the facts it had
 assembled to hear. By this time, unfortunately, many of the Conclave
 had departed for home and supper. Yet perhaps it is for the best, for
 those left were the most earnest and intelligent.


 ""I would not bore you,"" he said, ""with details of which only the gods
 are sure. Know, then, that once granted a few cells of Prelife, it is
 an easy matter for the Maternite Machine to add more and more; thus
 assuring us, as has always been, a continuous source of Prelife to be
 born by the Generating Machine as children. The machines bear the exact
 number of children each year to balance the number of us whom the gods
 claim. Such it has always been from time immemorial.""


 A murmur of assent and approval of these virtuous words whispered
 around the Hall.


 ""But now,"" he continued, however, with less assurance and indeed with
 even a stutter here and there, ""an unprecedented situation has arisen.
 Indeed, I might call it an emergency. For the M-Maternite Machine has
 actually failed.""


 Cries of ""Treason"" sprang up, and I fear it might have gone hard for
 the priest had I not been able to insure order.


 ""That is not the worst,"" he cried, as if in defiance. ""All the Prelife
 has been dried up. It will not function. There is no more. And there
 will be no more children!""


 At this I feared the Conclave was about to riot. It is at such times
 that I most revere the wisdom of the ancients, who decreed seventy
 years the minimum age for a member of the Conclave. They shouted and
 began to beat their fists, but for how long can a man of seventy years
 roar like a youngster? They quieted, breathing heavily, and I asked,


 ""Is there no way, then, to produce more Prelife in order that the
 machines may produce more children for us?


 ""As I have said,"" he replied, ""give the machines but a bit of Prelife
 and they will produce more. But take away that least bit, and they are
 helpless.""


 Such heresy could have brought a sad end to the priest had not the
 Conclave been so exhausted by the events of the day. We leaned back to
 think.


 Rocsates leaned forward and asked, ""Must there not—must there not have
 been a beginning to Prelife? For the Machine, it seems, cannot make it;
 and yet it came from somewhere.""


 ""Riddles are not called for,"" I answered severely.


 ""Are not riddles often the beginning of knowledge?"" he asked, in that
 irritating dumber-than-thou attitude of his. ""Must there not, long ago,
 have been a source of Prelife: a source now forgotten? And may it not
 even now—should we discover it—be available to us? I am reminded of
 the story of the animals of old—""


 ""I fear your mind is wandering, Rocsates,"" I was forced to interrupt.
 ""I know well the legend of the animals, but what does it have to
 do—"" The heads of the Conclave were turning to me, quizzically. I
 hastened to explain the legend of the animals. ""It is said that many
 thousands of years ago, time without reckoning, there existed on the
 earth creatures who were alive like us, and yet not like us. It is said
 they had four legs or more, and no arms, were covered with hair, and
 although not mute, they could not speak.""


 Rocsates' voice made itself heard. ""It is true. Such creatures did
 indeed exist. It is recorded most scientifically in the films.""


 ""If it be so,"" I said, quieting the hub-bub that followed, ""and I would
 not doubt your word, Rocsates, for all know you are the wisest of
 men—if it were so, then, what of it?""


 ""May it not be,"" Rocsates put in, ""that these animals had no machines
 to reproduce their kind? For surely the gods would not grant machines
 to such creatures. And indeed, if they had Maternite Machines, why then
 we would yet have these animals among us.""


 ""And how, then, did these animals reproduce?"" I asked.


 ""How, indeed? And is there not a legend—admitted only a legend—that
 says there was a time before the machines, and before the Maternite
 Machine, and that at such a time both the animals and Men reproduced
 from within their own bodies?""


 At this two members of the Conclave fell immediately into a faint, and
 I would gladly have joined them. I hoped that the youngsters, Xeon
 and Melia, had not heard, but as I turned they were listening most
 attentively to Rocsates, who, amid cries of ""Heresy"" and ""Treason"",
 went on:


 ""I should like to ask the Conclave for permission to search the ancient
 records, in the hope of finding some such knowledge that would prove or
 disprove my words.""


 ""You wish to search the films—"" I began.


 ""Not the films, Sias, but the books.""


 Gods, this Rocsates! The books, as well he knows, are so ancient,
 and so delicate, that they are kept in an air-tight tomb; lest,
 being handled, they be destroyed and all knowledge within them lost.
 Therefore, they have not been read in the known history of our race.
 And Rocsates has been anxious for an excuse—


 ""Sias,"" he went on, ""if there exists such knowledge as I seek, is it
 not indeed lost to the memory of Man? And if so, are not the books the
 only place where it may be found?""


 Rocsates, it is suspected, will never ask a question unless he knows
 the answer beforehand. And so I acquiesced, and agreed, and granted
 permission. And with much misgiving and foreboding of evil, the
 Conclave adjourned.
Several weeks elapsed before Rocsates requested that the Conclave meet.
 I called the meeting at dawn and so it was yet early in the afternoon
 when formalities were concluded and Rocsates granted leave to speak.


 ""Some of those among you are She's,"" he began. ""And you know you are
 different from the rest of us. To the advantage, your skin is fairer
 and your features more often handsomer than ours. To the disadvantage,
 your excretory system is not so mechanically dextrous as ours. And, you
 may say, why should this not be so? There is, indeed, no reason why we
 should all be identical. Perforce you have the advantage, perforce we
 do. Yet there is one other distinction.


 ""Some among you She's have the swelling of the breasts. And does there
 exist no reason for this? Was there not, perhaps in ancient times, a
 cause for this? Do you not wonder, She's, whence you come and for what
 reason?""


 ""Rocsates,"" I interrupted. ""All this is fascinating, of course. But if
 you could be quick—""


 ""Of course,"" he replied. ""In the course of my reading I have read
 many books, and while they are all vague on the subject, this I have
 discovered:


 ""That there was indeed a time before the machines, in fact the books
 were created in that time, for not one of them mentions the machines.
 Then reproduction was carried on by individuals, without help of the
 then nonexistent machines. The She's are not wanderers from another
 land, but they have lived with us for all time; they are not another
 race, but we are all types of one race. And the fact of reproduction is
 somehow intimately related to the physical distinctions of the She's!""


 These last sentences were shouted to be heard above the roar of the
 crowd. Yet when Rocsates stopped, so also did the noise, so shocked and
 amazed at his words were they. And I confess, myself also.


 ""In fact,"" Rocsates added, sitting down, ""this process of reproduction
 seems to have been so simple that there was once a problem of
 over-population.""


 Order was lost among the Conclave as each man turned to speak to his
 neighbor, and for some time I could not restore order. I realized that
 something had to be done to save Rocsates before the outrage of the
 assembled overwhelmed him.


 ""It seems,"" I shouted, ""that there is a flaw in your logic."" For if
 such there was, I was hopeful of dismissing the entire affair with
 no harm done. ""For if people reproduced too often, why then this
 reproduction must have been a pleasant thing to do; otherwise they
 would not have done so to excess. And if it was a pleasant thing to do,
 where is the necessity for the machines, and why were they created?""


 Rocsates seemed perplexed by this problem, whereupon Xeon, who together
 with Melia were at the Conclave without permission, shouted, ""Perhaps
 the process of reproduction was of
such
a pleasure that the Conclave
 ruled it to be a sin? And therefore the machines were necessary!""


 At this impudence the Conclave dissolved in an uproar, and I was beyond
 power to restrain them from placing Xeon under arrest. Privately,
 however, I had to admit that his supposition was a possibility, and
 thus I authorized Rocsates to continue his search.
Now indeed I was sorely worried concerning Xeon, for he must languish
 in the dungeon until the Conclave is satisfied to release him, and this
 they cannot do until they meet again.


 I needed a sufficient excuse to call a meeting of the Conclave,
 whereupon I might argue for the lad. When I heard that Rocsates again
 desired audience, I immediately proclaimed a meeting of the Conclave
 to be held the next day at dawn, and so that night slept well.


 The Conclave had come to order and formalities had been initiated when
 Rocsates entered and took his place. He clutched under one shoulder
 a thin, rectangular object, but that is not what impressed me. His
 appearance—he looked as if he had not slept of late, nor eaten either.
 His eyes were sunken, and his features had doubled in age. He was bent
 and tired. But it was his eyes. There was a horror in them.


 I was shocked, and could not help staring at him. And then the
 formalities were over. I intended to speak for Xeon, but Rocsates was
 on his feet and I gave way.


 ""I have indeed discovered the secret of reproduction,"" he began. ""After
 many searchings, I came upon this—"" and he held forth the object he
 had carried in. ""It is a book. It is entitled, 'Living a Normal Sex
 Life.' It seems to be some sort of a do-it-yourself pamphlet."" He
 dropped the book on the table and rubbed his hands over his eyes.


 There was something in the man's behavior that commanded everyone's
 attention. He went on, speaking low. ""The word 'Sex' is not defined,
 but it seems to mean...."" His words trailed off. He was obviously
 unsure of how to continue. ""I had better start at the beginning, I
 suppose,"" he said. ""You see, once upon a time there were birds and
 bees....""
When he finished the Conclave sat in horrified silence. His words,
 with all their horror, had the ring of truth and there were no cries of
 'Heresy'. There was only stunned disbelief and the beginnings of nausea.


 It is the mark of honor that a leader shall carry on when others fear
 to move. I cleared my throat.


 ""Shall not these organs which you mention have atrophied by now? With
 no use throughout all these generations, will they not have evolved
 into nothingness?""


 ""I do not think so,"" Rocsates replied after a while. ""What to us is
 an eon, to evolution is but an instant. And then the swelling of the
 breasts, I believe, proves that there is still reproductive activity in
 some, at least, of the She's.""


 We sat shaking our heads, bowed under terrible reality.


 ""Then we must experiment,"" I said. ""But whom could we ask to submit to
 such horror?""


 ""I have already taken the liberty of asking for volunteers,"" Rocsates
 replied. ""The She, of course, must be one with the swelling of the
 breasts. Melia has volunteered, on condition that Xeon be released from
 dungeon. Are there any objections?""
There were none, of course. Who would refuse a boon to one who would
 undergo such an ordeal for the City?


 ""And who will be the partner?"" I asked.


 ""In all honor, could Xeon allow Melia to surpass him in courage? It
 shall be he,"" Rocsates said. And with his word the two entered the Hall
 and stood, noble and naked.


 Rocsates gestured to the table, and Melia started to climb upon it,
 but Xeon stepped forward.


 ""My lords,"" he said, ""would not better results be obtained were we to
 conduct the experiment in the fields before the Oracle of Delni, that
 the gods may help us?""


 His glance reached into my soul, and I was proud of Xeon. A true
 friend, he thought even now of the comfort of Melia. The marble table
 was indeed hard, and from Rocsates' description it seemed that Melia's
 position would be as uncomfortable as it would be undignified. The soft
 fields might be some slight help.


 I voiced my assent, and the entire Conclave adjourned to the fields.
It was nearly dark when we walked home, Rocsates and I, arm in arm. It
 had been a horrible day. The inhuman indignity, the cries—


 We tarried before my home, leaned on the stone, stared at the first
 stars.


 ""They seemed finally to accomplish all the book described,"" I muttered.


 ""They may indeed have succeeded,"" Rocsates replied. ""There is mentioned
 a time lapse which is necessary. The child does not appear immediately.""


 ""It doesn't matter,"" I said disconsolately. ""Who could ask them to go
 through such an ordeal again?""


 And then I looked down to earth again, and saw them standing before me.
 Melia cast her eyes down, and would not raise them. Xeon held his arm
 about her shoulders, as if to protect her, but I know not from whom.


 ""Sias,"" he said. Then stopped, embarrassed.


 I waited, and Rocsates was silent, and he continued.


 ""Sias, we come to tell.... We will...."" He raised his eyes to mine and
 said manfully, ""We shall try again.""


 I am afraid that tears came to my eyes. Such sacrifice—


 ""We beg one favor,"" Xeon went on. ""We are agreed that—Well, we should
 like to be left alone, in private, to try.""


 ""Of course,"" I replied. Anything they might want they could have. My
 relief and gratitude must have showed, for Xeon took a deep breath and
 spoke again.


 ""We do not deserve praise, Sias,"" he said. ""The truth is, we ... we
 sort of enjoy it.""


 I watched them turn and wander off together under the stars.


 My heart has a warmth in it, and I no longer fear for the future of our
 race when our young people can show such nobility and sacrifice.

CHAPTER I
An Unsolved Mystery
“Tell Judy about it,” begged Lois. “Please, Lorraine,
 it can’t be as bad as it appears. There isn’t
 anything that Judy can’t solve.”
Lorraine tilted her head disdainfully. “We’re sisters
 now. We’re both Farringdon-Petts and should be
 loyal to each other. But you always did take Judy’s
 part. She was the one who nearly spoiled our double
 wedding trying to solve a mystery. I don’t believe
 she’d understand—understand any better than I do.
 Everyone has problems, and I’m sure Judy is no
 exception.”
“You’re right, Lorraine,” announced Judy, coming
 in to serve dessert to the two friends she had invited
 for lunch at Peter’s suggestion. “I do have
 problems, and there are plenty of mysteries I can’t
 solve.”
“Name one,” charged Lois. “Just mention one
 single spooky thing you couldn’t explain, and I’ll
 believe you. I’ve seen you in action, Judy Bolton—”
“Judy Dobbs, remember?”
“Well, you were Judy Bolton when you solved
 all those mysteries. I met you when the whole
 valley below the big Roulsville dam was threatened
 by flood and you solved that—”
“That,” declared Judy, “was my brother Horace,
 not me. He was the hero without even meaning to
 be. He was the one who rode through town and
 warned people that the flood was coming. I was off
 chasing a shadow.”
“A vanishing shadow,” Lois said with a sigh.
 “What you did wasn’t easy, Judy.”
“It didn’t need to be as hard as it was,” Judy confessed.
 “I know now that keeping that promise not
 to talk about the dam was a great big mistake and
 could have cost lives. I should have told Arthur.”
“Please,” Lorraine said, a pained expression clouding
 her pretty face, “let’s not talk about him now.”
“Very well,” Judy agreed. “What shall we talk
 about?”
“You,” Lois said, “and all the mysteries you’ve
 solved. Maybe you were mistaken about a thing or
 two before the flood, but what about the haunted
 house you moved into? You were the one who
 tracked down the ghosts in the attic and the cellar
 and goodness knows where all. You’ve been chasing
 ghosts ever since I met you, and not one of them did
 you fail to explain in some sensible, logical fashion.”
“Before I met you,” Judy said, thinking back,
 “there were plenty of them I couldn’t explain. There
 was one I used to call the spirit of the fountain, but
 what she was or how she spoke to me is more than
 I know. If my grandparents knew, they weren’t telling.
 And now they’re both dead and I can’t ask them.
 They left me a lot of unsolved mysteries along with
 this house. Maybe I’ll find the answers to some of
 them when I finish sorting Grandma’s things. They’re
 stored in one end of the attic.”
“Another haunted attic? How thrilling!” exclaimed
 Lois. “Why don’t you have another ghost party and
 show up the spooks?”
“I didn’t say the attic was haunted.”
Judy was almost sorry she had mentioned it. She
 wasn’t in the mood for digging up old mysteries,
 but Lois and Lorraine insisted. It all began, she finally
 told them, the summer before they met. Horace
 had just started working on the paper. Judy remembered
 that it was Lorraine’s father, Richard Thornton
 Lee, who gave him his job with the
Farringdon
 Daily Herald
. He had turned in some interesting
 church news, convincing Mr. Lee that he had in him
 the makings of a good reporter. And so it was that
 he spent the summer Judy was remembering in Farringdon
 where the Farringdon-Petts had their turreted
 mansion, while she had to suffer the heat and
 loneliness of Dry Brook Hollow.
Her thoughts were what had made it so hard, she
 confessed now as she reviewed everything that had
 happened. She just couldn’t help resenting the fact
 that her parents left her every summer while they
 went off on a vacation by themselves. What did they
 think she would do?
“You’ll have plenty to read,” her father had told
 her. “I bought you six new books in that mystery
 series you like. When they’re finished there are
 plenty of short stories around. Your grandmother
 never throws anything away. She has magazines she’s
 saved since your mother was a girl. If you ask for
 them she’ll let you have the whole stack. I know how
 you love to read.”
“I do, Dad, but if the magazines are that old—”
Judy had stopped. She had seen her father’s tired
 eyes and had realized that a busy doctor needed a
 vacation much more than a schoolgirl who had too
 little to do. He and Judy’s mother usually went to
 the beach hotel where they had honeymooned. It
 was a precious memory. Every summer Dr. Bolton
 and his wife relived it. And every summer Judy
 went to stay with her grandmother Smeed, who
 scolded and fussed and tried to pretend she wasn’t
 glad to have her.
“You here again?” she had greeted her that summer,
 and Judy hadn’t noticed her old eyes twinkling
 behind her glasses. “What do you propose to do with
 yourself this time?”
“Read,” Judy had told her. “Mom and Dad say
 you have a whole stack of old magazines—”
“In the attic. Go up and look them over if you
 can stand the heat.”
Judy went, not to look over the old magazines so
 much as to escape to a place where she could have a
 good cry. It was the summer before her fifteenth
 birthday. In another year she would have outgrown
 her childish resentment of her parents’ vacation or
 be grown up enough to ask them to let her have a
 vacation of her own. In another year she would
 be summering among the beautiful Thousand Islands
 and solving a mystery to be known as the
Ghost
 Parade
.
“A whole parade of ghosts,” Lois would be telling
 her, “and you solved everything.”
But then she didn’t even know Lois. She had no
 idea so many thrilling adventures awaited her. There
 seemed to be nothing—nothing—and so the tears
 came and spilled over on one of the magazines. As
 Judy wiped it away she noticed that it had fallen
 on a picture of a fountain.
“A fountain with tears for water. How strange!”
 she remembered saying aloud.
Judy had never seen a real fountain. The thrill of
 walking up to the door of the palatial Farringdon-Pett
 mansion was still ahead of her. On the lawn a
 fountain still caught and held rainbows like those
 she was to see on her honeymoon at Niagara Falls.
 But all that was in the future. If anyone had told
 the freckled-faced, pigtailed girl that she would one
 day marry Peter Dobbs, she would have laughed in
 their faces.
“That tease!”
For then she knew Peter only as an older boy who
 used to tease her and call her carrot-top until one day
 she yelled back at him, “Carrot-tops are green and so
 are you!”
Peter was to win Judy’s heart when he gave her a
 kitten and suggested the name Blackberry for him.
 The kitten was now a dignified family cat. But the
 summer Judy found the picture of a fountain and
 spilled tears on it she had no kitten. She had nothing,
 she confessed, not even a friend. It had helped to
 pretend the fountain in the picture was filled with
 all the tears lonely girls like herself had ever cried.
“But that would make it enchanted!” she had suddenly
 exclaimed. “If I could find it I’d wish—”
A step had sounded on the stairs. Judy remembered
 it distinctly. She had turned to see her grandmother
 and to hear her say in her usual abrupt fashion,
 “Enchanted fountain, indeed! If you let people
 know your wishes instead of muttering them to
 yourself, most of them aren’t so impossible.”
“Were they?” asked Lois.
She and Lorraine had listened to this much of what
 Judy was telling them without interruption.
“That’s the unsolved mystery,” Judy replied.
 “There weren’t any of them impossible.”
And she went on to tell them how, the very next
 day, her grandparents had taken her to a fountain
 exactly like the one in the picture. It was in the center
 of a deep, circular pool with steps leading up to it.
 Beside the steps were smaller fountains with the
 water spurting from the mouths of stone lions. Judy
 had stared at them a moment and then climbed the
 steps to the pool.
“Am I dreaming?” she remembered saying aloud.
 “Is this beautiful fountain real?”
A voice had answered, although she could see no
 one.
“Make your wishes, Judy. Wish wisely. If you
 shed a tear in the fountain your wishes will surely
 come true.”
“A tear?” Judy had asked. “How can I shed a
 tear when I’m happy? This is a wonderful place.”
“Shed a tear in the fountain and your wishes will
 surely come true,” the voice had repeated.
“But what is there to cry about?”
“You found plenty to cry about back at your
 grandmother’s house,” the mysterious voice had reminded
 her. “Weren’t you crying on my picture up
 there in the attic?”
“Then you—you
are
the fountain!” Judy remembered
 exclaiming. “But a fountain doesn’t speak. It
 doesn’t have a voice.”
“Wish wisely,” the voice from the fountain had
 said in a mysterious whisper.
CHAPTER II
If Wishes Came True
“Did you?” Lois interrupted the story to ask excitedly.
 “Oh, Judy! Don’t keep us in suspense any
 longer. What did you wish?”
“Patience,” Judy said with a smile. “I’m coming
 to that.”
First, she told her friends, she had to think of a
 wise wish. There had been so much she wanted in
 those early days before the flood. Dora Scott had
 been her best friend in Roulsville, but she had moved
 away.
“You see,” she explained, “I made the mistake of
 having just one best friend. There wasn’t anybody
 in Dry Brook Hollow. I remember thinking of how
 lonely I was and how I wished for a friend or a sister,
 and suddenly a tear splashed in the water. It made
 little ripples. I thought I had to wish quickly before
 they vanished, and so I began naming the things I
 wanted as fast as I could. I’m not sure they were
 wise wishes. They seem rather selfish to me, now. I
 wasn’t thinking of anybody but me, Judy Bolton,
 and what I wanted. It wasn’t until after I began to
 think of others that my wishes started to come true.”
“But what were they?” Lois insisted.
Lorraine seemed unusually quiet and thoughtful.
 Judy did not notice the fear in her eyes as she replied
 airily, “Oh, didn’t I tell you? I wished for lots
 of friends and a sister, and I wished I could marry a
 G-man and solve a lot of mysteries and that’s as far
 as I got when the ripples vanished. I thought the
 spell was broken and so I didn’t wish for anything
 more.”
“Wasn’t there anything more you wanted?” Lois
 asked.
“Of course,” replied Judy. “There were lots more
 things. I wanted to go places, of course, and keep
 pets, and have a nice home, and—”
“And your wishes all came true!”
“Every one of them,” Judy agreed, “even the one
 about the sister. You see, it wasn’t a baby sister I
 wanted. It was a sister near my own age. That
 seemed impossible at the time, but the future did
 hold a sister for me.”
“It held one for me, too,” Lois said, squeezing
 Lorraine’s hand under the table. “Don’t you think
 sisters should tell each other their problems, Judy?”
“Honey and I always do,” she replied “but then
 it was different. I didn’t know I would marry Peter
 or that he would become a G-man, and he didn’t
 know he had a sister. It is strange, isn’t it? But the
 strangest thing of all was the fountain itself.”
“Why?” asked Lorraine. “Do you still think it was
 enchanted?”
Lois laughed at this, but Judy was serious as she
 answered, “I was still little girl enough to think so
 at the time. I wandered around, growing very
 drowsy. Then I found a hammock and climbed into
 it. I must have gone to sleep, because I remember
 waking up and wondering if the voice in the fountain
 had been a dream.”
“A hammock?” Lois questioned. “Are you sure it
 wasn’t a flying carpet?”
“No, it was a hammock all right,” Judy assured
 her, laughing. “It was hung between two trees in a
 beautiful garden all enclosed in rose trellises thick
 with roses. Did I tell you it was June?”
“All the year around?”
Again Lois laughed. But Lorraine said abruptly,
 “Let’s not talk about rose gardens in June. It’s a long
 way from June to December.”
“Do you mean a garden changes? I know,” Judy
 said, “but I think this one would be beautiful at any
 time of the year. There were rhododendrons, too,
 and I don’t know how many different kinds of evergreens.
 I explored the garden all around the fountain.”
“And then what happened?” Lorraine urged her.
“Yes, yes. Go on,” entreated Lois. “I didn’t dream
 you’d kept anything that exciting a secret. Why didn’t
 you try to solve the mystery?”
“I think I would have tried,” Judy admitted, “if
 I had been older or more experienced. I really should
 have investigated it more thoroughly and learned the
 secret of the fountain. But after the ripples went
 away it didn’t speak to me any more, and I didn’t
 really think it had heard my wishes. I was still wishing
 for a friend when I met you, Lois. It did seem
 impossible for us to be friends at first, didn’t it? Lorraine
 was your friend.”
“I did make trouble for you,” Lorraine remembered.
 “It was all because of my foolish jealousy.”
“It was nothing compared to the trouble caused by
 the Roulsville flood,” declared Judy. “After that
 things started happening so fast that I completely
 forgot about the fountain. Honestly, Lois, I don’t
 believe I thought about it again until after we moved
 to Farringdon and I walked up to your door and
 saw the fountain on your lawn.”
“The Farringdon-Pett puddle, I always called it,”
 Lois said with a giggle. “I’ve seen lots nicer fountains.”
“You have?” asked Judy. “Then maybe you’ve
 seen the one I’ve been telling you about. I think the
 picture of it is still in the attic. Come on up and I’ll
 show you.”
Lois and Lorraine had finished their dessert while
 Judy was telling them the story of the fountain.
 Somehow, she wasn’t hungry for hers. She had
 tasted it too often while she was making it.
“I’ll leave it for Blackberry,” she decided.
Lois watched in amusement as the cat lapped up
 the chocolate pudding after Judy had mixed it generously
 with cream.
“Sometimes,” Judy said fondly, “Blackberry thinks
 he’s a person. He eats everything we eat, including
 lettuce. Do you mind if he comes with us, Lorraine?
 He wants to explore the attic, too.”
“He’ll remember he’s a cat fast enough if there
 are any mice up there,” Lois said with a giggle.
Leaving the table, they all started upstairs with
 the cat bounding ahead of them. In modernizing her
 grandparents’ house to suit her own and Peter’s
 tastes, Judy had seen to it that the old stair door was
 removed. But there was still a door closing off the
 narrower stairs that led to the attic. Blackberry
 reached it first and yowled for Judy to open it.
“He can read my mind. He always knows where
 I’m going,” Judy said as the door creaked open and
 the cat shot through it. A moment later a weird rolling
 noise came from the floor above.
“Come on. There’s nothing up here to be afraid
 of,” Judy urged her friends.
“Maybe not, but I’m beginning to get the shivers,”
 confessed Lois as she followed Judy to the sewing
 room at the top of the last flight of stairs.
“So am I,” Lorraine admitted. “I’m not superstitious
 about black cats, but they are creepy. Does
 Blackberry have to roll spools across the floor?”
“Now he thinks he’s a kitten,” laughed Judy.
 Pausing at still another door that led to the darker
 part of the attic, she turned and said mysteriously,
 “Up here we can all turn back the clock. Does anybody
 care to explore the past?”
The exploration began enthusiastically with Judy
 relating still more of what she remembered about
 the fountain.
“When I told Grandma about it she laughed and
 said I must have dreamed it. She said if wishes came
 true that easily she’d be living in a castle. But would
 she?” Judy wondered. “When I first remember this
 house she was still burning kerosene lamps like those
 you see on that high shelf by the window. I think
 she and Grandpa like the way they lived without
 any modern conveniences or anything.”
“I think so, too,” Lois agreed, looking around the
 old attic with a shiver. “It is strange they both died
 the same winter, isn’t it?”
“Maybe they wanted it that way. Maybe they
 wished neither of them would outlive the other. If
 they did wish in the fountain,” Judy went on more
 thoughtfully, “I’m sure that was one of their wishes.
 Another could have been to keep the good old days,
 as Grandma used to call them. That one came true
 in a way. They did manage to keep a little of the
 past when they kept all these old things. That’s what
 I meant about turning back the clock.”
“If wishes came true I’d like to turn it back a little
 myself,” Lorraine began. “It would be nice if things
 were the way they used to be when I trusted
 Arthur—”
“Don’t you trust him now?” Judy asked.
Afterwards she was sorry for the interruption. Lois
 and Judy both questioned Lorraine, but that was all
 she would say. Judy wondered, as they searched
 through the old magazines, what was wrong. Lorraine
 was of a jealous disposition. Was the green-eyed
 monster coming between her and her handsome husband,
 Arthur Farringdon-Pett? Until now they had
 seemed blissfully happy. But there was no happiness
 in Lorraine’s face as she gazed at a picture of one of
 the fountains and then said in a tight little voice, “It
 is. It’s the very same one.”
“But that’s the picture I’ve been searching for!”
 Judy said eagerly. “Do you know where it is?”
“I can’t be sure. But if it ever was enchanted, I’m
 sure it isn’t now. Let’s go,” Lorraine said suddenly
 to Lois. Judy knew she was suggesting a fast trip home.
 But, apparently, Lois did not understand it that way.
 If she did, she pretended not to.
“Where?” she asked. “To the fountain? I’d love
 to, wouldn’t you, Judy?”
“I certainly would,” Judy replied enthusiastically.
 “Do you recognize it, too?”
“I think so,” Lois answered after studying a little
 more closely the picture they had found. “It looks
 like the fountain on the Brandt estate.”
“The department store Brandts?” Judy questioned.
 “Then my grandparents must have driven old Fanny
 all the way to Farringdon.”
“Not quite all the way,” Lorraine objected. “The
 Brandts own that stretch of woods just before you
 come into the city. You’ve passed it lots of times.”
“Of course,” agreed Judy. She put the magazine
 back in its place under the eaves and turned eagerly
 to her friends. “I do remember a road turning off
 into the woods and going on uphill,” she told them.
 “I never thought it led to a house, though. There
 isn’t even a gate. Could that be the road my grandparents
 took?”
“Why don’t we take it ourselves and find out?”
 Lois suggested.
CHAPTER III
A Strange Encounter
Lorraine was not too enthusiastic about the proposed
 trip to the Brandt estate. Finally she agreed to
 it under one condition. They were not to drive all
 the way to the house which, she said, was just over
 the hilltop. They were to park the car where no
 one would see it and follow the path to the fountain.
“But suppose we can’t find the path?” asked Judy.
“You’ll remember it, won’t you?”
Judy thought she would, but she wasn’t too sure.
 She and Lois both argued that it would be better to
 inquire at the house. Lois knew Helen Brandt slightly.
“She’d be glad to show us around. This way it
 looks as if we’re planning a crime,” Lois said as they
 started off in the blue car she was driving.
It was a neat little car, not too conspicuous, and
 easy to park in out-of-the-way places. Judy laughed
 and said if they did find the fountain she thought
 she’d wish for one exactly like it.
“Well, you know what your grandmother said
 about wishes, don’t you?” Lorraine asked. “If you
 let people know about them instead of muttering
 them to yourself most of them aren’t so impossible.”
“Quite true,” Judy agreed. “I’ll let Peter know
 about this one. He’s my Santa Claus, and it will soon
 be Christmas. Maybe I should have worn the fur
 coat he gave me last year.”
“Your reversible’s better in case it rains. It’s too
 warm for snow. We picked a perfect day for this
 trip,” Lois continued, guiding the car around curves
 as it climbed the steep hill beyond Dry Brook Hollow.
The trip was a short one. In twenty minutes they
 had covered the distance that had seemed such a
 long way to Judy when she was riding in her grandfather’s
 wagon.
“I’ve been thinking about it,” she said, “and I’ve
 just about figured out how it happened. I didn’t
 think my grandparents knew the Brandts well enough
 to pay them a visit, though. We must have looked
 queer driving up to a beautiful estate in Grandpa’s
 old farm wagon. I do remember that Grandma had
 some hooked rugs to deliver. But that still doesn’t
 explain what happened afterwards. When I woke
 up in the hammock I was alone in the garden. Horse,
 wagon, grandparents—all had disappeared.”
“How could they?” asked Lois.
“Anyway,” Lorraine began, “you had a chance to
 see how beautiful everything was before—”
Again she broke off as if there were something
 she wanted to tell but didn’t quite dare.
“Before what?” questioned Judy.
“Oh, nothing. Forget I said anything about it. You
 were telling us how you woke up in the hammock,
 but you never did explain how you got back home,”
 Lorraine reminded her.
“Didn’t I?” asked Judy. “I’d forgotten a lot of it,
 but it’s beginning to come back now. I do remember
 driving home along this road. You see, I thought my
 grandparents had left me in the garden for a surprise
 and would return for me. I told you I was all alone.
 There wasn’t a house in sight.”
“The Brandt house is just over the top of this next
 hill,” Lois put in.
“I know. You told me that. Now I know why I
 couldn’t see it. All I could see was a windowless old
 tower and a path leading in that direction. Naturally,
 I followed it. There’s something about a path in
 the woods that always tempts me.”
“We know that, Judy. Honey told us all about
 your latest mystery. You followed a trail or something.”
“Well, this trail led out of the rose garden where
 the hammock was and then through an archway,”
 Judy continued. “All sorts of little cupids and gnomes
 peered out at me from unexpected places. I was
 actually scared by the time I reached the old tower.
 There wasn’t time to explore it. Just then I heard
 the rumble of my grandfather’s wagon and knew he
 was driving off without me.”
“He was!” Judy’s friends both chorused in surprise,
 and Lois asked, “Why would he do a thing like
 that?”
“I think now it was just to tease me. He did stop
 and wait for me after a while,” Judy remembered.
 “The rugs were gone. Grandma must have delivered
 them, but I didn’t ask where. If she made them for
 Mrs. Brandt they may still be there.”
“I wouldn’t depend on it,” Lorraine said as they
 turned up the narrow road to the Brandt estate.
“Watch out!” Judy suddenly exclaimed. “There’s
 another car coming.”
As Lois swerved to avoid the oncoming car, Lorraine
 ducked her head. She kept herself hidden behind
 Judy until the car had passed. The man driving
 it was a stranger to Judy, but she would remember
 his hypnotic, dark eyes and swarthy complexion for a
 long time. The soft brown hat he was wearing covered
 most of his hair.
“What’s the matter with you two?” asked Lois
 when the car had passed. “Aren’t you a little old for
 playing hide and seek?”
“I wasn’t—playing. Let’s not go up there,” Lorraine
 begged. “I don’t think the Brandts live there
 any more.”
“Maybe not, but we can pretend we think they do,
 can’t we?” Judy replied a little uncertainly.
She was beginning to suspect that Lorraine knew
 more about the Brandt estate than she was telling.
Lois kept on driving along the narrow, gravelly
 road. Soon there were more evergreens and a hedge
 of rhododendrons to be seen. They looked very
 green next to the leafless trees in the woods beyond.
 The sky was gray with white clouds being driven
 across it by the wind.
“There’s the tower!” Lorraine exclaimed. “I can
 see it over to the left. It looks like something out of
 Grimm’s Fairy Tales, doesn’t it?”
“It looks grim all right,” agreed Judy. “I wonder
 what it is.”
“I suppose it’s nothing but an old water tower. It
 would be fun to explore it, though,” Lois said. “But
 if there are new people living here they’ll never give
 us permission.”
“We might explore it without permission,” Judy
 suggested daringly. “Come on!” she urged her friends
 as Lois parked the car in a cleared place beside the
 road. “Who’s going to stop us? And who wants to
 explore a gloomy old tower, anyway? Let’s look for
 the fountain.”
“Do you think we should?” Lorraine asked. “It
 won’t be enchanted. I told you—”
“You told us very little,” Lois reminded her. “If
 you know anything about the people who live here
 now, I think you ought to let us know. Otherwise,
 I’m afraid we won’t be very welcome.”
“I don’t think they’ll welcome us, anyway. I do
 know who they are,” Lorraine admitted. “You remember
 Roger Banning from school, don’t you?
 I’ve seen him around here. His family must have
 acquired sudden wealth, or else he’s just working on
 the estate.”
“Then you’ve been here lately? Why didn’t you
 tell me?” asked Lois. “We always used to go places
 together.”
“It wasn’t important,” Lorraine replied evasively.
 “I was just out for a drive.”
“You plutocrats!” laughed Judy. “Each with a
 car of your own. You’re not interested in Roger
 Banning, are you, Lois? I’m sure you can do better
 than that. I did know him slightly, but not from
 school. The boys and girls were separated and went
 to different high schools by the time we moved to
 Farringdon. I remember his pal, Dick Hartwell, a
 lot better. He was in our young people’s group at
 church.”
“Sh!” Lois cautioned her. “Nice people no longer
 mention Dick Hartwell’s name. He’s doing time.”
“For what?” asked Judy.
Like Peter, her FBI husband, she preferred facts
 to gossip.
“Forgery, I guess. He stole some checkbooks from
 his father’s desk and forged the names of a lot of important
 business people. I think he forged some legal
 documents, too. Anyway, he went to the Federal Penitentiary.
 It was all in the papers,” Lorraine told her.
Now Judy did remember. It was something she
 would have preferred to forget. She liked to think
 she was a good judge of character, and she had taken
 Dick Hartwell for a quiet, refined boy who would
 never stoop to crime.
“I don’t see what all this has to do with the fountain,”
 Lois said impatiently. “Are we going to look
 for it, or aren’t we?”
“Of course we are. That’s what we came for. I
 just like to know what a tiger looks like before he
 springs at me,” Judy explained.
“You seem to think there’s danger in this expedition
 of ours, don’t you?” asked Lorraine.
“I don’t know what to think. You’re the one who
 seems to know the answers, but you’re not telling.
 Hiding your face back there gave you away. You’ve
 seen that character who drove down this road and,
 for some reason, you were afraid he would see you.
 Why, Lorraine? Why didn’t you want to be recognized?”
Lorraine hesitated a moment and then replied
 evasively, “People don’t generally enter private
 estates without an invitation. That’s all.”
“I’d better turn the car around,” Lois decided,
 “in case we have to leave in a hurry. I don’t expect
 we’ll encounter any tigers, but we may be accused
 of trespassing.”
“I’m sure we will be,” announced Judy as two
 dark-coated figures strode down the road toward
 them. “You drove right by a
 NO TRESPASSING
 sign,
 and this isn’t a welcoming committee coming to
 meet us!”

There should be an epitaph for every

 man, big or little, but a really grand

 and special one for Loner Charlie.

Charles turned over on his side to look at her. She lay quietly in the
 other bed, the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She was blonde to
 perfection, exquisitely shaped, and the rich promise of her body was
 exposed to his view.


 ""Why?"" he thought as he looked at her. ""Why did it have to happen like
 this?""


 The whole thing was still like a dream to him, and as yet he couldn't
 decide whether it was a good or a bad dream. A year ago she had been
 unattainable, a face to conjure with in erotic dreams, far beyond his
 ken. A year ago she had been a public idol, the most popular actress of
 the day. And he had been a nobody, full of a nobody's idle hopes and
 schemes.


 And now he was lying in the bed next to hers in her swank Manhattan
 apartment in the most exclusive hotel in town. The unrealness of the
 situation overwhelmed him. His mind was a picture of confused thoughts.
 Meanings and answers to his questions slithered out of his reach.


 ""God,"" he said. It was not an exclamation, nor yet an expletive. It was
 a mere statement of fact.


 A thought teased at him. Charles looked at the woman again and decided
 that she still looked beautiful in spite of the harshness of the
 room's lighting. He touched buttons by the edge of the bed and the
 illumination quieted to a soft glow, wrapping her in a radiant halo.
 Charles smiled wanly and got up. He stood by the bed looking at her.


 ""I could have fallen in love with you once. A year ago, perhaps, or
 longer. But not now. Not now."" He turned away and walked to the window.
 ""Now the world is dead. The whole world is dead.""


 New York lay quietly below him. It was the hour of indecision when
 day has not quite made up its mind to leave and night has not yet
 attacked in force. The streetlights were already on, making geometric
 patterns through the dusk of Central Park. Some of the billboards were
 shining, their relays activated by darkness-sensitized solenoids. A
 reddish-orange pallor hung from the sky.


 It had been very pleasant that afternoon. She had given of herself
 freely, warmly, and Charles had accepted. But then he had known
 that she would. It was not him, it was the circumstances. Under the
 circumstances, she would have given herself to any man—


 ""Why did it have to be her—or me? Why should it have to happen to
 anybody! Why!""
She would have given herself to any man—
His thoughts beat a rapid crescendo, activating emotions, stimulating
 sensations of angry rage. He wanted to cry, to weep angry tears of
 protest.


 To any man, WHO HAPPENED TO BE THE LAST MAN ON EARTH!


 Charles picked up a heavy book end off the table and crashed it through
 the thick pane of window glass.


 A gust of wind from the outside breezed through the shattered opening,
 attacking his olfactory patch with the retching smell of decaying
 flesh. Charles ignored it. Even smells had lost their customary
 meanings.


 He felt the rage build up inside again, tearing at his viscera. His
 stomach clenched up like an angry fist.


 ""But I don't want to be the last man alive!"" he shouted. ""I don't know
 what to do! I don't know where to go, how to act! I just don't know—""


 A paroxysm of sobbing shook his body. Trembling, he dropped to his
 knees, his head against the cold firmness of the sill, his hands
 clutched tightly around the jagged edges of the window pane. In spite
 of the sharp pain that raced through his system, in spite of the
 bright, warm, red stream that trickled down his face, he knelt by the
 window for several minutes.


 ""
Maybe I'm not the last!
""


 The thought struck him with suddenness, promisingly, edged with
 swelling comfort to fill his emptiness.


 Charles got up slowly, noticing for the first time that his fingers
 were badly cut. He wrapped a handkerchief around them and forgot them.
 He had to know—he had to find out.
As he turned to leave, he noticed again the woman lying in radiant
 state upon the bed. He walked to her side and leaned over, kissing her
 gently on the forehead. As he straightened up, his leg caught against
 her arm, pushing it slightly. The woman's arm slipped from its position
 and dangled from the edge of the bed like a crazy pendulum. Charles
 picked it up and folded it across her now cold breasts. He started
 to pull the sheet over her nude form, then stopped, smiling at his
 conventionality. After all, it didn't make any difference now.


 The phonograph was near the door. On sudden impulse he switched it
 on, turned the volume up full, and in grim jest left it playing
 Rachmaninoff's
Isle of the Dead
on full automatic. The music haunted
 him down the hall to the elevator that he had to run himself.


 The lobby was littered with debris, human and otherwise. Charles
 ignored it. The street that led towards the Bureau of Vital Statistics
 was a mess of desolate carnage. Charles overlooked it. Shop fronts
 smashed, stores looted, gyro-cars wrecked, proud buildings defaced.


 ""That was it,"" he said to himself. ""Pride. We called this the 'Proud
 Era.' Everything was better and bigger and nicer to have. Buildings
 were taller, men were healthier, most of the problems of humanity
 seemed licked, or nearly so. It was a time of free power, each small
 unit of population, each section of town operating on perpetual,
 ever-lasting, automatic atomic piles.


 ""We were free. We seemed, almost, to have accomplished something. The
 world was running well. No wonder we called it the 'Proud Era.' Life
 was fun, just a bowl of cherries, until....""


 Two years ago the animals had started dying. Strangely enough the
 rats had gone first, to anybody's notice. Sales of poison dropped,
 scientific laboratories chained to a perpetual rodent-cycle began to
 complain bitterly.


 Then the lovers who hunted out and haunted the lonely lanes through the
 countryside began to remark that the locusts were late that year. The
 Southern states joyously reported that mosquito control was working to
 an unprecedented degree. The largest cotton crop ever was forecast and
 rumors from Mexico had it that no one had died from scorpion bite in
 several weeks.


 A month later the meat animals, the birds and the household pets
 began dropping as rapidly as the flies which had dropped earlier.
 Congress was called into special session, as were all of the national
 governments around the world. The U.N. met at emergency sessions to
 cope with the situation. The president of the world-wide Society for
 the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals committed suicide.


 Within a year it was obvious to everyone that man was the only animal
 left on earth.


 The panic which had begun with the death of the animals was quieted
 somewhat by the fact that humans seemed immune to the pandemic. But the
 lakes full of dead fish caused a great stink and residents along the
 coasts began to move inland. Sales of perfumes and deodorants soared.


 Then just one year ago, the first human became infected with the
 strange malady. Within six months, half of the world's population was
 gone. Less than a month ago no more than a few thousand people remained
 in New York. And now....


 ""I've got to find out,"" Charles told himself. He meant it, of course,
 but in a sense he was afraid—afraid that his trip to the Bureau might
 give him an answer he didn't dare listen to. ""But I've got to try."" He
 walked on down the bloody street.


 Before the plague the Bureau of Vital Statistics had been one of man's
 crowning achievements. Housed as it was in a huge metallic globe of
 a building, it contained computers which kept exact account of every
 human on earth.


 Compulsory registration and the classification of each individual by
 means of the discrete patterns of his brain waves had accomplished for
 man what no ordinary census could have. The machine knew who was alive,
 who was dead, and where everybody was.


 Once a year the Bureau issued The Index, an exact accounting of Earth's
 four billion inhabitants. Four billion names and addresses, compressed
 into microprint, a tremendous achievement even for the ""Proud Era.""
 In all of his life, Charles had never once glanced at The Index.
 The average person had little necessity to do so since the Bureau
 information service would answer questions free of charge at any time.


 Reaching the gigantic building, Charles pushed aside the body of a
 young man and walked into the main foyer. Passing behind once-guarded
 doors, he entered the giant computer room and paused in admiration.
Only once, before the plague, had he seen the interior of this room.
 But he still remembered it and he still recalled the powerful emotional
 experience it had been those many years ago.


 All children had to have a brain-wave recording made by the Bureau
 during the first month of their life. And again at the age of 10 each
 child returned to the Bureau for a recheck. It was for this latter
 recording that Charles had come to the Bureau some twenty-two years
 before and a friendly guard had let him peep briefly into the computer
 room. The impression of intense activity, of organized confusion, of
 mechanical wonder had remained with him the rest of his life.


 ""So different now,"" he thought, surveying the room. ""Now it's empty, so
 empty."" The machine seemed to reflect the stillness, the very deadness
 of the world. The silence became unbearable.


 Charles walked to the master control panel. With newly acquired
 dexterity he switched the computer screens on and watched them glow
 to life. All around the world sensitive receiving stations pulsed to
 activity, sending out searching fingers, hunting for elusive patterns
 of neutral energy, mapping and tabulating the results.


 The main computer screen dominated one wall of the room. Other smaller
 screens clustered around it. On these screens could be graphed the
 population of any and every part of the globe. An illuminated counter
 immediately above it would give the numerical strength of the area
 being sampled while the screen would show population density by
 individual pinpoints of light that merged to form brightness patterns.


 ""I'll try New York first,"" he said to himself, knowing that he was a
 coward, afraid to check the whole world from the start. ""I'll start
 with New York and work up.""


 Charles activated the switches that would flash a schematic map of New
 York on the screen. ""There's bound to be somebody else left here. After
 all, there were at least twenty of us just a couple of days ago."" And
 one of them, a beautiful woman, had invited him up to her apartment,
 not because she liked him, but because....


 The main screen focused itself, the patterns shifting into a
 recognizable perceptual image.


 ""Why, it was just yesterday (or was it the day before?) that ten of
 us, at least, met here to check the figures. There were lots of us
 alive then."" Including the blond young woman who had died just this
 afternoon....


 Charles stopped talking and forced his eyes upwards. Peripheral vision
 caught first the vague outlines of the lower part of the map. His eyes
 continued to move, slowly, reluctantly. They caught the over-all relief
 of Greater New York City—and then concentrated on the single, shining
 dot at the very heart of the map—and he understood.


 His eyes stabbed quickly for the counter above the screen.


 One.


 He gasped.


 The counter read
one
.


 Charles was by himself, the last person alive in all of New York City.


 He began to tremble violently. The silence of the room began to press
 quickly in on him. His frantic fingers searched for the computer
 controls.


 New York State. One.


 The entire United States. One.


 The western hemisphere, including islands.


 (Was that a point of light in Brazil? No. Just a ghost image).


 One.


 The Pacific area, Asia, Australia, Asia Minor, Russia and the Near
 East, Africa and then Europe.


 England!


 There was a light in England! Someone else still lived! The counter
 clicked forward.


 Two!


 His trembling stopped. He breathed again.


 ""Of course. London was at least as populous as New York City before the
 plague. It's only logical that—""


 He stopped. For even as he spoke, the light winked out! The counter
 clicked again.


 One.


 Alone.


 Alone!


 Charles screamed.


 The bottom dropped out from under him!
Why?


 Such a simple question, but in those three letters lay the essence of
 human nature. Why. The drive of curiosity. Stronger, in a way, than
 the so-called ""basic"" drives: hunger, thirst, sex, shelter, warmth,
 companionship, elimination. Certainly more decisive in the history of
 the race. Man began to think, to differentiate himself from the other
 animals, when he first asked the question: ""Why?""


 But thinking about ""why"" didn't answer the question itself, Charles
 thought. He looked around him. He was sitting on a bench in Central
 Park, alone except for a few stray corpses. But the park was fairly
 free of bodies.


 ""You've got about ten minutes warning,"" he said to himself. ""I guess
 that most people wanted to die inside of something—inside of anything.
 Not out in the unprotected open.""


 The silence was like a weight hanging around his neck. Not an insect
 noise, not the chirp of a bird, not the sound of a car nor the scream
 of a plane. Not even a breeze to whisper among the leaves, he thought.
 Civilization equals life equals noise. Silence equals....


 Why. His mind kept returning to the question. Of all the people on
 earth, me. The last. Why me?


 Average, that's what he was. Height: 5'11"". Weight: 165. Age: 32.
 Status: Married, once upon a time.


 The Norm, with no significant departures, all down the line. Church
 member, but not a good one. Could that be it? Could the most normal be
 the most perfect? Had he led the best of all possible lives? Was that
 it? Had God, in His infinite wisdom and mercy, spared his life, saved
 him, singled him out because he was most nearly a saint, most nearly
 Christ-like, most nearly....


 Lies—His mind snapped back to reality. He half smiled. Saint? Christ?
 The Second Coming?


 He was no saint.


 Charles sighed.


 What about—?
Chance. That was it! The laws of probability, the bell-shaped curve,
 normal distribution, rectilinear regression. More people per square
 foot in New York than elsewhere. The first person who died was from New
 York, so the last person who gave way to the disease should come from
 here too. Spin the wheel; throw the dice; toss the coin.


 So simple to explain by the laws of chance. No need for any underlying
 assumptions about good and evil, no need for teleological arguments
 concerning cause and effect. Simply explain it by chance. Somebody had
 to be the last to go and that was—


 ""No,"" Charles said, standing up in the quiet of the spring evening.
 ""No, chance won't do it. No man can reckon with chance. The mind
 rejects such things. There must be something beyond mere accident.
 There must be!""


 He sighed slowly.


 ""So now I'm a hermit, whether or not I like it,"" he said in derision to
 the gravel path as he walked along it. ""A hermit in the midst of a city
 of millions of—No, I forgot. There aren't any more people, are there?""
 It was hard to realize, even now. ""A hermit, alone—and I haven't even
 got a cave....""


 Charles stopped walking suddenly. No cave, he thought. No place to
 sleep out the long one, no place to rest while time came to change
 things around and make them for the better. No place to hide.


 And suddenly it was the most important thing in life to him to find his
 ""cave.""


 It took him almost an hour to find the proper tools, and better than
 two hours more of hard, nighttime work to get the hole dug to his
 satisfaction. It took almost three hours to find the right sort of
 casket, durable but not too heavy for one man to handle. He carted it
 out to a grassy plot close to the center of the park where the grave
 was. He let the coffin down slowly into the depression, then piled up
 loose dirt on the sloping sides of the hole so that the rain would wash
 it down over him.


 ""I can't very well bury myself,"" he said. ""I guess it will rain after
 I'm gone."" He looked carefully down at the metallic container.


 Wait now. There was something wrong, something missing. It was—oh,
 yes, he caught it. It was the stone. There wasn't any stone to go at
 the head of the grave. ""I'll have to fix that.""


 A sheet of metal, bent double, served for the monument proper. A nearby
 tool shed yielded up a can of paint and a brush. By the glow of one of
 the streetlights Charles worked out the inscription.


 ""It ought to be something impressive,"" he thought out loud. ""Something
 fitting the occasion.""


 What did one say on these situations? There was so little chance to
 practice up for things like this. But it ought to be good, it ought to
 be proper.


 ""'In this now hallowed corner of the planet Earth—' No. That sounds
 too ... too....""


 Make it simple, he thought. And he finally wrote:
HERE LIES THE BODY OF

 THE LAST MAN ON EARTH


 Yes. That was it. Simple. Let whoever came afterwards figure out the
 rest. Let them decide. He smiled and finished the painting.


 Charles was hungry. He got up and started for one of the restaurants
 near the park. Later on, when there was more time, he'd find a piece
 of granite and move it to the plot. He could spend his free time
 carving on it, copying the inscription. He would make it into a real
 shrine; maybe he would practice up a bit and try to carve a statue to
 go with the stone.


 Somehow, though, since things were ready and it didn't make too much
 difference, it seemed to Charles that he'd probably have a long time
 to wait. ""Maybe it's just a disease, and I'm immune. I was immune to
 smallpox. The vaccination never took. That's probably it.""


 He smiled. Strange, but now he wanted very much to go on living,
 alone or not. There were things he could do, ways to keep occupied.
 He wouldn't mind it so much. But he wanted more and more desperately
 with each passing second to retain his foothold on the tenuous path of
 physical existence.


 The tantalizing thought of ""why"" puzzled its way back into his mind.
 But it seemed less pressing now that he had almost come to the
 conclusion that he would live for a long time. Later, in a few days
 perhaps, he would think about it. In a little while he'd have plenty of
 opportunity for hunting down the answer. This seemed good to him, for
 now he thought he almost had the answer, if there were an answer. He
 thought he had seen the solution peering out at him from the recesses
 of his mind, and he didn't like the expression on its face. Better to
 forget.
Charles reached the broad boulevard. There was a large cafe just across
 from him, its front window caved in by a large truck. He stumbled and
 almost fell as he stepped from the curb.


 ""Look at me, nervous as a cat.""


 He was trembling noticeably as he started across the street.


 ""I—"" He started to say something, to think something. But some hidden
 part of his mind clamped down, obscuring the thought, rejecting the
 concept.


 The tremor turned to a shake before he reached the far curb, and the
 first burst of wild pain came as he laid his shoulder against the door
 to the restaurant. This was the way the plague began, but—His mind
 quickly repressed the idea. It couldn't be the plague. He was immune!


 Another burst of pulsating, shattering pain crashed through his body,
 tearing down the defenses of his mind, putting an end of his thoughts
 of immunity. Colors flared before his eyes, a persistent, irresistible
 susurrus flooded his ears.


 He wanted to protest, but there was no one to listen to him. He
 appealed to every divinity he knew, all the time knowing it would be
 useless. His body, out of his voluntary control, tried to run off in
 all directions at once.


 Charles struggled to end his body's disorganized responses, to
 channelize all his energy into one direction. His mind came back into
 action. He set up his goal; everything else seemed irrelevant: he had
 to get back to the park, to his hermit's cave, to his long, narrow
 home. He couldn't die until then.


 Ten minutes.


 He was allotted ten minutes before the end.


 It could have been ten years or ten seconds, for now objective time
 meant nothing to him. It was not a matter of measuring seconds and
 minutes. It was a matter of forgetting time and measuring space.


 He concentrated on the grave; he forced his body to become an unwilling
 machine. While he could, he walked, forcing himself on. When his legs
 gave way, he crawled. When his knees buckled, he rolled. When his
 stomach protested, he vomited. It made no difference.


 Charles refused to think. Machines, especially half-broken machines, do
 not think; they only work. Sweating, straining, bleeding, retching, he
 pushed himself towards his goal, trying to add one final touch of grace
 and custom to the rude irrationalness of it all.


 His eyes gave out a few feet from the pit. He felt his way towards it.
 Convulsions shook his body like a cat shakes a captive mouse. He humped
 his body forward between the seizures, hands outstretched, searching
 for the grave.


 And then he was upon it. One arm reached out for grass, and clutched
 bare space instead.


 He was home.


 He gathered energy from his final reservoirs of strength for one final
 movement that would throw him headlong into the shallow grave. He
 tensed his muscles, pulled his limbs up under him and started to roll
 into the hole.


 Instantly the thought struck him with paralyzing devastation. The
 answer to it all poked its face out from the recesses of his mind and
 sapped the last bit of his energy, corroding his nerves and dying
 muscles. Now he knew, and the knowing was the end of it.


 He collapsed at the edge of the pit. Only one arm hung loosely down
 into it, swinging senseless in the air, pointing accusingly at the
 empty coffin.


 The world will end, not with a bang, nor with a whimper, but with the
 last man's anguished cry at the unreasonableness of it all.


 Charles screamed.
The large, invisible, ovular being that hung suspended over the Empire
 State Building rested from its exertion. Soon it was approached by
 another of its kind.


 ""It is finished?"" asked the second.


 ""Yes. Just now. I am resting.""


 ""I can feel the emptiness of it.""


 ""It was very good. Where were you?""


 ""On the next planet out. No beauty to it at all; no system. How was
 yours?""


 ""Beautiful,"" said the first. ""It went according to the strictest
 semantic relationship following the purest mathematical principles.
 They made it easy for me.""


 ""Good.""


 ""Well, where to now?""


 ""There's another system about four thoughts away. We're due there soon.""


 ""All right. Let's go.""


 ""What's that you have there?""


 ""Oh, this?"" replied the first. ""It's a higher neural order compendium
 the Things here made up. It's what I used.""


 ""You can't take it with you, you know. They don't allow souvenirs.""


 ""I know.""


 ""Well?""


 ""All right, all right. You're so good, see if you can compute the
 scatter probability.""


 The first being moved imperceptably and the heavy plastoid binding of
 the book disappeared. The thousands of pages dropped softly, caught
 at the wind like hungry sails, separated, and pulled by the fingers of
 gravity, went their disparate ways.
Here a page scuttled into a broken window of the Chrysler Building
 (read the names: Aabat, Aabbs, Aabbt).


 Here a page landed upright on the head of one of the library lions
 and sloughed softly to the ground (read the names: Looman, Loomana,
 Loomanabsky).


 Here another page crept in between the cracks of a pier on the
 riverfront, dropping gently to the caressing eddies of the water (read
 the names: Smith, Smitha, Smitj).


 And here two pages danced down into Central Park, pirouetted,
 promenaded, and finally came to rest against a propped-up piece of
 metal (read the names: Whit, Whita, Whitacomb).


 It was not until the dusty morning sun stirred up the breezes that they
 fluttered down into the shallow hole beneath, unnoticed. The writing on
 the metal, until then partially obscured by the papers, became legible:

Gutenberg,"PEGGY FINDS THE THEATER
I
Dramatic Dialogue
“Of course, this is no surprise to us,” Thomas Lane
 said to his daughter Peggy, who perched tensely on
 the edge of a kitchen stool. “We could hardly have
 helped knowing that you’ve wanted to be an actress
 since you were out of your cradle. It’s just that decisions
 like this can’t be made quickly.”


 “But, Dad!” Peggy almost wailed. “You just finished
 saying yourself that I’ve been thinking about
 this and wanting it for years! You can’t follow that by
 calling it a quick decision!” She turned to her mother,
 her hazel eyes flashing under a mass of dark chestnut
 curls. “Mother, you understand, don’t you?”


 Mrs. Lane smiled gently and placed her soft white
 hand on her daughter’s lean brown one. “Of course
 I understand, Margaret, and so does your father. We
 both want to do what’s best for you, not to stand in
 your way. The only question is whether the time is
 right, or if you should wait longer.”

2

 “Wait! Mother—Dad—I’m years behind already!
 The theater is full of beginners a year and even two
 years younger than I am, and girls of my age have
 lots of acting credits already. Besides, what is there to
 wait for?”


 Peggy’s father put down his coffee cup and leaned
 back in the kitchen chair until it tilted on two legs
 against the wall behind him. He took his time before
 answering. When he finally spoke, his voice was
 warm and slow.


 “Peg, I don’t want to hold up your career. I don’t
 have any objections to your wanting to act. I think—judging
 from the plays I’ve seen you in at high
 school and college—that you have a real talent. But
 I thought that if you would go on with college for
 three more years and get your degree, you would
 gain so much worth-while knowledge that you’d use
 and enjoy for the rest of your life—”


 “But not acting knowledge!” Peggy cried.


 “There’s more to life than that,” her father put in.
 “There’s history and literature and foreign languages
 and mathematics and sciences and music and art
 and philosophy and a lot more—all of them fascinating
 and all important.”


 “None of them is as fascinating as acting to me,”
 Peggy replied, “and none of them is nearly as important
 to my life.”

3

 Mrs. Lane nodded. “Of course, dear. I know just
 how you feel about it,” she said. “I would have answered
 just the same way when I was your age, except
 that for me it was singing instead of acting. But—” and
 here her pleasant face betrayed a trace of
 sadness—“but I was never able to be a singer. I guess
 I wasn’t quite good enough or else I didn’t really
 want it hard enough—to go on with all the study and
 practice it needed.”


 She paused and looked thoughtfully at her daughter’s
 intense expression, then took a deep breath before
 going on.


 “What you must realize, Margaret, is that you may
 not quite make the grade. We think you’re wonderful,
 but the theater is full of young girls whose parents
 thought they were the most talented things
 alive; girls who won all kinds of applause in high-school
 and college plays; girls who have everything
 except luck. You may be one of these girls, and if you
 are, we want you to be prepared for it. We want you
 to have something to fall back on, just in case
 you ever need it.”


 Mr. Lane, seeing Peggy’s hurt look, was quick to
 step in with reassurance. “We don’t think you’re going
 to fail, Peg. We have every confidence in you and
 your talents. I don’t see how you could miss being the
 biggest success ever—but I’m your father, not a
 Broadway critic or a play producer, and I could be
 wrong. And if I am wrong, I don’t want you to be
 hurt. All I ask is that you finish college and get a
 teacher’s certificate so that you can always find
 useful work if you have to. Then you can try your
 luck in the theater. Doesn’t that make sense?”

4

 Peggy stared at the faded linoleum on the floor for
 a few moments before answering. Then, looking first
 at her mother and then at her father, she replied
 firmly, “No, it doesn’t! It might make sense if we
 were talking about anything else but acting, but
 we’re not. If I’m ever going to try, I’ll have a better
 chance now than I will in three years. But I can see
 your point of view, Dad, and I’ll tell you what—I’ll
 make a bargain with you.”


 “What sort of bargain, Peg?” her father asked curiously.


 “If you let me go to New York now, and if I can get
 into a good drama school there, I’ll study and try to
 find acting jobs at the same time. That way I’ll still be
 going to school and I’ll be giving myself a chance.
 And if I’m not started in a career in one year, I’ll go
 back to college and get my teacher’s certificate before
 I try the theater again. How does that sound to
 you?”


 “It sounds fair enough,” Tom Lane admitted, “but
 are you so confident that you’ll see results in one
 year? After all, some of our top stars worked many
 times that long before getting any recognition.”


 “I don’t expect recognition in one year, Dad,”
 Peggy said. “I’m not that conceited or that silly. All
 I hope is that I’ll be able to get a part in that time,
 and maybe be able to make a living out of acting.
 And that’s probably asking too much. If I have to,
 I’ll make a living at something else, maybe working
 in an office or something, while I wait for parts. What
 I want to prove in this year is that I can act. If I can’t,
 I’ll come home.”

5

 “It seems to me, Tom, that Margaret has a pretty
 good idea of what she’s doing,” Mrs. Lane said. “She
 sounds sensible and practical. If she were all starry-eyed
 and expected to see her name in lights in a few
 weeks, I’d vote against her going, but I’m beginning
 to think that maybe she’s right about this being the
 best time.”


 “Oh, Mother!” Peggy shouted, jumping down from
 the stool and throwing her arms about her mother’s
 neck. “I knew you’d understand! And you understand
 too, don’t you, Dad?” she appealed.


 Her father replied in little puffs as he drew on his
 pipe to get it started. “I ... never said ... I didn’t
 ... understand you ... did I?” His pipe satisfactorily
 sending up thick clouds of fragrant smoke, he
 took it out of his mouth before continuing more
 evenly.


 “Peg, your mother and I are cautious only because
 we love you so much and want what’s going to make
 you happy. At the same time, we want to spare you
 any unnecessary unhappiness along the way. Remember,
 I’m not a complete stranger to show business.
 Before I came out here to Rockport to edit the
Eagle
,
 I worked as a reporter on one of the best papers in
 New York. I saw a lot ... I met a lot of actors and
 actresses ... and I know how hard the city often
 was for them. But I don’t want to protect you from
 life. That’s no good either. Just let me think about it
 a little longer and let me talk to your mother some
 more.”

6

 Mrs. Lane patted Peggy’s arm and said, “We won’t
 keep you in suspense long, dear. Why don’t you go
 out for a walk for a while and let us go over the situation
 quietly? We’ll decide before bedtime.”


 Peggy nodded silently and walked to the kitchen
 door, where she paused to say, “I’m just going out to
 the barn to see if Socks is all right for the night. Then
 maybe I’ll go down to Jean’s for a while.”


 As she stepped out into the soft summer dusk she
 turned to look back just in time to see her mother
 throw her a comically exaggerated wink of assurance.
 Feeling much better, Peggy shut the screen door behind
 her and started for the barn.


 Ever since she had been a little girl, the barn had
 been Peggy’s favorite place to go to be by herself and
 think. Its musty but clean scent of straw and horses
 and leather made her feel calm and alive. Breathing
 in its odor gratefully, she walked into the half-dark to
 Socks’s stall. As the little bay horse heard her coming,
 she stamped one foot and softly whinnied a greeting.
 Peggy stopped first at the bag that hung on the wall
 among the bridles and halters and took out a lump of
 sugar as a present. Then, after stroking Socks’s silky
 nose, she held out her palm with the sugar cube.
 Socks took it eagerly and pushed her nose against
 Peggy’s hand in appreciation.


 As Peggy mixed some oats and barley for her pet
 and checked to see that there was enough straw in
 the stall, she thought about her life in Rockport and
 the new life that she might soon be going to.

7

 Rockport, Wisconsin, was a fine place, as pretty a
 small town as any girl could ask to grow up in. And
 not too small, either, Peggy thought. Its 16,500 people
 supported good schools, an excellent library, and two
 good movie houses. What’s more, the Rockport Community
 College attracted theater groups and concert
 artists, so that life in the town had always been stimulating.
 And of course, all of this was in addition to the
 usual growing-up pleasures of swimming and sailing,
 movie dates, and formal dances—everything that a
 girl could want.


 Peggy had lived all her life here, knew every tree-shaded
 street, every country road, field, lake, and
 stream. All of her friends were here, friends she had
 known since her earliest baby days. It would be hard
 to leave them, she knew, but there was no doubt in
 her mind that she was going to do so. If not now, then
 as soon as she possibly could.


 It was not any dissatisfaction with her life, her
 friends, or her home that made Peggy want to leave
 Rockport. She was not running away from anything,
 she reminded herself; she was running
to
something.


 To what? To the bright lights, speeding taxis, glittering
 towers of a make-believe movie-set New York?
 Would it really be like that? Or would it be something
 different, something like the dreary side-street
 world of failure and defeat that she had also seen in
 movies?

8

 Seeing the image of herself hungry and tired, going
 from office to office looking for a part in a play,
 Peggy suddenly laughed aloud and brought herself
 back to reality, to the warm barn smell and the big,
 soft-eyed gaze of Socks. She threw her arm around
 the smooth bay neck and laid her face next to the
 horse’s cheek.


 “Socks,” she murmured, “I need some of your horse
 sense if I’m going to go out on my own! We’ll go
 for a fast run in the morning and see if some fresh air
 won’t clear my silly mind!”


 With a final pat, she left the stall and the barn behind,
 stepping out into the deepening dusk. It was
 still too early to go back to the house to see if her parents
 had reached a decision about her future. Fighting
 down an impulse to rush right into the kitchen to
 see how they were coming along, Peggy continued
 down the driveway and turned left on the slate sidewalk
 past the front porch of her family’s old farmhouse
 and down the street toward Jean Wilson’s
 house at the end of the block.


 As she walked by her own home, she noticed with
 a familiar tug at her heart how the lilac bushes on
 the front lawn broke up the light from the windows
 behind them into a pattern of leafy lace. For a moment,
 or maybe a little more, she wondered why she
 wanted to leave this. What for? What could ever be
 better?

II
Dramatic Decision
Upstairs at the Wilsons’, Peggy found Jean swathed
 in bath towels, washing her long, straight red hair,
 which was now white with lather and piled up in a
 high, soapy knot.


 “You just washed it yesterday!” Peggy said. “Are
 you doing it again—or still?”


 Jean grinned, her eyes shut tight against the soapsuds.
 “Again, I’m afraid,” she answered. “Maybe it’s
 a nervous habit!”


 “It’s a wonder you’re not bald, with all the rubbing
 you give your hair,” Peggy said with a laugh.


 “Well, if I do go bald, at least it will be with a
 clean scalp!” Jean answered with a humorous crinkle
 of her freckled nose. Taking a deep breath and puffing
 out her cheeks comically, she plunged her head
 into the basin and rinsed off the soap with a shampoo
 hose. When she came up at last, dripping-wet
 hair was tightly plastered to the back of her head.


 “There!” she announced. “Don’t I look beautiful?”

10

 After a brisk rubdown with one towel, Jean rolled
 another dry towel around her head like an Indian
 turban. Then, having wrapped herself in an ancient,
 tattered, plaid bathrobe, she led Peggy out of the
 steamy room and into her cozy, if somewhat cluttered,
 bedroom. When they had made themselves
 comfortable on the pillow-strewn daybeds, Jean came
 straight to the point.


 “So the grand debate is still going on, is it? When
 do you think they’ll make up their minds?” she asked.


 “How do you know they haven’t decided anything
 yet?” Peggy said, in a puzzled tone.


 “Oh, that didn’t take much deduction, my dear
 Watson,” Jean laughed. “If they had decided against
 the New York trip, your face would be as long as
 Socks’s nose, and it’s not half that long. And if the answer
 was yes, I wouldn’t have to wait to hear about it!
 You would have been flying around the room and
 talking a mile a minute. So I figured that nothing was
 decided yet.”


 “You know, if I were as smart as you,” Peggy said
 thoughtfully, “I would have figured out a way to convince
 Mother and Dad by now.”


 “Oh, don’t feel bad about being dumb,” Jean said in
 mock tones of comfort. “If I were as pretty and talented
 as you are, I wouldn’t need brains, either!”
 With a hoot of laughter, she rolled quickly aside on
 the couch to avoid the pillow that Peggy threw at
 her.


 A short, breathless pillow fight followed, leaving
 the girls limp with laughter and with Jean having to
 retie her towel turban. From her new position, flat on
 the floor, Peggy looked up at her friend with a rueful
 smile.

11

 “You know, I sometimes think that we haven’t
 grown up at all!” she said. “I can hardly blame my
 parents for thinking twice—and a lot more—before
 treating me like an adult.”


 “Nonsense!” Jean replied firmly. “Your parents
 know a lot better than to confuse being stuffy with
 being grown-up and responsible. And, besides, I
 know that they’re not the least bit worried about your
 being able to take care of yourself. I heard them talking
 with my folks last night, and they haven’t got a
 doubt in the world about you. But they know how
 hard it can be to get a start as an actress, and they
 want to be sure that you have a profession in case
 you don’t get a break in show business.”


 “I know,” Peggy answered. “We had a long talk
 about it this evening after dinner.” Then she told her
 friend about the conversation and her proposed “bargain”
 with her parents.


 “They both seemed to think it was fair,” she concluded,
 “and when I went out, they were talking it
 over. They promised me an answer by bedtime, and
 I’m over here waiting until the jury comes in with its
 decision. You know,” she said suddenly, sitting up
 on the floor and crossing her legs under her, “I bet
 they wouldn’t hesitate a minute if you would only
 change your mind and decide to come with me and
 try it too!”

12

 After a moment’s thoughtful silence, Jean answered
 slowly, “No, Peg. I’ve thought this all out before,
 and I know it would be as wrong for me as it is
 right for you. I know we had a lot of fun in the dramatic
 groups, and I guess I was pretty good as a
 comedienne in a couple of the plays, but I know I
 haven’t got the real professional thing—and I know
 that you have. In fact, the only professional talent I
 think I do have for the theater is the ability to recognize
 talent when I see it—and to recognize that it’s
 not there when it isn’t!”


 “But, Jean,” Peggy protested, “you can handle
 comedy and character lines as well as anyone I
 know!”


 Jean nodded, accepting the compliment and seeming
 at the same time to brush it off. “That doesn’t
 matter. You know even better than I that there’s a lot
 more to being an actress—a successful one—than
 reading lines well. There’s the ability to make the
 audience sit up and notice you the minute you walk
 on, whether you have lines or not. And that’s something
 you can’t learn; you either have it, or you
 don’t. It’s like being double-jointed. I can make an
 audience laugh when I have good lines, but you can
 make them look at you and respond to you and be
 with you all the way, even with bad lines. That’s
 why you’re going to go to New York and be an actress.
 And that’s why I’m not.”


 “But, Jean—” Peggy began.

13

 “No buts!” Jean cut in. “We’ve talked about this
 enough before, and I’m not going to change my
 mind. I’m as sure about what I want as you are about
 what you want. I’m going to finish college and get my
 certificate as an English teacher.”


 “And what about acting? Can you get it out of
 your mind as easily as all that?” Peggy asked.


 “That’s the dark and devious part of my plan,”
 Jean answered with a mysterious laugh that ended in
 a comic witch’s cackle and an unconvincing witch-look
 that was completely out of place on her round,
 freckled face. “Once I get into a high school as an
 English teacher, I’m going to try to teach a special
 course in the literature of the theater and maybe another
 one in stagecraft. I’m going to work with the
 high-school drama group and put on plays. That way,
 I’ll be in a spot where I can use my special talent of
 recognizing talent. And that way,” she added, becoming
 much more serious, “I have a chance really to
 do something for the theater. If I can help and encourage
 one or two people with real talent like yours,
 then I’ll feel that I’ve really done something worth
 while.”


 Peggy nodded silently, not trusting herself to
 speak for fear of saying something foolishly sentimental,
 or even of crying. Her friend’s earnestness about
 the importance of her work and her faith in Peggy’s
 talent had touched her more than she could say.

14

 The silence lasted what seemed a terribly long
 time, until Jean broke it by suddenly jumping up and
 flinging a last pillow which she had been hiding behind
 her back. Running out of the bedroom, she
 called, “Come on! I’ll race you down to the kitchen
 for cocoa! By the time we’re finished, it’ll be about
 time for your big Hour of Decision scene!”
It was nearly ten o’clock when Peggy finally felt
 that her parents had had enough time to talk things
 out. Leaving the Wilson house, she walked slowly
 despite her eagerness, trying in all fairness to give her
 mother and father every minute she could. Reaching
 her home, she cut across the lawn behind the lilac
 bushes, to the steps up to the broad porch that
 fronted the house. As she climbed the steps, she
 heard her father’s voice raised a little above its normal
 soft, deep tone, but she could not make out the
 words.


 Crossing the porch, she caught sight of him
 through the window. He was speaking on the telephone,
 and now she caught his words.


 “Fine. Yes.... Yes—I think we can. Very
 well, day after tomorrow, then. That’s right—all
 three of us. And, May—it’ll be good to see you again,
 after all these years! Good-by.”


 As Peggy entered the room, her father put down
 the phone and turned to Mrs. Lane. “Well, Betty,”
 he said, “it’s all set.”


 “What’s all set, Dad?” Peggy said, breaking into a
 run to her father’s side.

15

 “Everything’s all set, Peg,” her father said with a
 grin. “And it’s set just the way you wanted it! There’s
 not a man in the world who can hold out against
 two determined women.” He leaned back against the
 fireplace mantel, waiting for the explosion he felt
 sure was to follow his announcement. But Peggy just
 stood, hardly moving a muscle. Then she walked
 carefully, as if she were on the deck of a rolling ship,
 to the big easy chair and slowly sat down.


 “Well, for goodness’ sake!” her mother cried.
 “Where’s the enthusiasm?”


 Peggy swallowed hard before answering. When
 her voice came, it sounded strange, about two tones
 higher than usual. “I ... I’m trying to be sedate ... and
 poised ... and very grown-up,” she said.
 “But it’s not easy. All I want to do is to—” and she
 jumped out of the chair—“to yell
whoopee
!” She
 yelled at the top of her lungs.


 After the kisses, the hugs, and the first excitement,
 Peggy and her parents adjourned to the kitchen, the
 favorite household conference room, for cookies and
 milk and more talk.


 “Now, tell me, Dad,” Peggy asked, her mouth full
 of oatmeal cookies, no longer “sedate” or “poised,”
 but her natural, bubbling self. “Who was that on the
 phone, and where are the three of us going, and
 what’s all set?”

16

 “One thing at a time,” her father said. “To begin
 with, we decided almost as soon as you left that we
 were going to let you go to New York to try a year’s
 experience in the theater. But then we had to decide
 just where you would live, and where you should
 study, and how much money you would need, and a
 whole lot of other things. So I called New York to talk
 to an old friend of mine who I felt would be able to
 give us some help. Her name is May Berriman, and
 she’s spent all her life in the theater. In fact, she was
 a very successful actress. Now she’s been retired for
 some years, but I thought she might give us some
 good advice.”


 “And did she?” Peggy asked.


 “We were luckier than I would have thought possible,”
 Mrs. Lane put in. “It seems that May bought a
 big, old-fashioned town house and converted it into
 a rooming house especially for young actresses. She
 always wanted a house of her own with a garden in
 back, but felt it was foolish for a woman living alone.
 This way, she can afford to run a big place and at
 the same time not be alone. And best of all, she says
 she has a room that you can have!”


 “Oh, Mother! It sounds wonderful!” Peggy exulted.
 “I’ll be with other girls my own age who are actresses,
 and living with an experienced actress! I’ll bet she
 can teach me loads!”


 “I’m sure she can,” her father said. “And so can
 the New York Dramatic Academy.”


 “Dad!” Peggy shouted, almost choking on a cooky.
 “Don’t tell me you’ve managed to get me accepted
 there! That’s the best dramatic school in the country!
 How—?”

17

 “Don’t get too excited, Peg,” Mr. Lane interrupted.
 “You’re not accepted anywhere yet, but May
 Berriman told me that the Academy is the best place
 to study acting, and she said she would set up an
 audition for you in two days. The term starts in a
 couple of weeks, so there isn’t much time to lose.”


 “Two days! Do you mean we’ll be going to New
 York day after tomorrow, just like that?”


 “Oh, no,” her mother answered calmly. “We’re going
 to New York tomorrow on the first plane that we
 can get seats on. Your father doesn’t believe in wasting
 time, once his mind is made up.”


 “Tomorrow?” Peggy repeated, almost unable to believe
 what she had heard. “What are we sitting here
 talking for, then? I’ve got a million things to do! I’ve
 got to get packed ... I’ve got to think of what to
 read for the audition! I can study on the plane, I
 guess, but ... oh! I’ll be terrible in a reading unless
 I can have more time! Oh, Mother, what parts
 will I do? Where’s the Shakespeare? Where’s—”


 “Whoa!” Mr. Lane said, catching Peggy’s arm to
 prevent her from rushing out of the kitchen. “Not
 now, young lady! We’ll pack in the morning, talk
 about what you should read, and take an afternoon
 plane to New York. But tonight, you’d better think
 of nothing more than getting to bed. This is going to
 be a busy time for all of us.”


 Reluctantly, Peggy agreed, recognizing the sense
 of what her father said. She finished her milk and
 cookies, kissed her parents good night and went upstairs
 to bed.


 But it was one thing to go to bed and another to
 go to sleep.

18

 Peggy lay on her back, staring at the ceiling and
 the patterns of light and shade cast by the street
 lamp outside as it shone through the leaves of the big
 maple tree. As she watched the shifting shadows,
 she reviewed the roles she had played since her first
 time in a high-school play. Which should she refresh
 herself on? Which ones would she do best? And
 which ones were most suited to her now? She recognized
 that she had grown and developed past some
 of the roles which had once seemed perfectly suited
 to her talent and her appearance. But both had
 changed. She was certainly not a mature actress
 yet, from any point of view, but neither was she a
 schoolgirl. Her trim figure was well formed; her face
 had lost the undefined, simple cuteness of the early
 teens, and had gained character. She didn’t think she
 should read a young romantic part like Juliet. Not
 that she couldn’t do it, but perhaps something
 sharper was called for.


 Perhaps Viola in
Twelfth Night
? Or perhaps not
 Shakespeare at all. Maybe the people at the Academy
 would think she was too arty or too pretentious?
 Maybe she should do something dramatic and full of
 stormy emotion, like Blanche in
A Streetcar Named
 Desire
? Or, better for her development and age, a
 light, brittle, comedy role...?

19

 Nothing seemed quite right. Peggy’s thoughts
 shifted with the shadows overhead. All the plays she
 had ever seen or read or acted in melted together in
 a blur, until the characters from one seemed to be
 talking with the characters from another and moving
 about in an enormous set made of pieces from two or
 three different plays. More actors kept coming on in
 a fantastic assortment of costumes until the stage was
 full. Then the stage lights dimmed, the actors joined
 hands across the stage to bow, the curtain slowly
 descended, the lights went out—and Peggy was fast
 asleep.

Criminals, beware; the Scorpion is on

 your trail! Hoodlums fear his fury—and,

 for that matter, so do the cops!

The man with the handkerchief mask said, ""All right, everybody, keep
 tight. This is a holdup.""


 There were twelve people in the bank. There was Mr. Featherhall at
 his desk, refusing to okay a personal check from a perfect stranger.
 There was the perfect stranger, an itinerant garage mechanic named
 Rodney (Rod) Strom, like the check said. There were Miss English and
 Miss Philicoff, the girls in the gilded teller cages. There was Mister
 Anderson, the guard, dozing by the door in his brown uniform. There was
 Mrs. Elizabeth Clayhorn, depositing her husband's pay check in their
 joint checking account, and with her was her ten-year-old son Edward
 (Eddie) Clayhorn, Junior. There was Charlie Casale, getting ten dollars
 dimes, six dollars nickels and four dollars pennies for his father
 in the grocery store down the street. There was Mrs. Dolly Daniels,
 withdrawing money from her savings account again. And there were three
 bank robbers.


 The three bank robbers looked like triplets. From the ground up, they
 all wore scuffy black shoes, baggy-kneed and unpressed khaki trousers,
 brown cracked-leather jackets over flannel shirts, white handkerchiefs
 over the lower half of their faces and gray-and-white check caps pulled
 low over their eyes. The eyes themselves looked dangerous.


 The man who had spoken withdrew a small but mean-looking thirty-two
 calibre pistol from his jacket pocket. He waved it menacingly. One of
 the others took the pistol away from Mister Anderson, the guard, and
 said to him in a low voice, ""Think about retirement, my friend."" The
 third one, who carried a black satchel like a doctor's bag, walked
 quickly around behind the teller's counter and started filling it with
 money.


 It was just like the movies.


 The man who had first spoken herded the tellers, Mr. Featherhall and
 the customers all over against the back wall, while the second man
 stayed next to Mr. Anderson and the door. The third man stuffed money
 into the black satchel.


 The man by the door said, ""Hurry up.""


 The man with the satchel said, ""One more drawer.""


 The man with the gun turned to say to the man at the door, ""Keep your
 shirt on.""


 That was all Miss English needed. She kicked off her shoes and ran
 pelting in her stocking feet for the door.
The man by the door spread his arms out and shouted, ""Hey!"" The man
 with the gun swung violently back, cursing, and fired the gun. But he'd
 been moving too fast, and so had Miss English, and all he hit was the
 brass plate on Mr. Featherhall's desk.


 The man by the door caught Miss English in a bear hug. She promptly did
 her best to scratch his eyes out. Meanwhile, Mr. Anderson went scooting
 out the front door and running down the street toward the police
 station in the next block, shouting, ""Help! Help! Robbery!""


 The man with the gun cursed some more. The man with the satchel came
 running around from behind the counter, and the man by the door tried
 to keep Miss English from scratching his eyes out. Then the man with
 the gun hit Miss English on the head. She fell unconscious to the
 floor, and all three of them ran out of the bank to the car out front,
 in which sat a very nervous-looking fourth man, gunning the engine.


 Everyone except Miss English ran out after the bandits, to watch.


 Things got very fast and very confused then. Two police cars came
 driving down the block and a half from the precinct house to the bank,
 and the car with the four robbers in it lurched away from the curb and
 drove straight down the street toward the police station. The police
 cars and the getaway car passed one another, with everybody shooting
 like the ships in pirate movies.


 There was so much confusion that it looked as though the bank robbers
 were going to get away after all. The police cars were aiming the wrong
 way and, as they'd come down with sirens wailing, there was a clear
 path behind them.


 Then, after the getaway car had gone more than two blocks, it suddenly
 started jouncing around. It smacked into a parked car and stopped. And
 all the police went running down there to clap handcuffs on the robbers
 when they crawled dazedly out of their car.


 ""Hey,"" said Eddie Clayhorn, ten years old. ""Hey, that was something,
 huh, Mom?""


 ""Come along home,"" said his mother, grabbing his hand. ""We don't want
 to be involved.""
""It was the nuttiest thing,"" said Detective-Sergeant Stevenson. ""An
 operation planned that well, you'd think they'd pay attention to their
 getaway car, you know what I mean?""


 Detective-Sergeant Pauling shrugged. ""They always slip up,"" he said.
 ""Sooner or later, on some minor detail, they always slip up.""


 ""Yes, but their
tires
.""


 ""Well,"" said Pauling, ""it was a stolen car. I suppose they just grabbed
 whatever was handiest.""


 ""What I can't figure out,"" said Stevenson, ""is exactly what made those
 tires do that. I mean, it was a hot day and all, but it wasn't
that
hot. And they weren't going that fast. I don't think you could go fast
 enough to melt your tires down.""


 Pauling shrugged again. ""We got them. That's the important thing.""


 ""Still and all, it's nutty. They're free and clear, barrelling out
 Rockaway toward the Belt, and all at once their tires melt, the tubes
 blow out and there they are."" Stevenson shook his head. ""I can't figure
 it.""


 ""Don't look a gift horse in the mouth,"" suggested Pauling. ""They picked
 the wrong car to steal.""


 ""And
that
doesn't make sense, either,"" said Stevenson. ""Why steal a
 car that could be identified as easily as that one?""


 ""Why? What was it, a foreign make?""


 ""No, it was a Chevvy, two-tone, three years old, looked just like half
 the cars on the streets. Except that in the trunk lid the owner had
 burned in 'The Scorpion' in big black letters you could see half a
 block away.""


 ""Maybe they didn't notice it when they stole the car,"" said Pauling.


 ""For a well-planned operation like this one,"" said Stevenson, ""they
 made a couple of really idiotic boners. It doesn't make any sense.""


 ""What do they have to say about it?"" Pauling demanded.


 ""Nothing, what do you expect? They'll make no statement at all.""


 The squad-room door opened, and a uniformed patrolman stuck his head
 in. ""The owner of that Chevvy's here,"" he said.


 ""Right,"" said Stevenson. He followed the patrolman down the hall to the
 front desk.


 The owner of the Chevvy was an angry-looking man of middle age, tall
 and paunchy. ""John Hastings,"" he said. ""They say you have my car here.""


 ""I believe so, yes,"" said Stevenson. ""I'm afraid it's in pretty bad
 shape.""


 ""So I was told over the phone,"" said Hastings grimly. ""I've contacted
 my insurance company.""


 ""Good. The car's in the police garage, around the corner. If you'd come
 with me?""
On the way around, Stevenson said, ""I believe you reported the car
 stolen almost immediately after it happened.""


 ""That's right,"" said Hastings. ""I stepped into a bar on my route. I'm
 a wine and liquor salesman. When I came out five minutes later, my car
 was gone.""


 ""You left the keys in it?""


 ""Well, why not?"" demanded Hastings belligerently. ""If I'm making just
 a quick stop—I never spend more than five minutes with any one
 customer—I always leave the keys in the car. Why not?""


 ""The car was stolen,"" Stevenson reminded him.


 Hastings grumbled and glared. ""It's always been perfectly safe up till
 now.""


 ""Yes, sir. In here.""


 Hastings took one look at his car and hit the ceiling. ""It's ruined!""
 he cried. ""What did you do to the tires?""


 ""Not a thing, sir. That happened to them in the holdup.""


 Hastings leaned down over one of the front tires. ""Look at that!
 There's melted rubber all over the rims. Those rims are ruined! What
 did you use, incendiary bullets?""


 Stevenson shook his head. ""No, sir. When that happened they were two
 blocks away from the nearest policeman.""


 ""Hmph."" Hastings moved on around the car, stopping short to exclaim,
 ""What in the name of God is that? You didn't tell me a bunch of
kids
had stolen the car.""


 ""It wasn't a bunch of kids,"" Stevenson told him. ""It was four
 professional criminals, I thought you knew that. They were using it in
 a bank holdup.""


 ""Then why did they do
that
?""


 Stevenson followed Hastings' pointing finger, and saw again the
 crudely-lettered words, ""The Scorpion"" burned black into the paint of
 the trunk lid. ""I really don't know,"" he said. ""It wasn't there before
 the car was stolen?""


 ""Of course not!""


 Stevenson frowned. ""Now, why in the world did they do that?""


 ""I suggest,"" said Hastings with heavy sarcasm, ""you ask them that.""


 Stevenson shook his head. ""It wouldn't do any good. They aren't talking
 about anything. I don't suppose they'll ever tell us."" He looked at the
 trunk lid again. ""It's the nuttiest thing,"" he said thoughtfully....


 That was on Wednesday.


 The Friday afternoon mail delivery to the
Daily News
brought a crank
 letter. It was in the crank letter's most obvious form; that is,
 the address had been clipped, a letter or a word at a time, from a
 newspaper and glued to the envelope. There was no return address.


 The letter itself was in the same format. It was brief and to the point:


 Dear Mr. Editor:


 The Scorpion has struck. The bank robbers were captured. The Scorpion
 fights crime. Crooks and robbers are not safe from the avenging
 Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS!
Sincerely yours,

 THE SCORPION


 The warning was duly noted, and the letter filed in the wastebasket. It
 didn't rate a line in the paper.
II


 The bank robbery occurred in late June. Early in August, a Brooklyn man
 went berserk.


 It happened in Canarsie, a section in southeast Brooklyn near Jamaica
 Bay. This particular area of Canarsie was a residential neighborhood,
 composed of one and two family houses. The man who went berserk was a
 Motor Vehicle Bureau clerk named Jerome Higgins.


 Two days before, he had flunked a Civil Service examination for the
 third time. He reported himself sick and spent the two days at home,
 brooding, a bottle of blended whiskey at all times in his hand.


 As the police reconstructed it later, Mrs. Higgins had attempted to
 awaken him on the third morning at seven-thirty, suggesting that he
 really ought to stop being so foolish, and go back to work. He then
 allegedly poked her in the eye, and locked her out of the bedroom.


 Mrs. Higgins then apparently called her sister-in-law, a Mrs. Thelma
 Stodbetter, who was Mr. Higgins' sister. Mrs. Stodbetter arrived at the
 house at nine o'clock, and spent some time tapping at the still-locked
 bedroom door, apparently requesting Mr. Higgins to unlock the door and
 ""stop acting like a child."" Neighbors reported to the police that they
 heard Mr. Higgins shout a number of times, ""Go away! Can't you let a
 man sleep?""


 At about ten-fifteen, neighbors heard shots from the Higgins residence,
 a two-story one-family pink stucco affair in the middle of a block of
 similar homes. Mr. Higgins, it was learned later, had suddenly erupted
 from his bedroom, brandishing a .30-.30 hunting rifle and, being
 annoyed at the shrieks of his wife and sister, had fired seven shells
 at them, killing his wife on the spot and wounding his sister in the
 hand and shoulder.


 Mrs. Stodbetter, wounded and scared out of her wits, raced screaming
 out the front door of the house, crying for the police and shouting,
 ""Murder! Murder!"" At this point, neighbors called the police. One
 neighbor additionally phoned three newspapers and two television
 stations, thereby earning forty dollars in ""news-tips"" rewards.
By chance, a mobile television unit was at that moment on the Belt
 Parkway, returning from having seen off a prime minister at Idlewild
 Airport. This unit was at once diverted to Canarsie, where it took up a
 position across the street from the scene of carnage and went to work
 with a Zoomar lens.


 In the meantime, Mister Higgins had barricaded himself in his house,
 firing at anything that moved.


 The two cameramen in the mobile unit worked their hearts out. One
 concentrated on the movements of the police and firemen and neighbors
 and ambulance attendants, while the other used the Zoomar lens to
 search for Mr. Higgins. He found him occasionally, offering the at-home
 audience brief glimpses of a stocky balding man in brown trousers and
 undershirt, stalking from window to window on the second floor of the
 house.


 The show lasted for nearly an hour. There were policemen everywhere,
 and firemen everywhere, and neighbors milling around down at the
 corner, where the police had roped the block off, and occasionally Mr.
 Higgins would stick his rifle out a window and shoot at somebody. The
 police used loudspeakers to tell Higgins he might as well give up, they
 had the place surrounded and could eventually starve him out anyway.
 Higgins used his own good lungs to shout obscenities back and challenge
 anyone present to hand-to-hand combat.


 The police fired tear gas shells at the house, but it was a windy day
 and all the windows in the Higgins house were either open or broken.
 Higgins was able to throw all the shells back out of the house again.


 The show lasted for nearly an hour. Then it ended, suddenly and
 dramatically.


 Higgins had showed himself to the Zoomar lens again, for the purpose of
 shooting either the camera or its operator. All at once he yelped and
 threw the rifle away. The rifle bounced onto the porch roof, slithered
 down to the edge, hung for a second against the drain, and finally fell
 barrel first onto the lawn.


 Meanwhile, Higgins was running through the house, shouting like a
 wounded bull. He thundered down the stairs and out, hollering, to fall
 into the arms of the waiting police.


 They had trouble holding him. At first they thought he was actually
 trying to get away, but then one of them heard what it was he was
 shouting: ""My hands! My hands!""


 They looked at his hands. The palms and the palm-side of the fingers
 were red and blistering, from what looked like severe burns. There was
 another burn on his right cheek and another one on his right shoulder.


 Higgins, thoroughly chastened and bewildered, was led away for burn
 ointment and jail. The television crew went on back to Manhattan. The
 neighbors went home and telephoned their friends.


 On-duty policemen had been called in from practically all of the
 precincts in Brooklyn. Among them was Detective-Sergeant William
 Stevenson. Stevenson frowned thoughtfully at Higgins as that unhappy
 individual was led away, and then strolled over to look at the rifle.
 He touched the stock, and it was somewhat warm but that was all.


 He picked it up and turned it around. There, on the other side of the
 stock, burned into the wood, were the crudely-shaped letters, ""The
 Scorpion.""
You don't get to be Precinct Captain on nothing but political
 connections. Those help, of course, but you need more than that. As
 Captain Hanks was fond of pointing out, you needed as well to be both
 more imaginative than most—""You gotta be able to second-guess the
 smart boys""—and to be a complete realist—""You gotta have both feet
 on the ground."" If these were somewhat contradictory qualities, it was
 best not to mention the fact to Captain Hanks.


 The realist side of the captain's nature was currently at the fore.
 ""Just what are you trying to say, Stevenson?"" he demanded.


 ""I'm not sure,"" admitted Stevenson. ""But we've got these two things.
 First, there's the getaway car from that bank job. The wheels melt for
 no reason at all, and somebody burns 'The Scorpion' onto the trunk.
 Then, yesterday, this guy Higgins out in Canarsie. He says the rifle
 all of a sudden got too hot to hold, and he's got the burn marks to
 prove it. And there on the rifle stock it is again. 'The Scorpion'.""


 ""He says he put that on there himself,"" said the captain.


 Stevenson shook his head. ""His
lawyer
says he put it on there.
 Higgins says he doesn't remember doing it. That's half the lawyer's
 case. He's trying to build up an insanity defense.""


 ""He put it on there himself, Stevenson,"" said the captain with weary
 patience. ""What are you trying to prove?""


 ""I don't know. All I know is it's the nuttiest thing I ever saw. And
 what about the getaway car? What about those tires melting?""


 ""They were defective,"" said Hanks promptly.


 ""All four of them at once? And what about the thing written on the
 trunk?""


 ""How do I know?"" demanded the captain. ""Kids put it on before the car
 was stolen, maybe. Or maybe the hoods did it themselves, who knows?
 What do
they
say?""


 ""They say they didn't do it,"" said Stevenson. ""And they say they never
 saw it before the robbery and they would have noticed it if it'd been
 there.""


 The captain shook his head. ""I don't get it,"" he admitted. ""What are
 you trying to prove?""


 ""I guess,"" said Stevenson slowly, thinking it out as he went along, ""I
 guess I'm trying to prove that somebody melted those tires, and made
 that rifle too hot, and left his signature behind.""


 ""What? You mean like in the comic books? Come on, Stevenson! What are
 you trying to hand me?""


 ""All I know,"" insisted Stevenson, ""is what I see.""


 ""And all
I
know,"" the captain told him, ""is Higgins put that name on
 his rifle himself. He says so.""


 ""And what made it so hot?""


 ""Hell, man, he'd been firing that thing at people for an hour! What do
 you
think
made it hot?""


 ""All of a sudden?""


 ""He noticed it all of a sudden, when it started to burn him.""


 ""How come the same name showed up each time, then?"" Stevenson asked
 desperately.


 ""How should I know? And why not, anyway? You know as well as I do these
 things happen. A bunch of teen-agers burgle a liquor store and they
 write 'The Golden Avengers' on the plate glass in lipstick. It happens
 all the time. Why not 'The Scorpion'? It couldn't occur to two people?""


 ""But there's no explanation—"" started Stevenson.


 ""What do you mean, there's no explanation? I just
gave
you the
 explanation. Look, Stevenson, I'm a busy man. You got a nutty
 idea—like Wilcox a few years ago, remember him? Got the idea there
 was a fiend around loose, stuffing all those kids into abandoned
 refrigerators to starve. He went around trying to prove it, and getting
 all upset, and pretty soon they had to put him away in the nut hatch.
 Remember?""


 ""I remember,"" said Stevenson.


 ""Forget this silly stuff, Stevenson,"" the captain advised him.


 ""Yes, sir,"" said Stevenson....


 The day after Jerome Higgins went berserk, the afternoon mail brought a
 crank letter to the
Daily News
:


 Dear Mr. Editor,


 You did not warn your readers. The man who shot all those people could
 not escape the Scorpion. The Scorpion fights crime. No criminal is
 safe from the Scorpion. WARN YOUR READERS.
Sincerely yours,

 THE SCORPION


 Unfortunately, this letter was not read by the same individual who had
 seen the first one, two months before. At any rate, it was filed in the
 same place, and forgotten.
III


 Hallowe'en is a good time for a rumble. There's too many kids around
 for the cops to keep track of all of them, and if you're picked up
 carrying a knife or a length of tire chain or something, why, you're on
 your way to a Hallowe'en party and you're in costume. You're going as a
 JD.


 The problem was this schoolyard. It was a block wide, with entrances
 on two streets. The street on the north was Challenger territory, and
 the street on the south was Scarlet Raider territory, and both sides
 claimed the schoolyard. There had been a few skirmishes, a few guys
 from both gangs had been jumped and knocked around a little, but that
 had been all. Finally, the War Lords from the two gangs had met, and
 determined that the matter could only be settled in a war.


 The time was chosen: Hallowe'en. The place was chosen: the schoolyard.
 The weapons were chosen: pocket knives and tire chains okay, but no
 pistols or zip-guns. The time was fixed: eleven P.M. And the winner
 would have undisputed territorial rights to the schoolyard, both
 entrances.


 The night of the rumble, the gangs assembled in their separate
 clubrooms for last-minute instructions. Debs were sent out to play
 chicken at the intersections nearest the schoolyard, both to warn of
 the approach of cops and to keep out any non-combatant kids who might
 come wandering through.


 Judy Canzanetti was a Deb with the Scarlet Raiders. She was fifteen
 years old, short and black-haired and pretty in a movie-magazine,
 gum-chewing sort of way. She was proud of being in the Auxiliary of the
 Scarlet Raiders, and proud also of the job that had been assigned to
 her. She was to stand chicken on the southwest corner of the street.


 Judy took up her position at five minutes to eleven. The streets were
 dark and quiet. Few people cared to walk this neighborhood after dark,
 particularly on Hallowe'en. Judy leaned her back against the telephone
 pole on the corner, stuck her hands in the pockets of her Scarlet
 Raider jacket and waited.


 At eleven o'clock, she heard indistinct noises begin behind her. The
 rumble had started.


 At five after eleven, a bunch of little kids came wandering down the
 street. They were all about ten or eleven years old, and most of them
 carried trick-or-treat shopping bags. Some of them had Hallowe'en masks
 on.


 They started to make the turn toward the schoolyard. Judy said, ""Hey,
 you kids. Take off.""


 One of them, wearing a red mask, turned to look at her. ""Who, us?""


 ""Yes, you! Stay out of that street. Go on down that way.""


 ""The subway's this way,"" objected the kid in the red mask.


 ""Who cares? You go around the other way.""
""Listen, lady,"" said the kid in the red mask, aggrieved, ""we got a long
 way to go to get home.""


 ""Yeah,"" said another kid, in a black mask, ""and we're late as it is.""


 ""I couldn't care less,"" Judy told them callously. ""You can't go down
 that street.""


 ""Why not?"" demanded yet another kid. This one was in the most complete
 and elaborate costume of them all, black leotards and a yellow shirt
 and a flowing: black cape. He wore a black and gold mask and had a
 black knit cap jammed down tight onto his head. ""Why can't we go down
 there?"" this apparition demanded.


 ""Because I said so,"" Judy told him. ""Now, you kids get away from here.
 Take off.""


 ""Hey!"" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume. ""Hey, they're
 fighting down there!""


 ""It's a rumble,"" said Judy proudly. ""You twerps don't want to be
 involved.""


 ""Hey!"" cried the kid in the black-and-yellow costume again. And he went
 running around Judy and dashing off down the street.


 ""Hey, Eddie!"" shouted one of the other kids. ""Eddie, come back!""


 Judy wasn't sure what to do next. If she abandoned her post to chase
 the one kid who'd gotten through, then maybe all the rest of them would
 come running along after her. She didn't know what to do.


 A sudden siren and a distant flashing red light solved her problems.
 ""Cheez,"" said one of the kids. ""The cops!""


 ""Fuzz!"" screamed Judy. She turned and raced down the block toward the
 schoolyard, shouting, ""Fuzz! Fuzz! Clear out, it's the fuzz!""


 But then she stopped, wide-eyed, when she saw what was going on in the
 schoolyard.


 The guys from both gangs were dancing. They were jumping around, waving
 their arms, throwing their weapons away. Then they all started pulling
 off their gang jackets and throwing them away, whooping and hollering.
 They were making such a racket themselves that they never heard Judy's
 warning. They didn't even hear the police sirens. And all at once both
 schoolyard entrances were full of cops, a cop had tight hold of Judy
 and the rumble was over.
Judy was so baffled and terrified that everything was just one great
 big blur. But in the middle of it all, she did see the little kid in
 the yellow-and-black costume go scooting away down the street.


 And she had the craziest idea that it was all his fault.
Captain Hanks was still in his realistic cycle this morning, and he was
 impatient as well. ""All right, Stevenson,"" he said. ""Make it fast, I've
 got a lot to do this morning. And I hope it isn't this comic-book thing
 of yours again.""


 ""I'm afraid it is, Captain,"" said Stevenson. ""Did you see the morning
 paper?""


 ""So what?""


 ""Did you see that thing about the gang fight up in Manhattan?""


 Captain Hanks sighed. ""Stevenson,"" he said wearily, ""are you going to
 try to connect every single time the word 'scorpion' comes up? What's
 the problem with this one? These kid gangs have names, so what?""


 ""Neither one of them was called 'The Scorpions,'"" Stevenson told
 him. ""One of them was the Scarlet Raiders and the other gang was the
 Challengers.""


 ""So they changed their name,"" said Hanks.


 ""Both gangs? Simultaneously? To the same name?""


 ""Why not? Maybe that's what they were fighting over.""


 ""It was a territorial war,"" Stevenson reminded him. ""They've admitted
 that much. It says so in the paper. And it also says they all deny ever
 seeing that word on their jackets until after the fight.""


 ""A bunch of juvenile delinquents,"" said Hanks in disgust. ""You take
 their word?""


 ""Captain, did you read the article in the paper?""


 ""I glanced through it.""


 ""All right. Here's what they say happened: They say they started
 fighting at eleven o'clock. And they just got going when all at once
 all the metal they were carrying—knives and tire chains and coins and
 belt buckles and everything else—got freezing cold, too cold to touch.
 And then their leather jackets got freezing cold, so cold they had to
 pull them off and throw them away. And when the jackets were later
 collected, across the name of the gang on the back of each one had been
 branded 'The Scorpion.'""


 ""Now, let
me
tell
you
something,"" said Hanks severely. ""They heard
 the police sirens, and they threw all their weapons away. Then they
 threw their jackets away, to try to make believe they hadn't been
 part of the gang that had been fighting. But they were caught before
 they could get out of the schoolyard. If the squad cars had showed
 up a minute later, the schoolyard wouldn't have had anything in it
 but weapons and jackets, and the kids would have been all over the
 neighborhood, nice as you please, minding their own business and not
 bothering anybody.
That's
what happened. And all this talk about
 freezing cold and branding names into jackets is just some smart-alec
 punk's idea of a way to razz the police. Now, you just go back to
 worrying about what's happening in this precinct and forget about kid
 gangs up in Manhattan and comic book things like the Scorpion, or
 you're going to wind up like Wilcox, with that refrigerator business.
 Now, I don't want to hear any more about this nonsense, Stevenson.""


 ""Yes, sir,"" said Stevenson.

 HUNTED

 HEROES
By ROBERT SILVERBERG
The planet itself was tough enough—barren, desolate,
 forbidding; enough to stop the most adventurous and
 dedicated. But they had to run head-on against a mad
 genius who had a motto:
Death to all Terrans!
""Let's
 keep moving,"" I told
 Val. ""The surest way to
 die out here on Mars is to
 give up."" I reached over and
 turned up the pressure on her
 oxymask to make things a
 little easier for her. Through
 the glassite of the mask, I
 could see her face contorted
 in an agony of fatigue.


 And she probably thought
 the failure of the sandcat was
 all my fault, too. Val's usually
 about the best wife a guy
 could ask for, but when she
 wants to be she can be a real
 flying bother.


 It was beyond her to see
 that some grease monkey back
 at the Dome was at fault—whoever
 it was who had failed
 to fasten down the engine
 hood. Nothing but what had
 stopped us
could
stop a sandcat:
 sand in the delicate
 mechanism of the atomic engine.


 But no; she blamed it all on
 me somehow: So we were out
 walking on the spongy sand
 of the Martian desert. We'd
 been walking a good eight
 hours.


 ""Can't we turn back now,
 Ron?"" Val pleaded. ""Maybe
 there isn't any uranium in
 this sector at all. I think
 we're crazy to keep on searching
 out here!""


 I started to tell her that the
 UranCo chief had assured me
 we'd hit something out this
 way, but changed my mind.
 When Val's tired and overwrought
 there's no sense in
 arguing with her.


 I stared ahead at the bleak,
 desolate wastes of the Martian
 landscape. Behind us
 somewhere was the comfort
 of the Dome, ahead nothing
 but the mazes and gullies of
 this dead world.
He was a cripple in a wheelchair—helpless as a rattlesnake.
""Try to keep going, Val.""
 My gloved hand reached out
 and clumsily enfolded hers.
 ""Come on, kid. Remember—we're
 doing this for Earth.
 We're heroes.""


 She glared at me. ""Heroes,
 hell!"" she muttered. ""That's
 the way it looked back home,
 but, out there it doesn't seem
 so glorious. And UranCo's
 pay is stinking.""


 ""We didn't come out here
 for the pay, Val.""


 ""I know, I know, but just
 the same—""


 It must have been hell for
 her. We had wandered fruitlessly
 over the red sands all
 day, both of us listening for
 the clicks of the counter. And
 the geigers had been obstinately
 hushed all day, except
 for their constant undercurrent
 of meaningless noises.


 Even though the Martian
 gravity was only a fraction of
 Earth's, I was starting to
 tire, and I knew it must have
 been really rough on Val with
 her lovely but unrugged legs.


 ""Heroes,"" she said bitterly.
 ""We're not heroes—we're
 suckers! Why did I ever let
 you volunteer for the Geig
 Corps and drag me along?""


 Which wasn't anywhere
 close to the truth. Now I
 knew she was at the breaking
 point, because Val didn't lie
 unless she was so exhausted
 she didn't know what she was
 doing. She had been just as
 much inflamed by the idea of
 coming to Mars to help in the
 search for uranium as I was.
 We knew the pay was poor,
 but we had felt it a sort of
 obligation, something we
 could do as individuals to
 keep the industries of radioactives-starved
 Earth going.
 And we'd always had a roving
 foot, both of us.


 No, we had decided together
 to come to Mars—the
 way we decided together on
 everything. Now she was
 turning against me.
I tried to jolly her. ""Buck
 up, kid,"" I said. I didn't dare
 turn up her oxy pressure any
 higher, but it was obvious she
 couldn't keep going. She was
 almost sleep-walking now.


 We pressed on over the
 barren terrain. The geiger
 kept up a fairly steady click-pattern,
 but never broke into
 that sudden explosive tumult
 that meant we had found pay-dirt.
 I started to feel tired
 myself, terribly tired. I longed
 to lie down on the soft,
 spongy Martian sand and
 bury myself.


 I looked at Val. She was
 dragging along with her eyes
 half-shut. I felt almost guilty
 for having dragged her out to
 Mars, until I recalled that I
 hadn't. In fact, she had come
 up with the idea before I did.
 I wished there was some way
 of turning the weary, bedraggled
 girl at my side back into
 the Val who had so enthusiastically
 suggested we join
 the Geigs.


 Twelve steps later, I decided
 this was about as far as
 we could go.


 I stopped, slipped out of
 the geiger harness, and lowered
 myself ponderously to
 the ground. ""What'samatter,
 Ron?"" Val asked sleepily.
 ""Something wrong?""


 ""No, baby,"" I said, putting
 out a hand and taking hers.
 ""I think we ought to rest a
 little before we go any further.
 It's been a long, hard
 day.""


 It didn't take much to persuade
 her. She slid down beside
 me, curled up, and in a
 moment she was fast asleep,
 sprawled out on the sands.
Poor kid
, I thought. Maybe
 we shouldn't have come to
 Mars after all. But, I reminded
 myself,
someone
had to do
 the job.


 A second thought appeared,
 but I squelched it:


 Why the hell me?


 I looked down at Valerie's
 sleeping form, and thought of
 our warm, comfortable little
 home on Earth. It wasn't
 much, but people in love don't
 need very fancy surroundings.


 I watched her, sleeping
 peacefully, a wayward lock of
 her soft blonde hair trailing
 down over one eyebrow, and
 it seemed hard to believe that
 we'd exchanged Earth and all
 it held for us for the raw, untamed
 struggle that was Mars.
 But I knew I'd do it again, if
 I had the chance. It's because
 we wanted to keep what we
 had. Heroes? Hell, no. We
 just liked our comforts, and
 wanted to keep them. Which
 took a little work.
Time to get moving.
But
 then Val stirred and rolled
 over in her sleep, and I didn't
 have the heart to wake her. I
 sat there, holding her, staring
 out over the desert, watching
 the wind whip the sand up
 into weird shapes.


 The Geig Corps preferred
 married couples, working in
 teams. That's what had finally
 decided it for us—we were a
 good team. We had no ties on
 Earth that couldn't be broken
 without much difficulty. So
 we volunteered.
And here we are.
Heroes.
 The wind blasted a mass of
 sand into my face, and I felt
 it tinkle against the oxymask.


 I glanced at the suit-chronometer.
 Getting late. I decided
 once again to wake Val.
 But she was tired. And I was
 tired too, tired from our
 wearying journey across the
 empty desert.


 I started to shake Val. But
 I never finished. It would be
so
nice just to lean back and
 nuzzle up to her, down in the
 sand. So nice. I yawned, and
 stretched back.
I awoke with a sudden startled
 shiver, and realized angrily
 I had let myself doze off.
 ""Come on, Val,"" I said savagely,
 and started to rise to
 my feet.


 I couldn't.


 I looked down. I was neatly
 bound in thin, tough, plastic
 tangle-cord, swathed from
 chin to boot-bottoms, my
 arms imprisoned, my feet
 caught. And tangle-cord is
 about as easy to get out of as
 a spider's web is for a trapped
 fly.


 It wasn't Martians that
 had done it. There weren't
 any Martians, hadn't been for
 a million years. It was some
 Earthman who had bound us.


 I rolled my eyes toward
 Val, and saw that she was
 similarly trussed in the sticky
 stuff. The tangle-cord was still
 fresh, giving off a faint, repugnant
 odor like that of drying
 fish. It had been spun on
 us only a short time ago, I
 realized.


 ""Ron—""


 ""Don't try to move, baby.
 This stuff can break your
 neck if you twist it wrong.""
 She continued for a moment
 to struggle futilely, and I had
 to snap, ""Lie still, Val!""


 ""A very wise statement,""
 said a brittle, harsh voice
 from above me. I looked up
 and saw a helmeted figure
 above us. He wasn't wearing
 the customary skin-tight pliable
 oxysuits we had. He
 wore an outmoded, bulky
 spacesuit and a fishbowl helmet,
 all but the face area
 opaque. The oxygen cannisters
 weren't attached to his
 back as expected, though.
 They were strapped to the
 back of the wheelchair in
 which he sat.


 Through the fishbowl I
 could see hard little eyes, a
 yellowed, parchment-like face,
 a grim-set jaw. I didn't recognize
 him, and this struck me
 odd. I thought I knew everyone
 on sparsely-settled Mars.
 Somehow I'd missed him.


 What shocked me most was
 that he had no legs. The
 spacesuit ended neatly at the
 thighs.


 He was holding in his left
 hand the tanglegun with
 which he had entrapped us,
 and a very efficient-looking
 blaster was in his right.


 ""I didn't want to disturb
 your sleep,"" he said coldly.
 ""So I've been waiting here
 for you to wake up.""


 I could just see it. He might
 have been sitting there for
 hours, complacently waiting
 to see how we'd wake up.
 That was when I realized he
 must be totally insane. I could
 feel my stomach-muscles
 tighten, my throat constrict
 painfully.


 Then anger ripped through
 me, washing away the terror.
 ""What's going on?"" I demanded,
 staring at the half
 of a man who confronted us
 from the wheelchair. ""Who
 are you?""


 ""You'll find out soon
 enough,"" he said. ""Suppose
 now you come with me."" He
 reached for the tanglegun,
 flipped the little switch on its
 side to MELT, and shot a
 stream of watery fluid over
 our legs, keeping the blaster
 trained on us all the while.
 Our legs were free.


 ""You may get up now,"" he
 said. ""Slowly, without trying
 to make trouble."" Val and I
 helped each other to our feet
 as best we could, considering
 our arms were still tightly
 bound against the sides of our
 oxysuits.


 ""Walk,"" the stranger said,
 waving the tanglegun to indicate
 the direction. ""I'll be
 right behind you."" He holstered
 the tanglegun.


 I glimpsed the bulk of an
 outboard atomic rigging behind
 him, strapped to the
 back of the wheelchair. He
 fingered a knob on the arm of
 the chair and the two exhaust
 ducts behind the wheel-housings
 flamed for a moment,
 and the chair began to roll.


 Obediently, we started
 walking. You don't argue
 with a blaster, even if the
 man pointing it is in a wheelchair.
""What's going on, Ron?""
 Val asked in a low voice as we
 walked. Behind us the wheelchair
 hissed steadily.


 ""I don't quite know, Val.
 I've never seen this guy before,
 and I thought I knew
 everyone at the Dome.""


 ""Quiet up there!"" our captor
 called, and we stopped
 talking. We trudged along together,
 with him following
 behind; I could hear the
crunch-crunch
of the wheelchair
 as its wheels chewed
 into the sand. I wondered
 where we were going, and
 why. I wondered why we had
 ever left Earth.


 The answer to that came to
 me quick enough: we had to.
 Earth needed radioactives,
 and the only way to get them
 was to get out and look. The
 great atomic wars of the late
 20th Century had used up
 much of the supply, but the
 amount used to blow up half
 the great cities of the world
 hardly compared with the
 amount we needed to put
 them back together again.


 In three centuries the shattered
 world had been completely
 rebuilt. The wreckage
 of New York and Shanghai
 and London and all the other
 ruined cities had been hidden
 by a shining new world of
 gleaming towers and flying
 roadways. We had profited by
 our grandparents' mistakes.
 They had used their atomics
 to make bombs. We used ours
 for fuel.


 It was an atomic world.
 Everything: power drills,
 printing presses, typewriters,
 can openers, ocean liners,
 powered by the inexhaustible
 energy of the dividing atom.


 But though the energy is
 inexhaustible, the supply of
 nuclei isn't. After three centuries
 of heavy consumption,
 the supply failed. The mighty
 machine that was Earth's industry
 had started to slow
 down.


 And that started the chain
 of events that led Val and me
 to end up as a madman's prisoners,
 on Mars. With every
 source of uranium mined dry
 on Earth, we had tried other
 possibilities. All sorts of
 schemes came forth. Project
 Sea-Dredge was trying to get
 uranium from the oceans. In
 forty or fifty years, they'd
 get some results, we hoped.
 But there wasn't forty or
 fifty years' worth of raw stuff
 to tide us over until then. In a
 decade or so, our power would
 be just about gone. I could
 picture the sort of dog-eat-dog
 world we'd revert back
 to. Millions of starving, freezing
 humans tooth-and-clawing
 in it in the useless shell of
 a great atomic civilization.


 So, Mars. There's not much
 uranium on Mars, and it's not
 easy to find or any cinch to
 mine. But what little is there,
 helps. It's a stopgap effort,
 just to keep things moving
 until Project Sea-Dredge
 starts functioning.


 Enter the Geig Corps: volunteers
 out on the face of
 Mars, combing for its uranium
 deposits.


 And here we are, I thought.
After we walked on a
 while, a Dome became visible
 up ahead. It slid up over the
 crest of a hill, set back between
 two hummocks on the
 desert. Just out of the way
 enough to escape observation.


 For a puzzled moment I
 thought it was our Dome, the
 settlement where all of UranCo's
 Geig Corps were located,
 but another look told me that
 this was actually quite near
 us and fairly small. A one-man
 Dome, of all things!


 ""Welcome to my home,"" he
 said. ""The name is Gregory
 Ledman."" He herded us off to
 one side of the airlock, uttered
 a few words keyed to his
 voice, and motioned us inside
 when the door slid up. When
 we were inside he reached up,
 clumsily holding the blaster,
 and unscrewed the ancient
 spacesuit fishbowl.


 His face was a bitter,
 dried-up mask. He was a man
 who hated.


 The place was spartanly
 furnished. No chairs, no tape-player,
 no decoration of any
 sort. Hard bulkhead walls,
 rivet-studded, glared back
 at us. He had an automatic
 chef, a bed, and a writing-desk,
 and no other furniture.


 Suddenly he drew the tanglegun
 and sprayed our legs
 again. We toppled heavily to
 the floor. I looked up angrily.
""I imagine you want to
 know the whole story,"" he
 said. ""The others did, too.""


 Valerie looked at me anxiously.
 Her pretty face was a
 dead white behind her oxymask.
 ""What others?""


 ""I never bothered to find
 out their names,"" Ledman
 said casually. ""They were
 other Geigs I caught unawares,
 like you, out on the
 desert. That's the only sport I
 have left—Geig-hunting. Look
 out there.""


 He gestured through the
 translucent skin of the Dome,
 and I felt sick. There was a
 little heap of bones lying
 there, looking oddly bright
 against the redness of the
 sands. They were the dried,
 parched skeletons of Earthmen.
 Bits of cloth and plastic,
 once oxymasks and suits, still
 clung to them.


 Suddenly I remembered.
 There had been a pattern
 there all the time. We didn't
 much talk about it; we chalked
 it off as occupational hazards.
 There had been a pattern
 of disappearances on the desert.
 I could think of six, eight
 names now. None of them
 had been particularly close
 friends. You don't get time to
 make close friends out here.
 But we'd vowed it wouldn't
 happen to us.


 It had.


 ""You've been hunting
 Geigs?"" I asked. ""
Why?
What've they ever done to
 you?""


 He smiled, as calmly as if
 I'd just praised his house-keeping.
 ""Because I hate
 you,"" he said blandly. ""I intend
 to wipe every last one of
 you out, one by one.""


 I stared at him. I'd never
 seen a man like this before; I
 thought all his kind had died
 at the time of the atomic
 wars.


 I heard Val sob, ""He's a
 madman!""


 ""No,"" Ledman said evenly.
 ""I'm quite sane, believe me.
 But I'm determined to drive
 the Geigs—and UranCo—off
 Mars. Eventually I'll scare
 you all away.""


 ""Just pick us off in the desert?""


 ""Exactly,"" replied Ledman.
 ""And I have no fears of an
 armed attack. This place is
 well fortified. I've devoted
 years to building it. And I'm
 back against those hills. They
 couldn't pry me out."" He let
 his pale hand run up into his
 gnarled hair. ""I've devoted
 years to this. Ever since—ever
 since I landed here on
 Mars.""
""What are you going to do
 with us?"" Val finally asked,
 after a long silence.


 He didn't smile this time.
 ""Kill you,"" he told her. ""Not
 your husband. I want him as
 an envoy, to go back and tell
 the others to clear off."" He
 rocked back and forth in his
 wheelchair, toying with the
 gleaming, deadly blaster in
 his hand.


 We stared in horror. It was
 a nightmare—sitting there,
 placidly rocking back and
 forth, a nightmare.


 I found myself fervently
 wishing I was back out there
 on the infinitely safer desert.


 ""Do I shock you?"" he asked.
 ""I shouldn't—not when
 you see my motives.""


 ""We don't see them,"" I
 snapped.


 ""Well, let me show you.
 You're on Mars hunting uranium,
 right? To mine and
 ship the radioactives back to
 Earth to keep the atomic engines
 going. Right?""


 I nodded over at our geiger
 counters.


 ""We volunteered to come to
 Mars,"" Val said irrelevantly.


 ""Ah—two young heroes,""
 Ledman said acidly. ""How
 sad. I could almost feel sorry
 for you. Almost.""


 ""Just what is it you're
 after?"" I said, stalling, stalling.


 ""Atomics cost me my legs,""
 he said. ""You remember the
 Sadlerville Blast?"" he asked.


 ""Of course."" And I did, too.
 I'd never forget it. No one
 would. How could I forget
 that great accident—killing
 hundreds, injuring thousands
 more, sterilizing forty miles
 of Mississippi land—when
 the Sadlerville pile went up?


 ""I was there on business at
 the time,"" Ledman said. ""I
 represented Ledman Atomics.
 I was there to sign a new
 contract for my company.
 You know who I am, now?""


 I nodded.


 ""I was fairly well shielded
 when it happened. I never got
 the contract, but I got a good
 dose of radiation instead. Not
 enough to kill me,"" he said.
 ""Just enough to necessitate
 the removal of—"" he indicated
 the empty space at his
 thighs. ""So I got off lightly.""
 He gestured at the wheelchair
 blanket.


 I still didn't understand.
 ""But why kill us Geigs?
We
had nothing to do with it.""


 ""You're just in this by accident,""
 he said. ""You see, after
 the explosion and the amputation,
 my fellow-members on
 the board of Ledman Atomics
 decided that a semi-basket
 case like myself was a poor
 risk as Head of the Board,
 and they took my company
 away. All quite legal, I assure
 you. They left me almost a
 pauper!"" Then he snapped
 the punchline at me.


 ""They renamed Ledman
 Atomics. Who did you say you
 worked for?""


 I began, ""Uran—""


 ""Don't bother. A more inventive
 title than Ledman
 Atomics, but not quite as
 much heart, wouldn't you
 say?"" He grinned. ""I saved
 for years; then I came to
 Mars, lost myself, built this
 Dome, and swore to get even.
 There's not a great deal of
 uranium on this planet, but
 enough to keep me in a style
 to which, unfortunately, I'm
 no longer accustomed.""
He consulted his wrist
 watch. ""Time for my injection.""
 He pulled out the tanglegun
 and sprayed us again,
 just to make doubly certain.
 ""That's another little souvenir
 of Sadlerville. I'm short
 on red blood corpuscles.""


 He rolled over to a wall
 table and fumbled in a container
 among a pile of hypodermics.
 ""There are other injections,
 too. Adrenalin, insulin.
 Others. The Blast turned
 me into a walking pin-cushion.
 But I'll pay it all
 back,"" he said. He plunged
 the needle into his arm.


 My eyes widened. It was
 too nightmarish to be real. I
 wasn't seriously worried
 about his threat to wipe out
 the entire Geig Corps, since
 it was unlikely that one man
 in a wheelchair could pick us
 all off. No, it wasn't the
 threat that disturbed me, so
 much as the whole concept, so
 strange to me, that the human
 mind could be as warped
 and twisted as Ledman's.


 I saw the horror on Val's
 face, and I knew she felt the
 same way I did.


 ""Do you really think you
 can succeed?"" I taunted him.
 ""Really think you can kill
 every Earthman on Mars? Of
 all the insane, cockeyed—""


 Val's quick, worried head-shake
 cut me off. But Ledman
 had felt my words, all right.


 ""Yes! I'll get even with
 every one of you for taking
 away my legs! If we hadn't
 meddled with the atom in the
 first place, I'd be as tall and
 powerful as you, today—instead
 of a useless cripple in a
 wheelchair.""


 ""You're sick, Gregory Ledman,""
 Val said quietly.
 ""You've conceived an impossible
 scheme of revenge and
 now you're taking it out on
 innocent people who've done
 nothing, nothing at all to you.
 That's not sane!""


 His eyes blazed. ""Who are
 you to talk of sanity?""
Uneasily I caught Val's
 glance from a corner of my
 eye. Sweat was rolling down
 her smooth forehead faster
 than the auto-wiper could
 swab it away.


 ""Why don't you do something?
 What are you waiting
 for, Ron?""


 ""Easy, baby,"" I said. I
 knew what our ace in the hole
 was. But I had to get Ledman
 within reach of me first.


 ""Enough,"" he said. ""I'm going
 to turn you loose outside,
 right after—""


 ""
Get sick!
"" I hissed to Val,
 low. She began immediately
 to cough violently, emitting
 harsh, choking sobs. ""Can't
 breathe!"" She began to yell,
 writhing in her bonds.


 That did it. Ledman hadn't
 much humanity left in him,
 but there was a little. He lowered
 the blaster a bit and
 wheeled one-hand over to see
 what was wrong with Val.
 She continued to retch and
 moan most horribly. It almost
 convinced me. I saw Val's
 pale, frightened face turn to
 me.


 He approached and peered
 down at her. He opened his
 mouth to say something, and
 at that moment I snapped my
 leg up hard, tearing the tangle-cord
 with a snicking rasp,
 and kicked his wheelchair
 over.


 The blaster went off, burning
 a hole through the Dome
 roof. The automatic sealers
 glued-in instantly. Ledman
 went sprawling helplessly out
 into the middle of the floor,
 the wheelchair upended next
 to him, its wheels slowly revolving
 in the air. The blaster
 flew from his hands at the
 impact of landing and spun
 out near me. In one quick motion
 I rolled over and covered
 it with my body.
Ledman clawed his way to
 me with tremendous effort
 and tried wildly to pry the
 blaster out from under me,
 but without success. I twisted
 a bit, reached out with my
 free leg, and booted him
 across the floor. He fetched
 up against the wall of the
 Dome and lay there.


 Val rolled over to me.


 ""Now if I could get free of
 this stuff,"" I said, ""I could get
 him covered before he comes
 to. But how?""


 ""Teamwork,"" Val said. She
 swivelled around on the floor
 until her head was near my
 boot. ""Push my oxymask off
 with your foot, if you can.""


 I searched for the clamp
 and tried to flip it. No luck,
 with my heavy, clumsy boot.
 I tried again, and this time it
 snapped open. I got the tip
 of my boot in and pried upward.
 The oxymask came off,
 slowly, scraping a jagged red
 scratch up the side of Val's
 neck as it came.


 ""There,"" she breathed.
 ""That's that.""


 I looked uneasily at Ledman.
 He was groaning and
 beginning to stir.


 Val rolled on the floor and
 her face lay near my right
 arm. I saw what she had in
 mind. She began to nibble the
 vile-tasting tangle-cord, running
 her teeth up and down
 it until it started to give. She
 continued unfailingly.


 Finally one strand snapped.
 Then another. At last I
 had enough use of my hand
 to reach out and grasp the
 blaster. Then I pulled myself
 across the floor to Ledman,
 removed the tanglegun, and
 melted the remaining tangle-cord
 off.


 My muscles were stiff and
 bunched, and rising made me
 wince. I turned and freed Val.
 Then I turned and faced Ledman.


 ""I suppose you'll kill me
 now,"" he said.


 ""No. That's the difference
 between sane people and insane,""
 I told him. ""I'm not
 going to kill you at all. I'm
 going to see to it that you're
 sent back to Earth.""


 ""
No!
"" he shouted. ""No!
 Anything but back there. I
 don't want to face them again—not
 after what they did to
 me—""


 ""Not so loud,"" I broke in.
 ""They'll help you on Earth.
 They'll take all the hatred and
 sickness out of you, and turn
 you into a useful member of
 society again.""


 ""I hate Earthmen,"" he spat
 out. ""I hate all of them.""


 ""I know,"" I said sarcastically.
 ""You're just all full of
 hate. You hated us so much
 that you couldn't bear to hang
 around on Earth for as much
 as a year after the Sadlerville
 Blast. You had to take right
 off for Mars without a moment's
 delay, didn't you? You
 hated Earth so much you
had
to leave.""


 ""Why are you telling all
 this to me?""


 ""Because if you'd stayed
 long enough, you'd have used
 some of your pension money
 to buy yourself a pair of prosthetic
 legs, and then you
 wouldn't need this wheelchair.""


 Ledman scowled, and then
 his face went belligerent
 again. ""They told me I was
 paralyzed below the waist.
 That I'd never walk again,
 even with prosthetic legs, because
 I had no muscles to fit
 them to.""


 ""You left Earth too quickly,""
 Val said.


 ""It was the only way,"" he
 protested. ""I had to get off—""


 ""She's right,"" I told him.
 ""The atom can take away, but
 it can give as well. Soon after
 you left they developed
atomic-powered
prosthetics—amazing
 things, virtually robot
 legs. All the survivors of
 the Sadlerville Blast were
 given the necessary replacement
 limbs free of charge. All
 except you. You were so sick
 you had to get away from the
 world you despised and come
 here.""


 ""You're lying,"" he said.
 ""It's not true!""


 ""Oh, but it is,"" Val smiled.


 I saw him wilt visibly, and
 for a moment I almost felt
 sorry for him, a pathetic legless
 figure propped up against
 the wall of the Dome at
 blaster-point. But then I remembered
 he'd killed twelve
 Geigs—or more—and would
 have added Val to the number
 had he had the chance.
""You're a very sick man,
 Ledman,"" I said. ""All this
 time you could have been
 happy, useful on Earth, instead
 of being holed up here
 nursing your hatred. You
 might have been useful, on
 Earth. But you decided to
 channel everything out as revenge.""


 ""I still don't believe it—those
 legs. I might have walked
 again. No—no, it's all a lie.
 They told me I'd never walk,""
 he said, weakly but stubbornly
 still.


 I could see his whole structure
 of hate starting to topple,
 and I decided to give it
 the final push.


 ""Haven't you wondered
 how I managed to break the
 tangle-cord when I kicked you
 over?""


 ""Yes—human legs aren't
 strong enough to break tangle-cord
 that way.""


 ""Of course not,"" I said. I
 gave Val the blaster and slipped
 out of my oxysuit.
 ""Look,"" I said. I pointed to
 my smooth, gleaming metal
 legs. The almost soundless
 purr of their motors was the
 only noise in the room. ""I was
 in the Sadlerville Blast, too,""
 I said. ""But I didn't go crazy
 with hate when I lost
my
legs.""


 Ledman was sobbing.


 ""Okay, Ledman,"" I said.
 Val got him into his suit, and
 brought him the fishbowl helmet.
 ""Get your helmet on and
 let's go. Between the psychs
 and the prosthetics men,
 you'll be a new man inside of
 a year.""


 ""But I'm a murderer!""


 ""That's right. And you'll be
 sentenced to psych adjustment.
 When they're finished,
 Gregory Ledman the killer
 will be as dead as if they'd
 electrocuted you, but there'll
 be a new—and sane—Gregory
 Ledman."" I turned to Val.


 ""Got the geigers, honey?""


 For the first time since
 Ledman had caught us, I remembered
 how tired Val had
 been out on the desert. I realized
 now that I had been driving
 her mercilessly—me, with
 my chromium legs and atomic-powered
 muscles. No wonder
 she was ready to fold!
 And I'd been too dense to see
 how unfair I had been.


 She lifted the geiger harnesses,
 and I put Ledman
 back in his wheelchair.


 Val slipped her oxymask
 back on and fastened it shut.


 ""Let's get back to the Dome
 in a hurry,"" I said. ""We'll
 turn Ledman over to the authorities.
 Then we can catch
 the next ship for Earth.""


 ""Go back?
Go back?
If you
 think I'm backing down now
 and quitting you can find
 yourself another wife! After
 we dump this guy I'm sacking
 in for twenty hours, and then
 we're going back out there to
 finish that search-pattern.
 Earth needs uranium, honey,
 and I know you'd never be
 happy quitting in the middle
 like that."" She smiled. ""I
 can't wait to get out there
 and start listening for those
 tell-tale clicks.""


 I gave a joyful whoop and
 swung her around. When I
 put her down, she squeezed
 my hand, hard.


 ""Let's get moving, fellow
 hero,"" she said.


 I pressed the stud for the
 airlock, smiling.

Death was Jaro Moynahan's stock in trade, and

 Mercury, he was selling his guns into the

 weirdest of all his exploits—gambling his life

 against the soft touch of a woman's lips.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Summer 1945.

On the stage of
Mercury Sam's Garden
, a tight-frocked, limber-hipped,
 red-head was singing ""
The Lady from Mars
."" The song was a rollicking,
 ribald ditty, a favorite of the planters and miners, the space pilots
 and army officers who frequented the garden. The girl rendered it with
 such gusto that the audience burst into a roar of applause.


 She bent her head in acknowledgment so that her bronze red hair fell
 down about her face. There was perspiration on her upper lip and
 temples. Her crimson mouth wore a fixed smile. Her eyes were frightened.


 The man, who had accompanied the singer on the piano, sat at the foot
 of the stage, his back to the crowded tables. He did not look up at
 the singer but kept his pale, immature face bent over the keys, while
 his fingers lightly, automatically picked out the tune. Sweat trickled
 down the back of his neck, plastered his white coat to his back.
 Without looking up, he said: ""Have you spotted him?"" His voice was
 pitched to reach the singer alone.


 The girl, with an almost imperceptible gesture, shook her head.


 The night was very hot; but then it is always hot on Mercury, the
 newest, the wildest, the hottest of Earth's frontiers. Fans spaced
 about the garden's walls sluggishly stirred the night air, while the
 men and women sitting at the tables drank heavily of Latonka, the
 pale green wine of Mercury. Only the native waiters, the enigmatic,
 yellow-eyed Mercurians, seemed unaffected by the heat. They didn't
 sweat at all.


 Up on the stage the singer was about to begin another number when she
 stiffened.


 ""Here he is,"" she said to the pianist without moving her lips.


 The pianist swung around on his stool, lifted his black eyes to the
 gate leading to the street.


 Just within the entrance, a tall, thin man was standing. He looked like
 a gaunt gray wolf loitering in the doorway. His white duraloes suit
 hung faultlessly. His black hair was close-cropped, his nose thin and
 aquiline. For a moment he studied the crowded garden before making his
 way to a vacant table.


 ""Go on,"" said the pianist in a flat voice.


 The red-head shivered. Stepping from the stage she picked her way
 through the tables until she came to the one occupied by the newcomer.


 ""May I join you?"" she asked in a low voice.


 The man arose. ""Of course. I was expecting you. Here, sit down."" He
 pulled out a chair, motioned for the waiter. The Mercurian, his yellow
 incurious eyes like two round topazes, sidled up. ""Bring us a bottle
 of Latonka from the Veederman region, well iced."" The waiter slipped
 away.


 ""So,"" said the red-head; ""you have come. I did not think you would be
 in time."" Her hands were clenched in her lap. The knuckles were white.


 The man said nothing.


 ""I did not want to call you in, Jaro Moynahan."" It was the first time
 she had used his name. ""You have the reputation of being unpredictable.
 I don't trust you, but since....""
She stopped as the waiter placed glasses on the table and deftly poured
 the pale green wine. The man, Jaro Moynahan, raised his glass.


 ""Here's to the revolution,"" he said. His low voice carried an odd,
 compelling note. His eyes, light blue and amused, were pale against his
 brown face.


 The girl drew in her breath.


 ""No! Mercury is not ready for freedom. Only a handful of fanatics are
 engineering the revolution. The real Mercurian patriots are against
 it, but they are afraid to protest. You've got to believe me. The
 revolution is scheduled to break during the Festival of the Rains. If
 it does, the Terrestrials here will be massacred. The Mercurians hate
 them. We haven't but a handful of troops.""


 Jaro Moynahan wiped the sweat from his forehead with a fine duraweb
 handkerchief. ""I had forgotten how abominably hot it can be here.""


 The girl ignored the interruption. ""There is one man; he is the leader,
 the very soul of the revolution. The Mercurians worship him. They will
 do whatever he says. Without him they would be lost. He is the rebel,
 Karfial Hodes. I am to offer you ten thousand Earth notes to kill
 Karfial Hodes.""


 Jaro Moynahan refilled their empty glasses. He was a big man, handsome
 in a gaunt fashion. Only his eyes were different. They were flat and
 a trifle oblique with straight brows. The pupils were a pale and
 penetrating blue that could probe like a surgeon's knife. Now he caught
 the girl's eyes and held them with his own as a man spears a fish.


 ""Why call me all the way from Mars for that? Why not have that gunman
 at the piano rub Hodes out?""


 The girl started, glanced at the pianist, said with a shiver: ""We can't
 locate Karfial Hodes. Don't look at me that way, Jaro. You frighten me.
 I'm telling the truth. We can't find him. That's why we called you.
 You've got to find him, Jaro. He's stirring up all Mercury.""


 ""Who's putting up the money?""


 ""I can't tell you.""


 ""Ah,"" said Jaro Moynahan; ""so that's the way it is.""


 ""That's the way it is.""


 ""There isn't much time,"" he said after a moment. ""The Rains are due any
 day now.""


 ""No,"" the girl replied. ""But we think he's here in the city.""


 ""Why? What makes you think that?""


 ""He was seen,"" she began, then stopped with a gasp.


 The lights had gone out.


 It was as unexpected as a shot in the back. One moment the garden was
 glowing in light, the next the hot black night swooped down on the
 revelers, pressing against their eyes like dark wool. The fans about
 the walls slowed audibly and stopped. It grew hotter, closer.


 Jaro Moynahan slipped sideways from the table. He felt something brush
 his sleeve. Somewhere a girl giggled.


 ""What's coming off here?"" growled a petulant male voice. Other voices
 took up the plaint.


 Across the table from Jaro there was the feel of movement; he could
 sense it. An exclamation was suddenly choked off as if a hand had been
 clamped over the girl's mouth.


 ""Red!"" said Jaro in a low voice.


 There was no answer.


 ""Red!"" he repeated, louder.


 Unexpectedly, the deep, ringing voice of Mercury Sam boomed out from
 the stage.


 ""It's all right. The master fuse blew out. The lights will be on in a
 moment.""


 On the heels of his speech the lights flashed on, driving the night
 upward. The fans recommenced their monotonous whirring.


 Jaro Moynahan glanced at the table. The red-headed singer was gone. So
 was the pianist.


 Jaro Moynahan sat quietly back down and poured himself another glass of
 Latonka. The pale green wine had a delicate yet exhilarating taste.
 It made him think of cool green grapes beaded with dew. On the hot,
 teeming planet of Mercury it was as refreshing as a cold plunge.


 He wondered who was putting up the ten thousand Earth notes? Who stood
 to lose most in case of a revolution? The answer seemed obvious enough.
 Who, but Albert Peet. Peet controlled the Latonka trade for which there
 was a tremendous demand throughout the Universe.


 And what had happened to the girl. Had the rebels abducted her. If
 so, he suspected that they had caught a tartar. The Red Witch had the
 reputation of being able to take care of herself.


 He beckoned a waiter, paid his bill. As the Mercurian started to leave,
 a thought struck Jaro. These yellow-eyed Mercurians could see as well
 in the dark as any alley-prowling cat. For centuries they had lived
 most their lives beneath ground to escape the terrible rays of the
 sun. Only at night did they emerge to work their fields and ply their
 trades. He peeled off a bill, put it in the waiter's hands.


 ""What became of the red-headed singer?""


 The Mercurian glanced at the bill, then back at the Earthman. There was
 no expression in his yellow eyes.


 ""She and the man, the queer white one who plays the piano, slipped out
 the gate to the street.""


 Jaro shrugged, dismissed the waiter. He had not expected to get much
 information from the waiter, but he was not a man to overlook any
 possibility. If the girl had been abducted, only Mercurians could have
 engineered it in the dark; and the Mercurians were a clannish lot.


 Back on the narrow alley-like street Jaro Moynahan headed for his
 hostelry. By stretching out his arms he could touch the buildings on
 either side: buildings with walls four feet thick to keep out the
 heat of the sun. Beneath his feet, he knew, stretched a labyrinth of
 rooms and passages. Somewhere in those rat-runs was Karfial Hodes, the
 revolutionist, and the girl.


 At infrequent intervals green globes cut a hole in the night, casting a
 faint illumination. He had just passed one of these futile street lamps
 when he thought he detected a footfall behind him. It was only the
 whisper of a sound, but as he passed beyond the circle of radiation, he
 flattened himself in a doorway. Nothing stirred. There was no further
 sound. Again he started forward, but now he was conscious of shadows
 following him. They were never visible, but to his trained ears there
 came stealthy, revealing noises: the brush of cloth against the baked
 earth walls, the sly shuffle of a step. He ducked down a bisecting
 alley, faded into a doorway. Immediately all sounds of pursuit stopped.
 But as soon as he emerged he was conscious again of the followers. In
 the dense, humid night, he was like a blind man trying to elude the
 cat-eyed Mercurians.
Jaro Moynahan
In the East a sullen red glow stained the heavens like the reflection
 of a fire. The Mercurian dawn was about to break. With an oath, he set
 out again for his hostelry. He made no further effort to elude the
 followers.
Once back in his room, Jaro Moynahan stripped off his clothes,
 unbuckled a shoulder holster containing a compressed air slug gun,
 stepped under the shower. His body was lean and brown as his face
 and marked with innumerable scars. There were small round puckered
 scars and long thin ones, and his left shoulder bore the unmistakable
 brownish patch of a ray burn. Stepping out of the shower, he dried,
 rebuckled on the shoulder holster, slipped into pajamas. The pajamas
 were blue with wide gaudy stripes. Next he lit a cigarette and
 stretching out on the bed began to contemplate his toes with singular
 interest.


 He had, he supposed, killed rather a lot of men. He had fought in
 the deadly little wars of the Moons of Jupiter for years, then the
 Universal Debacle of 3368, after that the Martian Revolution as well as
 dozens of skirmishes between the Federated Venusian States. No, there
 was little doubt but that he had killed quite a number of men. But this
 business of hunting a man through the rat-runs beneath the city was out
 of his line.


 Furthermore, there was something phony about the entire set up.
 The Mercurians, he knew, had been agitating for freedom for years.
 Why, at this time when the Earth Congress was about to grant them
 self-government, should they stage a revolution?


 A loud, authoritative rapping at the door interrupted further
 speculation. He swung his bare feet over the edge of the bed, stood
 up and ground out his cigarette. Before he could reach the door the
 rapping came again.


 Throwing off the latch, he stepped back, balancing on the balls of his
 feet.


 ""Come in,"" he called.


 The door swung open. A heavy set man entered, shut and locked the door,
 then glanced around casually. His eyes fastened on Jaro. He licked his
 lips.


 ""Mr. Moynahan, the—ah—professional soldier, I believe."" His voice was
 high, almost feminine. ""I'm Albert Peet."" He held out a fat pink hand.


 Jaro said nothing. He ignored the hand, waited, poised like a cat.


 Mr. Peet licked his lips again. ""I have come, Mr. Moynahan, on a matter
 of business, urgent business. I had not intended to appear in this
 matter. I preferred to remain behind the scenes, but the disappearance
 of Miss Mikail has—ah—forced my hand."" He paused.


 Jaro still said nothing. Miss Mikail must be the red-headed singer,
 whom at different times he had known under a dozen different aliases.
 He doubted that even she remembered her right name.


 ""Miss Mikail made you a proposition?"" Albert Peet's voice was tight.


 ""Yes,"" said Jaro.


 ""You accepted?""


 ""Why, no. As it happened she was abducted before I had the chance.""


 Mr. Peet licked his lips. ""But you will, surely you will. Unless
 Karfial Hodes is stopped immediately there will be a bloody uprising
 all over the planet during the Festival of the Rains. Earth doesn't
 realize the seriousness of the situation.""


 ""Then I was right; it is you who are putting up the ten thousand Earth
 notes.""


 ""Not entirely,"" said Peet uncomfortably. ""There are many of us
 here, Mercurians as well as Earthmen, who recognize the danger. We
 have—ah—pooled our resources.""


 ""But you stand to lose most in case of a successful revolution?""


 ""Perhaps. I have a large interest in the Latonka trade. It
 is—ah—lucrative.""
Jaro Moynahan lit a cigarette, sat down on the edge of the bed. ""Why
 beat about the bush,"" he asked with a sudden grin. ""Mr. Peet, you've
 gained control of the Latonka trade. Other Earthmen are in control
 of the mines and the northern plantations. Together you form perhaps
 the strongest combine the Universe has ever seen. You actually run
 Mercury, and you've squeezed out every possible penny. Every time
 self-government has come before the Earth Congress you've succeeded in
 blocking it. You are, perhaps, the most cordially-hated group anywhere.
 I don't wonder that you are afraid of a revolution.""


 Mr. Peet took out a handkerchief and mopped his forehead. ""Fifteen
 thousand Earth notes I can offer you. But no more. That is as high as I
 can go.""


 Jaro laughed. ""How did you know Red had been kidnapped?""


 ""We have a very efficient information system. I had the report of Miss
 Mikail's abduction fifteen minutes after the fact.""


 Jaro raised his eyebrows. ""Perhaps then you know where she is?""


 Mr. Peet shook his head. ""No. Karfial Hodes' men abducted her.""


 A second rapping at the door caused them to exchange glances. Jaro went
 to the door, opened it. The pianist at the gardens was framed in the
 entrance. His black eyes burned holes in his pale boyish face. His
 white suit was blotched with sweat and dirt.


 ""They told me Mr. Peet was here,"" he said.


 ""It's for you,"" said Jaro over his shoulder.


 Mr. Peet came to the door. ""Hello, Stanley. I thought Hodes had you?
 Where's Miss Mikail?""


 ""I got away. Look, Mr. Peet, I got to see you alone.""


 Albert Peet said, ""Would you excuse me, Mr. Moynahan?"" He licked his
 lips. ""I'll just step out into the hall a moment."" He went out, drawing
 the door shut after him.


 Jaro lit a cigarette. He padded nervously back and forth across the
 room, his bare feet making no noise. He sat down on the edge of the
 bed. He got up and ground out the cigarette. He went to the door, but
 did not open it. Instead, he took another turn about the room. Again he
 came to a halt before the door, pressed his ear against the panel. For
 a long time he listened but could distinguish no murmur of voices. With
 an oath he threw open the door. The hall was empty.
II


 Jaro returned to his room, stripped off his pajamas, climbed back into
 his suit. He tested the slug gun. It was a flat, ugly weapon which
 hurled a slug the size of a quarter. He preferred it because, though he
 seldom shot to kill, it stopped a man like a well placed mule's hoof.
 He adjusted the gun lightly in its holster in order that it wouldn't
 stick if he were called upon to use it in a hurry. Then he went out
 into the hall.


 At the desk he inquired if any messages had come for him. There were
 none, but the clerk had seen Mr. Peet with a young fellow take the
 incline to the underground. Above the clerk's head a newsograph was
 reeling off the current events almost as soon as they happened. Jaro
 read:


 ""
Earth Congress suspends negotiations on Mercurian freedom pending
 investigation of rumored rebellion. Terrestrials advised to return to
 Earth. Karfial Hodes, Mercurian patriot, being sought.
""


 Jaro descended the incline to the network of burrows which served
 as streets during the flaming days. Here in the basements and
 sub-basements were located the shops and dram houses where the
 Mercurians sat around little tables drinking silently of the pale green
 Latonka. The burrows were but poorly lit, the natives preferring the
 cool gloom, and Jaro had to feel his way, rubbing shoulders with the
 strange, silent populace. But when he reached the Terrestrial quarter
 of the city, bright radoxide lights took the place of the green globes,
 and there was a sprinkling of Colonial guards among the throng.


 Jaro halted before a door bearing a placard which read:


 ""LATONKA TRUST""


 He pushed through the door into a rich carpeted reception room. At the
 far end was a second door beside which sat a desk, door and desk being
 railed off from the rest of the office. The door into Albert Peet's
 inner sanctum was ajar. Jaro could distinguish voices; then quite
 clearly he heard Albert Peet say in a high girlish tone:


 ""Stanley, I thought I left you in the native quarter. Why did you
 follow me? How many times have I told you never to come here?""


 The reply was unintelligible. Then the pale-faced young man came
 through the door shutting it after himself. At the sight of Jaro
 Moynahan he froze.


 ""What're you sneaking around here for?""


 Jaro settled himself warily, his light blue eyes flicking over the
 youth.


 ""Let's get this straight,"" he said mildly. ""I've known your kind
 before. Frankly, ever since I saw you I've had to repress a desire to
 step on you as I might a spider.""


 The youth's black eyes were hot as coals, his fingers twitching. His
 hands began to creep upward.


 ""You dirty ..."" he began, but he got no further. Jaro Moynahan shot him
 in the shoulder.


 The compressed air slug gun had seemed to leap into Jaro's hand. The
 big slug, smacked the gunman's shoulder with a resounding thwack,
 hurled him against the wall. Jaro vaulted the rail, deftly relieved him
 of two poisoned needle guns.


 ""I'll get you for this,"" said Stanley, his mouth twisted in pain.
 ""You've broken my shoulder. I'll kill you.""


 The door to the inner sanctum swung open.


 ""What's happened?"" cried Albert Peet in distress. ""What's wrong with
 you, Stanley?""


 ""This dirty slob shot me in the shoulder.""


 ""But how badly?"" Peet was wringing his hands.


 ""Nothing serious,"" said Jaro. ""He'll have his arm in a sling for a
 while. That's all.""


 ""Stanley,"" said Mr. Peet. ""You're bleeding all over my carpet. Why
 can't you go in the washroom. There's a tile floor in there. If you
 hadn't disobeyed this wouldn't have happened. You and your fights. Has
 anyone called a doctor? Where's Miss Webb? Miss Webb! Oh, Miss Webb!
 That girl. Miss Webb!""
Stanley climbed to his feet, swayed a moment drunkenly, then wobbled
 out a door on the left just as a tall brunette hurried in from the
 right. She had straight black hair which hung not quite to her
 shoulders, and dark brown eyes, and enough of everything else to absorb
 Jaro's attention.


 ""Oh!"" exclaimed Miss Webb as she caught sight of the blood staining the
 carpet.
Joan Webb
""There's been an—ah—accident,"" said Mr. Peet, and he licked his lips.
 ""Call a doctor, Miss Webb.""


 Miss Webb raised an eyebrow, went to the visoscreen. In a moment she
 had tuned in the prim starched figure of a nurse seated at a desk.


 ""Could Dr. Baer rush right over here? There's been an accident.""


 ""Rush over where?"" said the girl in the visoscreen. ""These gadgets
 aren't telepathic, honey.""


 ""Oh,"" said Miss Webb, ""the offices of the Latonka Trust.""


 The girl in the visoscreen thawed like ice cream in the sun. ""I'm sure
 Dr. Baer can come. He'll be there in a moment.""


 ""Thank you,"" said Miss Webb. She flicked the machine off, then added:
 ""You trollop.""


 Mr. Peet regarded Jaro Moynahan with distress.


 ""Really, Mr. Moynahan, was it necessary to shoot Stanley? Isn't
 that—ah—a little extreme? I'm afraid it might incapacitate him, and I
 had a job for him.""


 ""Oh,"" cried Miss Webb, her brown eyes crackling. ""Did you shoot that
 poor boy? Aren't you the big brave man?""


 ""Poor boy?"" said Jaro mildly. ""Venomous little rattlesnake. I took
 these toys away from him."" He held out the poisoned dart guns. ""You
 take them, Mr. Peet. Frankly, they give me the creeps. They might go
 off. A scratch from one of those needles would be enough.""


 Mr. Peet accepted the guns gingerly. He held them as if they might
 explode any minute. He started to put them in his pocket, thought
 better of it, glanced around helplessly.


 ""Here, Miss Webb,"" he said, ""do something with these. Put them in my
 desk.""


 Miss Webb's eyes grew round as marbles. ""I wouldn't touch one of those
 nasty little contraptions for all the Latonka on Mercury.""


 ""Here, I'll take them,"" said Stanley coming back into the room. He had
 staunched the flow of blood. His face was even whiter, if possible.
 Jaro eyed him coldly as with his good hand the youth dropped the dart
 guns back into their holsters.


 ""Act like you want to use those and I'll put a slug in your head next
 time.""


 ""Now, Mr. Moynahan."" Mr. Peet licked his lips nervously. ""Stanley, go
 into my office. The doctor will be here in a moment. Miss Webb, you may
 go home. I'll have no more work for you today.""
Albert Peet led Stanley through the door. Jaro and Miss Webb were
 alone. With his eye on the door, Jaro said:


 ""When you go out, turn left toward the native quarter. Wait for me in
 the first grog shop you come to.""


 Miss Webb raised her eyebrows. ""What's this? A new technique?""


 ""Look,"" began Jaro annoyed.


 ""My eyes are practically popping out of my head now,"" she interrupted.
 ""Another morning like this and I take the first space liner back to
 Earth."" She jammed her hat on backward, snatched her bag from the desk
 drawer.


 ""I'm not trying to pick you up. This is....""


 ""How disappointing.""


 Jaro began again patiently. ""Wait for me in the first grog shop.
 There's something I must know. It's important."" He cleared his throat.
 ""Don't you find the heat rather uncomfortable, Miss Webb. But perhaps
 you've become accustomed to it.""


 Mr. Peet came back into the room.


 ""Why, no, I mean yes,"" replied Miss Webb, a blank expression in her
 eyes.


 ""Goodbye, Miss Webb,"" said Mr. Peet firmly.


 Jaro grinned and winked at her. Miss Webb tottered out of the room.


 As the door closed behind the girl, Albert Peet licked his lips, said:
 ""Mr. Moynahan, I suppose my disappearance back at your room requires
 some explanation. But the fact is that Stanley brought an important bit
 of news."" He paused.


 Jaro said nothing.


 ""You might be interested to know that Miss Mikail is quite safe.
 Karfial Hodes has her, but Stanley assures me she will be quite safe.""
 Again he paused. As Jaro remained silent, his neck mottled up pinkly.


 ""The fact is, Mr. Moynahan, that we won't need you after all. I realize
 that we've put you to considerable trouble and we're prepared to pay
 you whatever you believe your time is worth. Say five hundred Earth
 notes?""


 ""That's fair enough,"" replied Jaro.


 Albert Peet sighed. ""I have the check made out.""


 ""Only,"" continued Jaro coldly, ""I'm not ready to be bought off. I think
 I'll deal myself a hand in this game.""


 Mr. Peet's face fell. ""You won't reconsider?""


 ""Sorry,"" said Jaro; ""but I've got a date. I'm late now."" He started to
 leave.


 ""Stanley!"" called Albert Peet.


 The pale-faced young man appeared in the doorway, the dart gun in his
 good hand. Jaro Moynahan dropped on his face, jerking out his slug gun
 as he fell. There was a tiny plop like a cap exploding. He heard the
 whisper of the poisoned dart as it passed overhead. Then he fired from
 the floor. The pale-faced young man crumpled like an empty sack.


 Jaro got up, keeping an eye on Albert Peet, brushed off his knees.


 ""You've killed him,"" said Peet. ""If I were you, Mr. Moynahan, I would
 be on the next liner back to Earth.""


 Without answering, Jaro backed watchfully from the room.
Once Jaro Moynahan had regained the street, he mopped his forehead with
 his handkerchief. Whatever was going on, these boys played for keeps.
 Warily he started down the passage toward the native quarter. At the
 first basement grog shop he turned in. His eyes swept the chamber, then
 he grinned.


 At a corner table, a tall glass of Latonka before her, sat Miss Webb.
 Her hat was still on backwards, and she was perched on the edge of her
 chair as if ready to spring up and away like a startled faun.


 ""
Bang!
"" said Jaro coming up behind her and poking a long brown finger
 in the small of her back.


 Miss Webb uttered a shriek, jerked so violently that her hat tilted
 over one eye. She regarded him balefully from beneath the brim.


 ""Never a dull moment,"" she gritted.


 Still grinning, Jaro sat down. ""I'm Jaro Moynahan, Miss Webb. I think
 Albert Peet forgot to introduce us. There's some skullduggery going on
 here that I'm particularly anxious to get to the bottom of. I thought
 you might be able to help me.""


 ""Yes,"" replied Miss Webb sweetly.


 A native waiter, attracted no doubt by her scream, came over and took
 Jaro's order.


 ""All right,"" Jaro smiled, but his pale blue eyes probed the girl
 thoughtfully. ""I'll have to confide certain facts which might be
 dangerous for you to know. Are you game, Miss Webb?""


 ""Since we're going to be so chummy,"" she replied; ""you might begin by
 calling me Joan. You make me feel downright ancient.""


 ""Well then,"" he said. ""In the first place, I just killed that
 baby-faced gunman your boss had in his office.""


 ""
Awk!
"" said Joan, choking on the Latonka.


 ""It was self-defense,"" he hastened to assure her. ""He took a pot shot
 at me with that poisoned dart gun.""


 ""But the police!"" she cried, as she caught her breath.


 ""There'll never be an investigation. Albert Peet will see to that. I
 was called here on what I supposed was a legitimate revolution. Instead
 I was offered ten thousand Earth notes to assassinate the leader of the
 revolution.""


 ""What revolution? I'm going around in circles.""


 ""The Mercurians, of course.""


 ""I don't believe it,"" said the girl. ""The Mercurians are the most
 peaceable people in the Universe. They've been agitating for freedom,
 yes. But they believe in passive resistance. I don't believe you could
 induce a Mercurian to kill, even in self-protection. That's why Albert
 Peet and the rest of the combine had such an easy time gaining control
 of the Latonka trade.""


 ""Score one,"" breathed Jaro, ""I begin to see light. Miss Webb—ah,
 Joan—I've a notion that we're going to be a great team. How do you
 happen to be Albert Peet's private secretary?""


 ""A gal's gotta eat. But the truth is, I was quitting. The Latonka Trust
 is almost on the rocks. Their stock has been dropping like a meteor.""


 Jaro Moynahan raised his oblique brows but did not interrupt.


 ""Albert Peet,"" she continued, ""has been trying to sell out but nobody
 will touch the stock, not since it looks as if the Earth Congress is
 going to grant the Mercurians their freedom. Everybody knows that the
 first thing the Mercurians will do, will be to boot out the Latonka
 Trust.""


 ""What about this Karfial Hodes?"" said Jaro. ""I've heard that he's
 inciting the Mercurians to rebellion. The newscaster had a line about
 the revolution too. The government has advised all Terrestrials to
 return to Earth.""


 ""It's not true,"" Joan flared. ""It's all a pack of lies invented by the
 Latonka Trust. I know.""


 ""But I should think rumors like that would run down the Latonka stock.""

Gutenberg,"QUEST OF THIG
By BASIL WELLS
Thig of Ortha was the vanguard of the conquering

 ""HORDE."" He had blasted across trackless space

 to subdue a defenseless world—only to meet on

 Earth emotions that were more deadly than weapons.


 [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from

 Planet Stories Fall 1942.

 Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that

Thig carefully smoothed the dark sand and seaweed of the lonely beach
 over the metal lid of the flexible ringed tunnel that linked the grubby
 ship from another planet with the upper air. He looked out across the
 heaving waters of the Sound toward Connecticut. He stared appraisingly
 around at the luxuriant green growth of foliage further inland; and
 started toward the little stretch of trees and brush, walking carefully
 because of the lesser gravitation.


 Thig was shorter than the average Earthman—although on Ortha he
 was well above the average in height—but his body was thick and
 powerfully muscled. His skull was well-shaped and large; his features
 were regular, perhaps a trifle oversize, and his hair and eyes were
 a curiously matching blend of reddish brown. Oddest of all, he wore
 no garments, other than the necessary belt and straps to support his
 rod-like weapon of white metal and his pouches for food and specimens.


 The Orthan entered the narrow strip of trees and crossed to the
 little-used highway on the other side. Here he patiently sat down to
 wait for an Earthman or an Earthwoman to pass. His task now was to
 bring a native, intact if possible, back to the carefully buried space
 cruiser where his two fellows and himself would drain the creature's
 mentality of all its knowledge. In this way they could learn whether a
 planet was suited for colonization by later swarms of Orthans.


 Already they had charted over a hundred celestial bodies but of them
 all only three had proven worthy of consideration. This latest planet,
 however, 72-P-3 on the chart, appeared to be an ideal world in every
 respect. Sunlight, plenty of water and a dense atmospheric envelope
 made of 72-P-3 a paradise among planets.


 The explorer from another world crouched into the concealment of a
 leafy shrub. A creature was approaching. Its squat body was covered
 with baggy strips of bluish cloth and it carried a jointed rod of metal
 and wood in its paw. It walked upright as did the men of Ortha.


 Thig's cold eyes opened a trifle wider as he stared into the thing's
 stupid face. It was as though he was looking into a bit of polished
 metal at the reflection of himself!


 The Earthman was opposite now and he must waste no more precious
 time. The mighty muscles of the Orthan sent him hurtling across the
 intervening space in two prodigious bounds, and his hands clamped
 across the mouth and neck of the stranger....
Lewis Terry was going fishing. For a week the typewriter mill that had
 ground out a thousand assorted yarns of the untamed West and the frigid
 desolation of the Northwoods had been silent. Lewis wondered if he was
 going stale. He had sat every day for eight hours in front of that
 shiny-buttoned bane of the typist, but there were no results. Feebly
 he had punched a key two days ago and a $ sign had appeared. He hadn't
 dared touch the machine since.


 For Mr. Terry, that hard-hitting writer of two-gun action, had never
 been further west of Long Island than Elizabeth, and he had promised
 his wife, Ellen, that he would take the three children and herself on
 a trailer tour of the
West
that very summer. Since that promise, he
 could not write a word. Visions of whooping red-skinned Apaches and
 be-chapped outlaws raiding his little trailer home kept rolling up out
 of his subconscious. Yet he
had
to write at least three novelets and
 a fistful of short stories in the next two weeks to finance the great
 adventure—or the trip was off.


 So Lewis left the weathered old cottage in the early dawn and headed
 for his tubby old boat at the landing in an attempt to work out a
 salable yarn....


 ""Hey!"" he shouted as a naked man sprang out of the bushes beside the
 road. ""What's the trouble?""


 Then he had no time for further speech, the massive arms of the
 stranger had wound around him and two hamlike hands shut off his speech
 and his wind. He fought futilely against trained muscles. The hand
 clamping his throat relaxed for a moment and hacked along the side of
 his head. Blackness flooded the brain of Lewis, and he knew no more.
""There it is,"" announced Thig, dropping the limp body of the captured
 Earthman to the metal deck-plates. ""It is a male of the species that
 must have built the cities we saw as we landed.""


 ""He resembles Thig,"" announced Kam. ""But for the strange covering he
 wears he might be Thig.""


 ""Thig will be this creature!"" announced Torp. ""With a psychic relay we
 will transfer the Earthman's memories and meager store of knowledge to
 the brain of Thig! He can then go out and scout this world without
 arousing suspicion. While he is gone, I will take Kam and explore the
 two inner planets.""


 ""You are the commander,"" said Thig. ""But I wish this beast did not wear
 these clumsy sheathing upon his body. On Ortha we do not hamper the use
 of our limbs so.""


 ""Do not question the word of your commander,"" growled Torp, swelling
 out his thick chest menacingly. ""It is for the good of our people that
 you disguise yourself as an Earthman.""


 ""For the good of the Horde,"" Thig intoned almost piously as he lifted
 Terry's body and headed for the laboratory.


 Service for the Horde was all that the men of Ortha knew. Carefully
 cultured and brought to life in the laboratories of their Horde, they
 knew neither father nor mother. Affection and love were entirely
 lacking in their early training and later life. They were trained
 antlike from childhood that only the growth and power of the Horde
 were of any moment. Men and women alike toiled and died like unfeeling
 robots of flesh and bone for the Horde. The Horde was their religion,
 their love-life, their everything!


 So it was that the bodies of the Earthman and the Orthan were strapped
 on two parallel tables of chill metal and the twin helmets, linked to
 one another by the intricacies of the psychic relay, put upon their
 heads.


 For ten hours or more the droning hum of the relay sucked Terry's brain
 dry of knowledge. The shock upon the nervous system of the Earthman
 proved too violent and his heart faltered after a time and stopped
 completely. Twice, with subtle drugs they restored pseudo-life to his
 body and kept the electrical impulses throbbing from his tortured
 brain, but after the third suspension of life Thig removed his helmet.


 ""There is nothing more to learn,"" he informed his impassive comrades.
 ""Now, let us get on with the plastic surgery that is required. My new
 body must return to its barbaric household before undue attention is
 aroused. And when I return I will take along some of the gleaming
 baubles we found on the red planet—these people value them highly.""


 An hour later, his scars and altered cartilage already healed and
 painless, Thig again scraped sand over the entrance to the space ship
 and set out along the moonlit beach toward the nearest path running
 inland to his home.


 Memory was laying the country bare about him, Terry's own childhood
 memories of this particular section of Long Island. Here was the place
 where Jake and Ted had helped him dig for the buried treasure that
 old 'Notch-ear' Beggs had told them so exactly about. Remembrance of
 that episode gave Thig an idea about the little lump of jewels in his
 pocket. He had found them in a chest along the beach!


 He was coming up on the porch now and at the sound of his foot on
 the sagging boards the screen door burst open and three little
 Earth-creatures were hugging at his legs. An odd sensation, that his
 acquired memories labeled as pleasure, sent a warm glow upward from
 around his heart.


 Then he saw the slender red-haired shape of a woman, the mate of the
 dead man he knew, and confusion struck his well-trained brain. Men
 had no mates on Ortha, sex had been overthrown with all the other
 primitive impulses of barbarism; so he was incapable of understanding
 the emotions that swept through his acquired memory.


 Unsteadily he took her in his arms and felt her warm lips pressed,
 trembling, against his own. That same hot wave of pulsing blood choked
 achingly up into his throat.


 ""Lew, dear,"" Ellen was asking, ""where have you been all day? I called
 up at the landing but you were not there. I wanted to let you know that
 Saddlebag Publications sent a check for $50 for ""Reversed Revolvers""
 and three other editors asked for shorts soon.""
""Shoulda got a hundred bucks for that yarn,"" grunted Thig, and gasped.


 For the moment he had been Lewis Terry and not Thig! So thoroughly had
 he acquired the knowledge of Terry that he found himself unconsciously
 adopting the thinking and mannerism of the other. All the better this
 way, he realized—more natural.


 ""Sorry I was late,"" he said, digging into his pocket for the
 glittering baubles, ""but I was poking around on the beach where we used
 to hunt treasure and I found an old chest. Inside it I found nothing
 but a handful of these.""


 He flashed the jewels in front of Ellen's startled eyes and she clung,
 unbelieving, to his arm.


 ""Why, Lew,"" she gasped, ""they're worth a fortune! We can buy that new
 trailer now and have a rebuilt motor in the car. We can go west right
 away.... Hollywood, the Grand Canyon, cowboys!""


 ""Uh huh,"" agreed the pseudo Lewis, memories of the ferocious savages
 and gunmen of his stories rendering him acutely unhappy. Sincerely he
 hoped that the west had reformed.


 ""I saved some kraut and weiners,"" Ellen said. ""Get washed up while I'm
 warming them up. Kids ate all the bread so I had to borrow some from
 the Eskoes. Want coffee, too?""


 ""Mmmmmm,"" came from the depths of the chipped white wash-basin.
""Home again,"" whispered Ellen as she stood beside Thig twelve weeks
 later and gazed tearfully at the weathered little gray house. She knelt
 beside the front stoop and reached for the key hidden beneath it.


 ""The west was wonderful; tremendous, vast and beautiful,"" she went
 on as they climbed the steps, ""but nowhere was there any place as
 beautiful as our own little strip of sky and water.""


 Thig sank into a dusty old swing that hung on creaking chains from the
 exposed rafters of the porch roof. He looked down at the dusty gray car
 and the bulbous silvery bulk of the trailer that had been their living
 quarters for almost three months. Strange thoughts were afloat in the
 chaos of his cool Orthan brain.


 Tonight or tomorrow night at the latest he must contact his two fellows
 and report that Earth was a planetary paradise. No other world,
 including Ortha, was so well-favored and rich. An expeditionary force
 to wipe the grotesque civilizations of Earth out of existence would,
 of course, be necessary before the first units of new Hordes could be
 landed. And there Thig balked. Why must they destroy these people,
 imperfect though their civilization might be, to make room for the
 Hordes?


 Thig tried to tell himself that it was the transmitted thoughts of the
 dead Earthman that made him feel so, but he was not too sure. For three
 months he had lived with people who loved, hated, wept and sacrificed
 for reasons that he had never known existed. He had learned the heady
 glory of thinking for himself and making his own decisions. He had
 experienced the primitive joy of matching his wits and tongue against
 the wits of other unpredictable human beings. There was no abrupt
 division of men and women into definite classes of endeavor. A laborer
 thought the same thoughts that a governor might think. Uncertainty
 added zest to every day's life.


 The Orthan had come to question the sole devotion of the individual to
 the Horde to the exclusion of all other interests. What, he wondered,
 would one new world—or a hundred—populated by the Hordes add to
 the progress of humanity? For a hundred thousand years the Orthan
 civilization had remained static, its energies directed into certain
 well-defined channels. They were mindless bees maintaining their vast
 mechanical hives.


 There was that moment on the brink of the Grand Canyon when Ellen had
 caught his arm breathlessly at all the beauty spread away there beneath
 them. There were mornings in the desert when the sun painted in lurid
 red the peaks above the harsh black-and-whites of the sagebrush and
 cactus slopes. There was the little boy, his body burning with fever,
 who nestled trustingly against his tense man's body and slept—the son
 of Ellen and the man he had destroyed.


 Thig groaned. He was a weakling to let sentimentality so get the better
 of his judgment. He would go now to the space ship and urge them to
 blast off for Ortha. He sprang off the porch and strode away down the
 road toward the beach.


 The children ran to him; wanted to go along. He sent them away harshly
 but they smiled and waved their brown little hands. Ellen came to the
 door and called after him.


 ""Hurry home, dear,"" she said. ""I'll have a bite ready in about an hour.""


 He dared not say anything, for his voice would have broken and she
 would have known something was wrong. She was a very wise sort of
 person when something was troubling him. He waved his stubby paw of a
 hand to show that he had heard, and blindly hurried toward the Sound.


 Oddly enough, as he hurried away along the narrow path through the
 autumn woods, his mind busied itself with a new epic of the west that
 lived no longer. He mentally titled it: ""Rustlers' Riot"" and blocked
 in the outlines of his plot. One section of his brain was that of the
 careless author of gunslinging yarns, a section that seemed to be
 sapping the life from his own brain. He knew that the story would never
 be written, but he toyed with the idea.


 So far had Thig the emotionless, robot-being from Ortha drifted from
 the unquestioning worship of the Horde!
""You have done well,"" announced Torp when Thig had completed his report
 on the resources and temperatures of various sections of Terra. ""We now
 have located three worlds fit for colonization and so we will return to
 Ortha at once.


 ""I will recommend the conquest of this planet, 72-P-3 at once and the
 complete destruction of all biped life upon it. The mental aberrations
 of the barbaric natives might lead to endless complications if they
 were permitted to exist outside our ordered way of life. I imagine that
 three circuits of the planet about its primary should prove sufficient
 for the purposes of complete liquidation.""


 ""But why,"" asked Thig slowly, ""could we not disarm all the natives and
 exile them on one of the less desirable continents, Antarctica for
 example or Siberia? They are primitive humans even as our race was once
 a race of primitives. It is not our duty to help to attain our own
 degree of knowledge and comfort?""


 ""Only the good of the Horde matters!"" shouted Torp angrily. ""Shall a
 race of feeble-witted beasts, such as these Earthmen, stand in the way
 of a superior race? We want their world, and so we will take it. The
 Law of the Horde states that all the universe is ours for the taking.""


 ""Let us get back to Ortha at once, then,"" gritted out Thig savagely.
 ""Never again do I wish to set foot upon the soil of this mad planet.
 There are forces at work upon Earth that we of Ortha have long
 forgotten.""


 ""Check the blood of Thig for disease, Kam,"" ordered Torp shortly. ""His
 words are highly irrational. Some form of fever perhaps native to this
 world. While you examine him I will blast off for Ortha.""


 Thig followed Kam into the tiny laboratory and found a seat beside the
 squat scientist's desk. His eyes roamed over the familiar instruments
 and gauges, each in its own precise position in the cases along the
 walls. His gaze lingered longest on the stubby black ugliness of
 a decomposition blaster in its rack close to the deck. A blast of
 the invisible radiations from that weapon's hot throat and flesh or
 vegetable fiber rotted into flaky ashes.


 The ship trembled beneath their feet; it tore free from the feeble
 clutch of the sand about it, and they were rocketing skyward. Thig's
 broad fingers bit deep into the unyielding metal of his chair. Suddenly
 he knew that he must go back to Earth, back to Ellen and the children
 of the man he had helped destroy. He loved Ellen, and nothing must
 stand between them! The Hordes of Ortha must find some other world, an
 empty world—this planet was not for them.


 ""Turn back!"" he cried wildly. ""I must go back to Earth. There is a
 woman there, helpless and alone, who needs me! The Horde does not need
 this planet.""


 Kam eyed him coldly and lifted a shining hypodermic syringe from its
 case. He approached Thig warily, aware that disease often made a maniac
 of the finest members of the Horde.


 ""No human being is more important than the Horde,"" he stated baldly.
 ""This woman of whom you speak is merely one unit of the millions we
 must eliminate for the good of the Horde.""


 Then it was that Thig went berserk. His fists slashed into the thick
 jaw of the scientist and his fingers ripped at the hard cords overlying
 the Orthan's vital throat tubes. His fingers and thumb gouged deep into
 Kam's startled throat and choked off any cry for assistance before it
 could be uttered.


 Kam's hand swept down to the holster swung from his intricate harness
 and dragged his blaster from it. Thig's other hand clamped over his and
 for long moments they swayed there, locked together in silent deadly
 struggle. The fate of a world hung in the balance as Kam's other hand
 fought against that lone arm of Thig.
The scales swung in favor of Kam. Slowly the flaring snout of his
 weapon tilted upward until it reached the level of Thig's waist. Thig
 suddenly released his grip and dragged his enemy toward him. A sudden
 reversal of pressure on Kam's gun hand sent the weapon swivelling
 about full upon its owner's thick torso. Thig's fingers pressed down
 upon Kam's button finger, down upon the stud set into the grip of the
 decomposition blaster, and Kam's muscles turned to water. He shrieked.


 Before Thig's eyes half of his comrade's body sloughed away into foul
 corruption that swiftly gave way to hardened blobs of dessicated
 matter. Horror for what he had done—that he had slain one of his own
 Horde—made his limbs move woodenly. All of his thoughts were dulled
 for the moment. Painfully slow, he turned his body around toward the
 control blister, turned around on leaden feet, to look full into the
 narrowed icy eyes of his commander.


 He saw the heavy barrel of the blaster slashing down against his
 skull but he could not swing a fraction of an inch out of the way.
 His body seemed paralyzed. This was the end, he thought as he waited
 stupidly for the blow to fall, the end for Ellen and the kids and all
 the struggling races of Earth. He would never write another cowboy
 yarn—they would all be dead anyhow soon.


 Then a thunderclap exploded against his head and he dropped endlessly
 toward the deck. Blows rained against his skull. He wondered if Torp
 would ever cease to hammer at him and turn the deadly ray of the weapon
 upon him. Blood throbbed and pounded with every blow....
Bam, Bam, Bam, the blood pounded in his ears. Like repeated blows of a
 hammer they shook his booming head. No longer was Torp above him. He
 was in the corner of the laboratory, a crumpled blood-smeared heap of
 bruised flesh and bone. He was unfettered and the blood was caked upon
 his skull and in his matted hair. Torp must have thought he had killed
 him with those savage blows upon the head.


 Even Torp, thought Thig ruefully, gave way to the primitive rage of his
 ancestors at times; but to that very bit of unconscious atavism he now
 owed his life. A cool-headed robot of an Orthan would have efficiently
 used the blaster to destroy any possibility of remaining life in his
 unconscious body.


 Thig rolled slowly over so that his eye found the door into the control
 room. Torp would be coming back again to dispose of their bodies
 through the refuse lock. Already the body of Kam was gone. He wondered
 why he had been left until last. Perhaps Torp wished to take cultures
 of his blood and tissues to determine whether a disease was responsible
 for his sudden madness.


 The cases of fragile instruments were just above his head. Association
 of memories brought him the flash of the heavy blaster in its rack
 beneath them. His hand went up and felt the welcome hardness of the
 weapon. He tugged it free.


 In a moment he was on his knees crawling across the plates of the deck
 toward the door. Halfway across the floor he collapsed on his face,
 the metal of the gun making a harsh clang. He heard the feet of Torp
 scuffle out of silence and a choked cry in the man's throat squalled
 out into a senseless whinny.


 Thig raised himself up on a quivering elbow and slid the black length
 of the blaster in front of him. His eyes sought the doorway and stared
 full into the glaring vacant orbs of his commander. Torp leaned there
 watching him, his breath gurgling brokenly through his deep-bitten
 lips. The clawing marks of nails, fingernails, furrowed his face and
 chest. He was a madman!


 The deadly attack of Thig; his own violent avenging of Kam's death, and
 now the apparent return of the man he had killed come to life had all
 served to jolt his rigidly trained brain from its accustomed groove.
 The shock had been too much for the established thought-processes of
 the Orthan.


 So Thig shot him where he stood, mercifully, before that vacant mad
 stare set him, too, to gibbering and shrieking. Then he stepped over
 the skeleton-thing that had been Torp, using the new strength that
 victory had given him to drive him along.


 He had saved a world's civilization from extinction! The thought
 sobered him; yet, somehow, he was pleased that he had done so. After
 all, it had been the Earthwoman and the children he had been thinking
 of while he battled Kam, a selfish desire to protect them all.


 He went to the desk where Torp had been writing in the ship's log and
 read the last few nervously scrawled lines:
Planet 72-P-3 unfit for colonization. Some pernicious disease that
 strikes at the brain centers and causes violent insanity is existent
 there. Thig, just returned from a survey of the planet, went mad and
 destroyed Kam. In turn I was forced to slay him. But it is not ended.
 Already I feel the insidious virus of....
And there his writing ended abruptly.


 Thig nodded. That would do it. He set the automatic pilot for the
 planet Ortha. Unless a rogue asteroid or a comet crossed the ship's
 path she would return safely to Ortha with that mute warning of danger
 on 72-P-3. The body of Torp would help to confirm his final message.


 Then Thig crossed the cabin to the auxiliary life boat there, one of
 a half-dozen space ships in miniature nested within the great ship's
 hull, and cut free from the mother vessel.


 He flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the rockets driving
 him from the parent ship. The sensation of free flight against his new
 body was strangely exhilerating and heady. It was the newest of the
 emotions he had experienced on Earth since that day, so many months
 before, when he had felt the warmness of Ellen's lips tight against his.
Thig flipped the drive lever, felt the thrumming of the
 rockets driving him from the parent ship.
He swung about to the port, watched the flaming drive-rockets of the
 great exploratory ship hurl it toward far-away Ortha, and there was no
 regret in his mind that he was not returning to the planet of his first
 existence.


 He thought of the dull greys and blacks of his planet, of the
 monotonous routine of existence that had once been his—and his heart
 thrilled to the memories of the starry nights and perfect exciting days
 he had spent on his three month trip over Earth.


 He made a brief salute to the existence he had known, turned with a
 tiny sigh, and his fingers made brief adjustments in the controls. The
 rocket-thrum deepened, and the thin whistle of tenuous air clutching
 the ship echoed through the hull-plates.


 He thought of many things in those few moments. He watched the
 roundness of Earth flatten out, then take on the cup-like illusion
 that all planets had for an incoming ship. He reduced the drive of his
 rockets to a mere whisper, striving to control the impatience that
 crowded his mind.


 He shivered suddenly, remembering his utter callousness the first time
 he had sent a space ship whipping down toward the hills and valleys
 below. And there was a sickness within him when he fully realized that,
 despite his acquired memory and traits, he was an alien from outer
 space.


 He fingered the tiny scars that had completely obliterated the slight
 differences in his appearance from an Earthman's, and his fingers
 trembled a bit, as he bent and stared through the vision port. He said
 a brief prayer in his heart to a God whose presence he now felt very
 deeply. There were tears in the depths of his eyes, then, and memories
 were hot, bitter pains.
Earth was not far below him. As he let gravity suck him earthward, he
 heaved a gasp of relief. He was no longer Thig, a creature of a Horde's
 creation, but Lewis Terry, writer of lurid gun-smoking tales of the
 West. He must remember that always. He had destroyed the real Terry and
 now, for the rest of his life, he must make up to the dead man's family.


 The knowledge that Ellen's love was not really meant for him would be
 a knife twisting in his heart but for her sake he must endure it. Her
 dreams and happiness must never be shattered.


 The bulge of Earth was flattening out now and he could see the outlines
 of Long Island in the growing twilight.


 A new plot was growing in the brain of Lewis Terry, a yarn about a
 cowboy suddenly transported to another world. He smiled ironically.
 He had seen those other worlds. Perhaps some day he would write about
 them....


 He was Lewis Terry! He must remember that!

I admit it: I didn't know if I was coming or
 
going—but I know that if I stuck to the old
 
man, I was a comer ... even if he was a goner!
Doc had this solemn human by the throat when I caught up with him.


 ""Tonight,"" Doc was saying in his old voice that was as crackled and
 important as parchment, ""tonight Man will reach the Moon. The golden
 Moon and the silver ship, symbols of greed. Tonight is the night when
 this is to happen.""


 ""Sure,"" the man agreed severely, prying a little worriedly at Doc's
 arthritic fingers that were clamped on his collar. ""No argument. Sure,
 up we go. But leave me go or, so help me, I'll fetch you one in the
 teeth!""


 I came alongside and carefully started to lever the old man loose,
 one finger at a time. It had to be done this way. I had learned that
 during all these weeks and months. His hands looked old and crippled,
 but I felt they were the strongest in the world. If a half dozen winos
 in Seattle hadn't helped me get them loose, Doc and I would have been
 wanted for the murder of a North American Mountie.


 It was easier this night and that made me afraid. Doc's thin frame,
 layered with lumpy fat, was beginning to muscle-dance against my side.
 One of his times was coming on him. Then at last he was free of the
 greasy collar of the human.


 ""I hope you'll forgive him, sir,"" I said, not meeting the man's eyes.
 ""He's my father and very old, as you can see."" I laughed inside at the
 absurd, easy lie. ""Old events seem recent to him.""


 The human nodded, Adam's apple jerking in the angry neon twilight.
 ""'Memory Jump,' you mean. All my great-grandfathers have it. But
 Great-great-grandmother Lupos, funny thing, is like a schoolgirl.
 Sharp, you know. I.... Say, the poor old guy looks sick. Want any help?""


 I told the human no, thanks, and walked Doc toward the flophouse three
 doors down. I hoped we would make it. I didn't know what would happen
 if we didn't. Doc was liable to say something that might nova Sol, for
 all I knew.
Martians approaching the corner were sensing at Doc and me. They
 were just cheap tourists slumming down on Skid Row. I hated tourists
 and especially I hated Martian tourists because I especially hated
 Martians. They were
aliens
. They weren't
men
like Doc and me.


 Then I realized what was about to happen. It was foolish and awful and
 true. I was going to have one of mine at the same time Doc was having
 his. That was bad. It had happened a few times right after I first
 found him, but now it was worse. For some undefinable reason, I felt we
 kept getting closer each of the times.


 I tried not to think about it and helped Doc through the fly-specked
 flophouse doors.


 The tubercular clerk looked up from the gaudy comics sections of one of
 those little tabloids that have the funnies a week in advance.


 ""Fifteen cents a bed,"" he said mechanically.


 ""We'll use one bed,"" I told him. ""I'll give you twenty cents."" I felt
 the round hard quarter in my pocket, sweaty hand against sticky lining.


 ""Fifteen cents a bed,"" he played it back for me.


 Doc was quivering against me, his legs boneless.


 ""We can always make it over to the mission,"" I lied.


 The clerk turned his upper lip as if he were going to spit. ""Awright,
 since we ain't full up. In
ad
vance.""


 I placed the quarter on the desk.


 ""Give me a nickel.""


 The clerk's hand fell on the coin and slid it off into the unknown
 before I could move, what with holding up Doc.


 ""You've got your nerve,"" he said at me with a fine mist of dew. ""Had a
 quarter all along and yet you Martian me down to twenty cents."" He saw
 the look on my face. ""I'll give you a
room
for the two bits. That's
 better'n a bed for twenty.""


 I knew I was going to need that nickel.
Desperately.
I reached across
 the desk with my free hand and hauled the scrawny human up against the
 register hard. I'm not as strong in my hands as Doc, but I managed.


 ""Give me a nickel,"" I said.


 ""What nickel?"" His eyes were big, but they kept looking right at me.
 ""You don't have any nickel. You don't have any quarter, not if I say
 so. Want I should call a cop and tell him you were flexing a muscle?""


 I let go of him. He didn't scare me, but Doc was beginning to mumble
 and that
did
scare me. I had to get him alone.


 ""Where's the room?"" I asked.
The room was six feet in all directions and the walls were five feet
 high. The other foot was finished in chicken wire. There was a wino
 singing on the left, a wino praying on the right, and the door didn't
 have any lock on it. At last, Doc and I were alone.


 I laid Doc out on the gray-brown cot and put his forearm over his face
 to shield it some from the glare of the light bulb. I swept off all the
 bedbugs in sight and stepped on them heavily.


 Then I dropped down into the painted stool chair and let my burning
 eyes rest on the obscene wall drawings just to focus them. I was so
 dirty, I could feel the grime grinding together all over me. My shaggy
 scalp still smarted from the alcohol I had stolen from a convertible's
 gas tank to get rid of Doc's and my cooties. Lucky that I never needed
 to shave and that my face was so dirty, no one would even notice that I
 didn't need to.


 The cramp hit me and I folded out of the chair onto the littered,
 uncovered floor.


 It stopped hurting, but I knew it would begin if I moved. I stared at a
 jagged cut-out nude curled against a lump of dust and lint, giving it
 an unreal distortion.


 Doc began to mumble louder.


 I knew I had to move.


 I waited just a moment, savoring the painless peace. Then, finally, I
 moved.


 I was bent double, but I got from the floor to the chair and found
 my notebook and orb-point in my hands. I found I couldn't focus both
 my mind and my eyes through the electric flashes of agony, so I
 concentrated on Doc's voice and trusted my hands would follow their
 habit pattern and construct the symbols for his words. They were
 suddenly distinguishable.
""

His voice rose to a meaningless wail that stretched into non-existence.
 The pen slid across the scribbled face of the notebook and both dropped
 from my numb hands. But I knew. Somehow, inside me,
I knew
that these
 words were what I had been waiting for. They told everything I needed
 to know to become the most powerful man in the Solar Federation.


 That wasn't just an addict's dream. I knew who Doc was. When I got
 to thinking it was just a dream and that I was dragging this old man
 around North America for nothing, I remembered who he was.


 I remembered that he was somebody very important whose name and work I
 had once known, even if now I knew him only as Doc.


 Pain was a pendulum within me, swinging from low throbbing bass to high
 screaming tenor. I had to get out and get some. But I didn't have a
 nickel. Still, I had to get some.


 I crawled to the door and raised myself by the knob, slick with greasy
 dirt. The door opened and shut—there was no lock. I shouldn't leave
 Doc alone, but I had to.


 He was starting to cry. He didn't always do that.


 I listened to him for a moment, then tested and tasted the craving that
 crawled through my veins. I got back inside somehow.


 Doc was twisting on the cot, tears washing white streaks across his
 face. I shoved Doc's face up against my chest. I held onto him and let
 him bellow. I soothed the lanks of soiled white hair back over his
 lumpy skull.


 He shut up at last and I laid him down again and put his arm back
 across his face. (You can't turn the light off and on in places like
 that. The old wiring will blow the bulb half the time.)


 I don't remember how I got out onto the street.
She was pink and clean and her platinum hair was pulled straight back,
 drawing her cheek-bones tighter, straightening her wide, appealing
 mouth, drawing her lean, athletic, feminine body erect. She was wearing
 a powder-blue dress that covered all of her breasts and hips and the
 upper half of her legs.


 The most wonderful thing about her was her perfume. Then I realized it
 wasn't perfume, only the scent of soap. Finally, I knew it wasn't that.
 It was just healthy, fresh-scrubbed skin.


 I went to her at the bus stop, forcing my legs not to stagger. Nobody
 would help a drunk. I don't know why, but nobody will help you if they
 think you are blotto.


 ""Ma'am, could you help a man who's not had work?"" I kept my eyes down.
 I couldn't look a human in the eye and ask for help. ""Just a dime for a
 cup of coffee."" I knew where I could get it for three cents, maybe two
 and a half.


 I felt her looking at me. She spoke in an educated voice, one she used,
 perhaps, as a teacher or supervising telephone operator. ""Do you want
 it for coffee, or to apply, or a glass or hypo of something else?""


 I cringed and whined. She would expect it of me. I suddenly realized
 that anybody as clean as she was had to be a tourist here. I hate
 tourists.


 ""Just coffee, ma'am."" She was younger than I was, so I didn't have to
 call her that. ""A little more for food, if you could spare it.""


 I hadn't eaten in a day and a half, but I didn't care much.


 ""I'll buy you a dinner,"" she said carefully, ""provided I can go with
 you and see for myself that you actually eat it.""


 I felt my face flushing red. ""You wouldn't want to be seen with a bum
 like me, ma'am.""


 ""I'll be seen with you if you really want to eat.""


 It was certainly unfair and probably immoral. But I had no choice
 whatever.


 ""Okay,"" I said, tasting bitterness over the craving.
The coffee was in a thick white cup before me on the counter. It was
 pale, grayish brown and steaming faintly. I picked it up in both hands
 to feel its warmth.


 Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the woman sitting on the stool
 beside me. She had no right to intrude. This moment should be mine, but
 there she sat, marring it for me, a contemptible
tourist
.


 I gulped down the thick, dark liquid brutally. It was all I could
 do. The cramp flowed out of my diaphragm. I took another swallow and
 was able to think straight again. A third swallow and I felt—good.
 Not abnormally stimulated, but strong, alert, poised on the brink of
 exhilaration.


 That was what coffee did for me.


 I was a caffeine addict.


 Earth-norm humans sometimes have the addiction to a slight extent, but
 I knew that as a Centurian I had it infinitely worse. Caffeine affected
 my metabolism like a pure alkaloid. The immediate effects weren't the
 same, but the
need
ran as deep.


 I finished the cup. I didn't order another because I wasn't a pure
 sensualist. I just needed release. Sometimes, when I didn't have the
 price of a cup, I would look around in alleys and find cola bottles
 with a few drops left in them. They have a little caffeine in
 them—not enough, never enough, but better than nothing.


 ""Now what do you want to eat?"" the woman asked.


 I didn't look at her. She didn't know. She thought I was a human—an
Earth
human. I was a
man
, of course, not an
alien
like a Martian.
 Earthmen ran the whole Solar Federation, but I was just as good as an
 Earthman. With my suntan and short mane, I could pass, couldn't I? That
 proved it, didn't it?


 ""Hamburger,"" I said. ""Well done."" I knew that would probably be all
 they had fit to eat at a place like this. It might be horse meat, but
 then I didn't have the local prejudices.


 I didn't look at the woman. I couldn't. But I kept remembering how
 clean she looked and I was aware of how clean she smelled. I was so
 dirty, so very dirty that I could never get clean if I bathed every
 hour for the rest of my life.


 The hamburger was engulfed by five black-crowned, broken fingernails
 and raised to two rows of yellow ivory. I surrounded it like an ameba,
 almost in a single movement of my jaws.


 Several other hamburgers followed the first. I lost count. I drank a
 glass of milk. I didn't want to black out on coffee with Doc waiting
 for me.


 ""Could I have a few to take with me, miss?"" I pleaded.


 She smiled. I caught that out of the edge of my vision, but mostly I
 just felt it.


 ""That's the first time you've called me anything but 'ma'am',"" she
 said. ""I'm not an old-maid schoolteacher, you know.""


 That probably meant she was a schoolteacher, though. ""No, miss,"" I said.


 ""It's Miss Casey—Vivian Casey,"" she corrected. She was a
 schoolteacher, all right. No other girl would introduce herself as Miss
 Last Name. Then there was something in her voice....


 ""What's your name?"" she said to me.


 I choked a little on a bite of stale bun.


 I
had
a name,
of course
.
Everybody has a name, and I knew if I went off somewhere quiet and
 thought about it, mine would come to me. Meanwhile, I would tell the
 girl that my name was ... Kevin O'Malley. Abruptly I realized that that
was
my name.


 ""Kevin,"" I told her. ""John Kevin.""


 ""Mister Kevin,"" she said, her words dancing with bright absurdity like
 waterhose mist on a summer afternoon, ""I wonder if you could help
me
.""


 ""Happy to, miss,"" I mumbled.


 She pushed a white rectangle in front of me on the painted maroon bar.
 ""What do you think of this?""


 I looked at the piece of paper. It was a coupon from a magazine.
Dear Acolyte R. I. S.
:
Please send me FREE of obligation, in sealed wrapper, ""The Scarlet
 Book"" revealing to me how I may gain Secret Mastery of the Universe.

 The world disoriented itself and I was on the floor of the somber diner
 and Miss Vivian Casey was out of sight and scent.


 There was a five dollar bill tight in my fist. The counterman was
 trying to pull it out.


 I looked up at his stubbled face. ""I had half a dozen hamburgers, a
 cup of coffee and a glass of milk. I want four more 'burgers to go and
 a pint of coffee. By your prices, that will be one sixty-five—if the
 lady didn't pay you.""


 ""She didn't,"" he stammered. ""Why do you think I was trying to get that
 bill out of your hand?""


 I didn't say anything, just got up off the floor. After the counterman
 put down my change, I spread out the five dollar bill on the vacant
 bar, smoothing it.


 I scooped up my change and walked out the door. There was no one on the
 sidewalk, only in the doorways.
First I opened the door on an amber world, then an azure one. Neon
 light was coming from the chickenwire border of the room, from a window
 somewhere beyond. The wino on one side of the room was singing and
 the one on the other side was praying, same as before. Only they had
 changed around—prayer came from the left, song from the right.


 Doc sat on the floor in the half-darkness and he had made a
thing
.
My heart hammered at my lungs. I
knew
this last time had been
 different. Whatever it was was getting closer. This was the first time
 Doc had ever made anything. It didn't look like much, but it was a
 start.


 He had broken the light bulb and used the filament and screw bottom.
 His strong hands had unraveled some of the bed ""springs""—metal
 webbing—and fashioned them to his needs. My orb-point pen had
 dissolved under his touch. All of them, useless parts, were made into a
 meaningful whole.


 I knew the thing had meaning, but when I tried to follow its design, I
 became lost.


 I put the paper container of warm coffee and the greasy bag of
 hamburgers on the wooden chair, hoping the odor wouldn't bring any
 hungry rats out of the walls.


 I knelt beside Doc.


 ""An order, my boy, an order,"" he whispered.


 I didn't know what he meant. Was he suddenly trying to give me orders?


 He held something out to me. It was my notebook. He had used my pen,
 before dismantling it, to write something. I tilted the notebook
 against the neon light, now red wine, now fresh grape. I read it.


 ""Concentrate,"" Doc said hoarsely. ""Concentrate....""


 I wondered what the words meant. Wondering takes a kind of
 concentration.


 The words ""First Edition"" were what I was thinking about most.
The heavy-set man in the ornate armchair was saying, ""The bullet struck
 me as I was pulling on my boot....""


 I was kneeling on the floor of a Victorian living room. I'm quite
 familiar with Earth history and I recognized the period immediately.


 Then I realized what I had been trying to get from Doc all these
 months—time travel.


 A thin, sickly man was sprawled in the other chair in a rumpled
 dressing gown. My eyes held to his face, his pinpoint pupils and
 whitened nose. He was a condemned snowbird! If there was anything I
 hated or held in more contempt than tourists or Martians, it was a
 snowbird.


 ""My clients have occasioned singular methods of entry into these
 rooms,"" the thin man remarked, ""but never before have they used
 instantaneous materialization.""


 The heavier man was half choking, half laughing. ""I say—I say, I would
 like to see you explain this, my dear fellow.""


 ""I have no data,"" the thin man answered coolly. ""In such instance, one
 begins to twist theories into fact, or facts into theories. I must ask
 this unemployed, former professional man who has gone through a serious
 illness and is suffering a more serious addiction to tell me the place
 and
time
from which he comes.""


 The surprise stung. ""How did you know?"" I asked.


 He gestured with a pale hand. ""To maintain a logical approach, I must
 reject the supernatural. Your arrival, unless hallucinatory—and
 despite my voluntary use of one drug and my involuntary experiences
 recently with another, I must accept the evidence of my senses or
 retire from my profession—your arrival was then super-normal. I might
 say super-scientific, of a science not of my or the good doctor's time,
 clearly. Time travel is a familiar folk legend and I have been reading
 an article by the entertaining Mr. Wells. Perhaps he will expand it
 into one of his novels of scientific romance.""


 I knew who these two men were, with a tormenting doubt. ""But the
 other—""


 ""Your hands, though unclean, have never seen physical labor. Your
 cranial construction is of a superior type, or even if you reject my
 theories, concentration does set the facial features. I judge you have
 suffered an illness because of the inhibition of your beard growth.
 Your over-fondness for rum or opium, perhaps, is self-evident. You
 are at too resilient an age to be so sunk by even an amour. Why else
 then would you let yourself fall into such an underfed and unsanitary
 state?""
He was so smug and so sure, this snowbird. I hated him. Because I
 couldn't trust to my own senses as he did.


 ""You don't exist,"" I said slowly, painfully. ""You are fictional
 creations.""


 The doctor flushed darkly. ""You give my literary agent too much credit
 for the addition of professional polish to my works.""


 The other man was filling a large, curved pipe from something that
 looked vaguely like an ice-skate. ""Interesting. Perhaps if our visitor
 would tell us something of his age with special reference to the theory
 and practice of temporal transference, Doctor, we would be better
 equipped to judge whether we exist.""


 There was no theory or practice of time travel. I told them all I had
 ever heard theorized from Hindu yoga through Extra-sensory Perception
 to Relativity and the positron and negatron.


 ""Interesting."" He breathed out suffocating black clouds of smoke.
 ""Presume that the people of your time by their 'Extra-sensory
 Perception' have altered the past to make it as they suppose it to be.
 The great historical figures are made the larger than life-size that we
 know them. The great literary creations assume reality.""


 I thought of Cleopatra and Helen of Troy and wondered if they would be
 the goddesses of love that people imagined or the scrawny, big-nosed
 redhead and fading old woman of scholarship. Then I noticed the
 detective's hand that had been resting idly on a round brass weight of
 unknown sort to me. His tapered fingertips had indented the metal.


 His bright eyes followed mine and he smiled faintly. ""Withdrawal
 symptoms.""


 The admiration and affection for this man that had been slowly building
 up behind my hatred unbrinked. I remembered now that he had stopped. He
 was not
really
a snowbird.


 After a time, I asked the doctor a question.


 ""Why, yes. I'm flattered. This is the first manuscript. Considering my
 professional handwriting, I recopied it more laboriously.""
Accepting the sheaf of papers and not looking back at these two great
 and good men, I concentrated on my own time and Doc. Nothing happened.
 My heart raced, but I saw something dancing before me like a dust mote
 in sunlight and stepped toward it....


 ... into the effective range of Miss Casey's tiny gun.
She inclined the lethal silver toy. ""Let me see those papers, Kevin.""


 I handed her the doctor's manuscript.


 Her breath escaped slowly and loudly. ""It's all right. It's all right.
 It exists. It's real. Not even one of the unwritten ones. I've read
 this myself.""


 Doc was lying on the cot, half his face twisted into horror.


 ""Don't move, Kevin,"" she said. ""I'll have to shoot you—maybe not to
 kill, but painfully.""


 I watched her face flash blue, red, blue and knew she meant it. But I
 had known too much in too short a time. I had to help Doc, but there
 was something else.


 ""I just want a drink of coffee from that container on the chair,"" I
 told her.


 She shook her head. ""I don't know what you think it does to you.""


 It was getting hard for me to think. ""Who are you?""


 She showed me a card from her wrist purse. Vivian Casey, Constable,
 North American Mounted Police.


 I had to help Doc. I had to have some coffee. ""What do you want?""


 ""Listen, Kevin. Listen carefully to what I am saying. Doc found
 a method of time travel. It was almost a purely mathematical,
 topographical way divorced from modern physical sciences. He kept it
 secret and he wanted to make money with it. He was an idealist—he had
 his crusades. How can you make money with time travel?""


 I didn't know whether she was asking me, but I didn't know. All I knew
 was that I had to help Doc and get some coffee.


 ""It takes money—money Doc didn't have—to make money,"" Miss Casey
 said, ""even if you know what horse will come in and what stock will
 prosper. Besides, horse-racing and the stock market weren't a part of
 Doc's character. He was a scholar.""


 Why did she keep using the past tense in reference to Doc? It scared
 me. He was lying so still with the left side of his face so twisted. I
 needed some coffee.


 ""He became a book finder. He got rare editions of books and magazines
 for his clients in absolutely mint condition. That was all right—until
 he started obtaining books that
did not exist
.""
I didn't know what all that was supposed to mean. I got to the chair,
 snatched up the coffee container, tore it open and gulped down the
 soothing liquid.


 I turned toward her and threw the rest of the coffee into her face.


 The coffee splashed out over her platinum hair and powder-blue dress
 that looked white when the neon was azure, purple when it was amber.
 The coffee stained and soiled and ruined, and I was fiercely glad,
 unreasonably happy.


 I tore the gun away from her by the short barrel, not letting my filthy
 hands touch her scrubbed pink ones.


 I pointed the gun generally at her and backed around the
thing
on the
 floor to the cot. Doc had a pulse, but it was irregular. I checked for
 a fever and there wasn't one. After that, I didn't know what to do.


 I looked up finally and saw a Martian in or about the doorway.


 ""Call me Andre,"" the Martian said. ""A common name but foreign. It
 should serve as a point of reference.""


 I had always wondered how a thing like a Martian could talk. Sometimes
 I wondered if they really could.


 ""You won't need the gun,"" Andre said conversationally.


 ""I'll keep it, thanks. What do
you
want?""


 ""I'll begin as Miss Casey did—by telling you things. Hundreds of
 people disappeared from North America a few months ago.""


 ""They always do,"" I told him.


 ""They ceased to exist—as human beings—shortly after they received a
 book from Doc,"" the Martian said.


 Something seemed to strike me in the back of the neck. I staggered, but
 managed to hold onto the gun and stand up.


 ""Use one of those sneaky Martian weapons again,"" I warned him,
 ""and I'll kill the girl."" Martians were supposed to be against the
 destruction of any life-form, I had read someplace. I doubted it, but
 it was worth a try.


 ""Kevin,"" Andre said, ""why don't you take a bath?""


 The Martian weapon staggered me again. I tried to say something. I
 tried to explain that I was so dirty that I could never get clean no
 matter how often I bathed. No words formed.


 ""But, Kevin,"" Andre said, ""you aren't
that
dirty.""
The blow shook the gun from my fingers. It almost fell into the
thing
on the floor, but at the last moment seemed to change direction and
 miss it.


 I knew something. ""I don't wash because I drink coffee.""


 ""It's all right to drink coffee, isn't it?"" he asked.


 ""Of course,"" I said, and added absurdly, ""That's why I don't wash.""


 ""You mean,"" Andre said slowly, ploddingly, ""that if you bathed, you
 would be admitting that drinking coffee was in the same class as any
 other solitary vice that makes people wash frequently.""


 I was knocked to my knees.


 ""Kevin,"" the Martian said, ""drinking coffee represents a major vice
 only in Centurian humanoids, not Earth-norm human beings.
Which are
 you?
""


 Nothing came out of my gabbling mouth.


 ""
What is Doc's full name?
""


 I almost fell in, but at the last instant I caught myself and said,
 ""Doctor Kevin O'Malley, Senior.""


 From the bed, Doc said a word. ""Son.""


 Then he disappeared.


 I looked at that which he had made. I wondered where he had gone, in
 search of what.


 ""He didn't use that,"" Andre said.


 So I was an Earthman, Doc's son. So my addiction to coffee was all in
 my mind. That didn't change anything. They say sex is all in your mind.
 I didn't want to be cured. I wouldn't be. Doc was gone. That was all I
 had now. That and the
thing
he left.


 ""The rest is simple,"" Andre said. ""Doc O'Malley bought up all the stock
 in a certain ancient metaphysical order and started supplying members
 with certain books. Can you imagine the effect of the
Book of Dyzan
or the
Book of Thoth
or the
Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan
or the
Necronomican
itself on human beings?""


 ""But they don't exist,"" I said wearily.


 ""Exactly, Kevin, exactly. They have never existed any more than your
 Victorian detective friend. But the unconscious racial mind has reached
 back into time and created them. And that unconscious mind, deeper than
 psychology terms the subconscious, has always known about the powers
 of ESP, telepathy, telekinesis, precognition. Through these books,
 the human race can tell itself how to achieve a state of pure logic,
 without food, without sex, without conflict—just as Doc has achieved
 such a state—a little late, true. He had a powerful guilt complex,
 even stronger than your withdrawal, over releasing this blessing on
 the inhabited universe, but reason finally prevailed. He had reached a
 state of pure thought.""


 ""The North American government
has
to have this secret, Kevin,"" the
 girl said. ""You can't let it fall into the hands of the Martians.""
Andre did not deny that he wanted it to fall into his hands.


 I knew I could not let Doc's—Dad's—time travel
thing
fall into
 anyone's hands. I remembered that all the copies of the books had
 disappeared with their readers now. There must not be any more, I knew.


 Miss Casey did her duty and tried to stop me with a judo hold, but I
 don't think her heart was in it, because I reversed and broke it.


 I kicked the
thing
to pieces and stomped on the pieces. Maybe you
 can't stop the progress of science, but I knew it might be millenniums
 before Doc's genes and creative environment were recreated and time
 travel was rediscovered. Maybe we would be ready for it then. I knew we
 weren't now.


 Miss Casey leaned against my dirty chest and cried into it. I didn't
 mind her touching me.


 ""I'm glad,"" she said.


 Andre flowed out of the doorway with a sigh. Of relief?


 I would never know. I supposed I had destroyed
it
because I didn't
 want the human race to become a thing of pure reason without purpose,
 direction or love, but I would never know for sure. I thought I could
 kick the habit—perhaps with Miss Casey's help—but I wasn't really
 confident.


 Maybe I had destroyed the time machine because a world without material
 needs would not grow and roast coffee.

Getting specimens for the interstellar zoo
 
was no problem—they battled for the honor—but
 
now I had to fight like a wildcat to
 
keep a display from making a monkey of me!
It was our first day of recruiting on the planet, and the alien
 life-forms had lined up for hundreds of feet back from my rented
 office. As I came down the block from the hotel, I could hear and see
 and smell them with ease.


 My three staff men, Auchinleck, Stebbins and Ludlow, walked shieldwise
 in front of me. I peered between them to size the crop up. The aliens
 came in every shape and form, in all colors and textures—and all of
 them eager for a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy is full of bizarre
 beings, but there's barely a species anywhere that can resist the old
 exhibitionist urge.


 ""Send them in one at a time,"" I told Stebbins. I ducked into the
 office, took my place back of the desk and waited for the procession to
 begin.


 The name of the planet was MacTavish IV (if you went by the official
 Terran listing) or Ghryne (if you called it by what its people were
 accustomed to calling it). I thought of it privately as MacTavish IV
 and referred to it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in keeping the locals
 happy wherever I go.


 Through the front window of the office, I could see our big gay tridim
 sign plastered to a facing wall: WANTED—EXTRATERRESTRIALS! We had
 saturated MacTavish IV with our promotional poop for a month preceding
 arrival. Stuff like this:
Want to visit Earth—see the Galaxy's most glittering and exclusive
 world? Want to draw good pay, work short hours, experience the thrills
 of show business on romantic Terra? If you are a non-terrestrial,
 there may be a place for you in the Corrigan Institute of
 Morphological Science. No freaks wanted—normal beings only. J. F.
 Corrigan will hold interviews in person on Ghryne from Thirdday to
 Fifthday of Tenmonth. His last visit to the Caledonia Cluster until
 2937, so don't miss your chance! Hurry! A life of wonder and riches
 can be yours!
Broadsides like that, distributed wholesale in half a thousand
 languages, always bring them running. And the Corrigan Institute really
 packs in the crowds back on Earth. Why not? It's the best of its kind,
 the only really decent place where Earthmen can get a gander at the
 other species of the universe.


 The office buzzer sounded. Auchinleck said unctuously, ""The first
 applicant is ready to see you, sir.""


 ""Send him, her or it in.""


 The door opened and a timid-looking life-form advanced toward me on
 nervous little legs. He was a globular creature about the size of a
 big basketball, yellowish-green, with two spindly double-kneed legs and
 five double-elbowed arms, the latter spaced regularly around his body.
 There was a lidless eye at the top of his head and five lidded ones,
 one above each arm. Plus a big, gaping, toothless mouth.
His voice was a surprisingly resounding basso. ""You are Mr. Corrigan?""


 ""That's right."" I reached for a data blank. ""Before we begin, I'll need
 certain information about—""


 ""I am a being of Regulus II,"" came the grave, booming reply, even
 before I had picked up the blank. ""I need no special care and I am not
 a fugitive from the law of any world.""


 ""Your name?""


 ""Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.""


 I throttled my exclamation of surprise, concealing it behind a quick
 cough. ""Let me have that again, please?""


 ""Certainly. My name is Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. The 'R' stands for
 Raymond.""


 ""Of course, that's not the name you were born with.""


 The being closed his eyes and toddled around in a 360-degree rotation,
 remaining in place. On his world, that gesture is the equivalent of
 an apologetic smile. ""My Regulan name no longer matters. I am now and
 shall evermore be Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a Terraphile, you see.""
The little Regulan was as good as hired. Only the formalities remained.
 ""You understand our terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?""


 ""I'll be placed on exhibition at your Institute on Earth. You'll pay
 for my services, transportation and expenses. I'll be required to
 remain on exhibit no more than one-third of each Terran sidereal day.""


 ""And the pay will be—ah—$50 Galactic a week, plus expenses and
 transportation.""


 The spherical creature clapped his hands in joy, three hands clapping
 on one side, two on the other. ""Wonderful! I will see Earth at last! I
 accept the terms!""


 I buzzed for Ludlow and gave him the fast signal that meant we were
 signing this alien up at half the usual pay, and Ludlow took him into
 the other office to sign him up.


 I grinned, pleased with myself. We needed a green Regulan in our show;
 the last one had quit four years ago. But just because we needed him
 didn't mean we had to be extravagant in hiring him. A Terraphile alien
 who goes to the extent of rechristening himself with a Terran monicker
 would work for nothing, or even pay us, just so long as we let him get
 to Earth. My conscience won't let me really
exploit
a being, but I
 don't believe in throwing money away, either.


 The next applicant was a beefy ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our outfit
 has all the ursinoids it needs or is likely to need in the next few
 decades, and so I got rid of him in a couple of minutes. He was
 followed by a roly-poly blue-skinned humanoid from Donovan's Planet,
 four feet high and five hundred pounds heavy. We already had a couple
 of his species in the show, but they made good crowd-pleasers, being
 so plump and cheerful. I passed him along to Auchinleck to sign at
 anything short of top rate.


 Next came a bedraggled Sirian spider who was more interested in a
 handout than a job. If there's any species we have a real over-supply
 of, it's those silver-colored spiders, but this seedy specimen gave it
 a try anyway. He got the gate in half a minute, and he didn't even get
 the handout he was angling for. I don't approve of begging.


 The flora of applicants was steady. Ghryne is in the heart of the
 Caledonia Cluster, where the interstellar crossroads meet. We had
 figured to pick up plenty of new exhibits here and we were right.
It was the isolationism of the late 29th century that turned me into
 the successful proprietor of Corrigan's Institute, after some years
 as an impoverished carnival man in the Betelgeuse system. Back in
 2903, the World Congress declared Terra off-bounds for non-terrestrial
 beings, as an offshoot of the Terra for Terrans movement.


 Before then, anyone could visit Earth. After the gate clanged down,
 a non-terrestrial could only get onto Sol III as a specimen in a
 scientific collection—in short, as an exhibit in a zoo.


 That's what the Corrigan Institute of Morphological Science really is,
 of course. A zoo. But we don't go out and hunt for our specimens; we
 advertise and they come flocking to us. Every alien wants to see Earth
 once in his lifetime, and there's only one way he can do it.


 We don't keep too big an inventory. At last count, we had 690 specimens
 before this trip, representing 298 different intelligent life-forms.
 My goal is at least one member of at least 500 different races. When I
 reach that, I'll sit back and let the competition catch up—if it can.


 After an hour of steady work that morning, we had signed eleven new
 specimens. At the same time, we had turned away a dozen ursinoids,
 fifty of the reptilian natives of Ghryne, seven Sirian spiders, and no
 less than nineteen chlorine-breathing Procyonites wearing gas masks.


 It was also my sad duty to nix a Vegan who was negotiating through a
 Ghrynian agent. A Vegan would be a top-flight attraction, being some
 400 feet long and appropriately fearsome to the eye, but I didn't see
 how we could take one on. They're gentle and likable beings, but their
 upkeep runs into literally tons of fresh meat a day, and not just any
 old kind of meat either. So we had to do without the Vegan.


 ""One more specimen before lunch,"" I told Stebbins, ""to make it an even
 dozen.""


 He looked at me queerly and nodded. A being entered. I took a long
 close look at the life-form when it came in, and after that I took
 another one. I wondered what kind of stunt was being pulled. So far as
 I could tell, the being was quite plainly nothing but an Earthman.


 He sat down facing me without being asked and crossed his legs. He was
 tall and extremely thin, with pale blue eyes and dirty-blond hair, and
 though he was clean and reasonably well dressed, he had a shabby look
 about him. He said, in level Terran accents, ""I'm looking for a job
 with your outfit, Corrigan.""


 ""There's been a mistake. We're interested in non-terrestrials only.""


 ""I'm a non-terrestrial. My name is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Wazzenazz
 XIII.""
I don't mind conning the public from time to time, but I draw the line
 at getting bilked myself. ""Look, friend, I'm busy, and I'm not known
 for my sense of humor. Or my generosity.""


 ""I'm not panhandling. I'm looking for a job.""


 ""Then try elsewhere. Suppose you stop wasting my time, bud. You're as
 Earthborn as I am.""


 ""I've never been within a dozen parsecs of Earth,"" he said smoothly. ""I
 happen to be a representative of the only Earthlike race that exists
 anywhere in the Galaxy but on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is a small
 and little-known planet in the Crab Nebula. Through an evolutionary
 fluke, my race is identical with yours. Now, don't you want me in your
 circus?""


 ""No. And it's not a circus. It's—""


 ""A scientific institute. I stand corrected.""


 There was something glib and appealing about this preposterous phony. I
 guess I recognized a kindred spirit or I would have tossed him out on
 his ear without another word. Instead I played along. ""If you're from
 such a distant place, how come you speak English so well?""


 ""I'm not speaking. I'm a telepath—not the kind that reads minds, just
 the kind that projects. I communicate in symbols that you translate
 back to colloquial speech.""


 ""Very clever, Mr. Gorb."" I grinned at him and shook my head. ""You spin
 a good yarn—but for my money, you're really Sam Jones or Phil Smith
 from Earth, stranded here and out of cash. You want a free trip back to
 Earth. No deal. The demand for beings from Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low
 these days. Zero, in fact. Good-by, Mr. Gorb.""


 He pointed a finger squarely at me and said, ""You're making a big
 mistake. I'm just what your outfit needs. A representative of a
 hitherto utterly unknown race identical to humanity in every respect!
 Look here, examine my teeth. Absolutely like human teeth! And—""


 I pulled away from his yawning mouth. ""Good-by, Mr. Gorb,"" I repeated.


 ""All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. It isn't much. I'll be a big
 attraction. I'll—""


 ""
Good-by, Mr. Gorb!
""


 He glowered at me reproachfully for a moment, stood up and sauntered to
 the door. ""I thought you were a man of acumen, Corrigan. Well, think
 it over. Maybe you'll regret your hastiness. I'll be back to give you
 another chance.""


 He slammed the door and I let my grim expression relax into a smile.
 This was the best con switch yet—an Earthman posing as an alien to get
 a job!


 But I wasn't buying it, even if I could appreciate his cleverness
 intellectually. There's no such place as Wazzenazz XIII and there's
 only one human race in the Galaxy—on Earth. I was going to need some
 real good reason before I gave a down-and-out grifter a free ticket
 home.


 I didn't know it then, but before the day was out, I would have that
 reason. And, with it, plenty of trouble on my hands.
The first harbinger of woe turned up after lunch in the person of a
 Kallerian. The Kallerian was the sixth applicant that afternoon. I
 had turned away three more ursinoids, hired a vegetable from Miazan,
 and said no to a scaly pseudo-armadillo from one of the Delta Worlds.
 Hardly had the 'dillo scuttled dejectedly out of my office when the
 Kallerian came striding in, not even waiting for Stebbins to admit him
 officially.


 He was big even for his kind—in the neighborhood of nine feet high,
 and getting on toward a ton. He planted himself firmly on his three
 stocky feet, extended his massive arms in a Kallerian greeting-gesture,
 and growled, ""I am Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller IV. You will sign me
 immediately to a contract.""


 ""Sit down, Freeman Heraal. I like to make my own decisions, thanks.""


 ""You will grant me a contract!""


 ""Will you please sit down?""


 He said sulkily, ""I will remain standing.""


 ""As you prefer."" My desk has a few concealed features which are
 sometimes useful in dealing with belligerent or disappointed
 life-forms. My fingers roamed to the meshgun trigger, just in case of
 trouble.


 The Kallerian stood motionless before me. They're hairy creatures, and
 this one had a coarse, thick mat of blue fur completely covering his
 body. Two fierce eyes glimmered out through the otherwise dense blanket
 of fur. He was wearing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial blaster of his
 warlike race.


 I said, ""You'll have to understand, Freeman Heraal, that it's not our
 policy to maintain more than a few members of each species at our
 Institute. And we're not currently in need of any Kallerian males,
 because—""


 ""You will hire me or trouble I will make!""


 I opened our inventory chart. I showed him that we were already
 carrying four Kallerians, and that was more than plenty.


 The beady little eyes flashed like beacons in the fur. ""Yes, you have
 four representatives—of the Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan Gursdrinn!
 For three years, I have waited for a chance to avenge this insult to
 the noble Clan Gursdrinn!""


 At the key-word
avenge
, I readied myself to ensnarl the Kallerian
 in a spume of tanglemesh the instant he went for his blaster, but he
 didn't move. He bellowed, ""I have vowed a vow, Earthman. Take me to
 Earth, enroll a Gursdrinn, or the consequences will be terrible!""
I'm a man of principles, like all straightforward double-dealers, and
 one of the most important of those principles is that I never let
 myself be bullied by anyone. ""I deeply regret having unintentionally
 insulted your clan, Freeman Heraal. Will you accept my apologies?""


 He glared at me in silence.


 I went on, ""Please be assured that I'll undo the insult at the earliest
 possible opportunity. It's not feasible for us to hire another
 Kallerian now, but I'll give preference to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon
 as a vacancy—""


 ""No. You will hire me now.""


 ""It can't be done, Freeman Heraal. We have a budget, and we stick to
 it.""


 ""You will rue! I will take drastic measures!""


 ""Threats will get you nowhere, Freeman Heraal. I give you my word I'll
 get in touch with you as soon as our organization has room for another
 Kallerian. And now, please, there are many applicants waiting—""


 You'd think it would be sort of humiliating to become a specimen in a
 zoo, but most of these races take it as an honor. And there's always
 the chance that, by picking a given member of a race, we're insulting
 all the others.


 I nudged the trouble-button on the side of my desk and Auchinleck and
 Ludlow appeared simultaneously from the two doors at right and left.
 They surrounded the towering Kallerian and sweet-talkingly led him
 away. He wasn't minded to quarrel physically, or he could have knocked
 them both into the next city with a backhand swipe of his shaggy paw,
 but he kept up a growling flow of invective and threats until he was
 out in the hall.


 I mopped sweat from my forehead and began to buzz Stebbins for the next
 applicant. But before my finger touched the button, the door popped
 open and a small being came scooting in, followed by an angry Stebbins.


 ""Come here, you!""


 ""Stebbins?"" I said gently.


 ""I'm sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost sight of this one for a moment, and he
 came running in—""


 ""Please, please,"" squeaked the little alien pitifully. ""I must see you,
 honored sir!""


 ""It isn't his turn in line,"" Stebbins protested. ""There are at least
 fifty ahead of him.""
""All right,"" I said tiredly. ""As long as he's in here already, I might
 as well see him. Be more careful next time, Stebbins.""


 Stebbins nodded dolefully and backed out.
The alien was a pathetic sight: a Stortulian, a squirrely-looking
 creature about three feet high. His fur, which should have been a
 lustrous black, was a dull gray, and his eyes were wet and sad. His
 tail drooped. His voice was little more than a faint whimper, even at
 full volume.


 ""Begging your most honored pardon most humbly, important sir. I am a
 being of Stortul XII, having sold my last few possessions to travel
 to Ghryne for the miserable purpose of obtaining an interview with
 yourself.""


 I said, ""I'd better tell you right at the outset that we're already
 carrying our full complement of Stortulians. We have both a male and a
 female now and—""


 ""This is known to me. The female—is her name perchance Tiress?""


 I glanced down at the inventory chart until I found the Stortulian
 entry. ""Yes, that's her name.""


 The little being immediately emitted a soul-shaking gasp. ""It is she!
 It is she!""


 ""I'm afraid we don't have room for any more—""


 ""You are not in full understanding of my plight. The female Tiress,
 she is—was—my own Fire-sent spouse, my comfort and my warmth, my life
 and my love.""


 ""Funny,"" I said. ""When we signed her three years ago, she said she was
 single. It's right here on the chart.""


 ""She lied! She left my burrow because she longed to see the splendors
 of Earth. And I am alone, bound by our sacred customs never to remarry,
 languishing in sadness and pining for her return. You
must
take me to
 Earth!""


 ""But—""


 ""I must see her—her and this disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I must
 reason with her. Earthman, can't you see I must appeal to her inner
 flame?
I must bring her back!
""


 My face was expressionless. ""You don't really intend to join our
 organization at all—you just want free passage to Earth?""


 ""Yes, yes!"" wailed the Stortulian. ""Find some other member of my race,
 if you must! Let me have my wife again, Earthman! Is your heart a dead
 lump of stone?""
It isn't, but another of my principles is to refuse to be swayed by
 sentiment. I felt sorry for this being's domestic troubles, but I
 wasn't going to break up a good act just to make an alien squirrel
 happy—not to mention footing the transportation.


 I said, ""I don't see how we can manage it. The laws are very strict
 on the subject of bringing alien life to Earth. It has to be for
 scientific purposes only. And if I know in advance that your purpose in
 coming isn't scientific, I can't in all conscience
lie
for you, can
 I?""


 ""Well—""


 ""Of course not."" I took advantage of his pathetic upset to steam right
 along. ""Now if you had come in here and simply asked me to sign you up,
 I might conceivably have done it. But no—you had to go unburden your
 heart to me.""


 ""I thought the truth would move you.""


 ""It did. But in effect you're now asking me to conspire in a fraudulent
 criminal act. Friend, I can't do it. My reputation means too much to
 me,"" I said piously.


 ""Then you will refuse me?""


 ""My heart melts to nothingness for you. But I can't take you to Earth.""


 ""Perhaps you will send my wife to me here?""


 There's a clause in every contract that allows me to jettison an
 unwanted specimen. All I have to do is declare it no longer of
 scientific interest, and the World Government will deport the
 undesirable alien back to its home world. But I wouldn't pull a low
 trick like that on our female Stortulian.


 I said, ""I'll ask her about coming home. But I won't ship her back
 against her will. And maybe she's happier where she is.""


 The Stortulian seemed to shrivel. His eyelids closed half-way to mask
 his tears. He turned and shambled slowly to the door, walking like a
 living dishrag. In a bleak voice, he said, ""There is no hope then. All
 is lost. I will never see my soulmate again. Good day, Earthman.""


 He spoke in a drab monotone that almost, but not quite, had me weeping.
 I watched him shuffle out. I do have
some
conscience, and I had the
 uneasy feeling I had just been talking to a being who was about to
 commit suicide on my account.
About fifty more applicants were processed without a hitch. Then life
 started to get complicated again.


 Nine of the fifty were okay. The rest were unacceptable for one reason
 or another, and they took the bad news quietly enough. The haul for the
 day so far was close to two dozen new life-forms under contract.


 I had just about begun to forget about the incidents of the Kallerian's
 outraged pride and the Stortulian's flighty wife when the door opened
 and the Earthman who called himself Ildwar Gorb of Wazzenazz XIII
 stepped in.


 ""How did
you
get in here?"" I demanded.


 ""Your man happened to be looking the wrong way,"" he said cheerily.
 ""Change your mind about me yet?""


 ""Get out before I have you thrown out.""


 Gorb shrugged. ""I figured you hadn't changed your mind, so I've changed
 my pitch a bit. If you won't believe I'm from Wazzenazz XIII, suppose I
 tell you that I
am
Earthborn, and that I'm looking for a job on your
 staff.""


 ""I don't care
what
your story is! Get out or—""


 ""—you'll have me thrown out. Okay, okay. Just give me half a second.
 Corrigan, you're no fool, and neither am I—but that fellow of yours
 outside
is
. He doesn't know how to handle alien beings. How many
 times today has a life-form come in here unexpectedly?""


 I scowled at him. ""Too damn many.""


 ""You see? He's incompetent. Suppose you fire him, take me on instead.
 I've been living in the outworlds half my life; I know all there is to
 know about alien life-forms. You can use me, Corrigan.""


 I took a deep breath and glanced all around the paneled ceiling of
 the office before I spoke. ""Listen, Gorb, or whatever your name is,
 I've had a hard day. There's been a Kallerian in here who just about
 threatened murder, and there's been a Stortulian in here who's about
 to commit suicide because of me. I have a conscience and it's troubling
 me. But get this: I just want to finish off my recruiting, pack up and
 go home to Earth. I don't want you hanging around here bothering me.
 I'm not looking to hire new staff members, and if you switch back to
 claiming you're an unknown life-form from Wazzenazz XIII, the answer is
 that I'm not looking for any of
those
either. Now will you scram or—""


 The office door crashed open at that point and Heraal, the Kallerian,
 came thundering in. He was dressed from head to toe in glittering
 metalfoil, and instead of his ceremonial blaster, he was wielding
 a sword the length of a human being. Stebbins and Auchinleck came
 dragging helplessly along in his wake, hanging desperately to his belt.


 ""Sorry, Chief,"" Stebbins gasped. ""I tried to keep him out, but—""


 Heraal, who had planted himself in front of my desk, drowned him out
 with a roar. ""Earthman, you have mortally insulted the Clan Gursdrinn!""
Sitting with my hands poised near the meshgun trigger, I was ready to
 let him have it at the first sight of actual violence.


 Heraal boomed, ""You are responsible for what is to happen now. I have
 notified the authorities and you prosecuted will be for causing the
 death of a life-form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suffer!""


 ""Watch it, Chief,"" Stebbins yelled. ""He's going to—""


 An instant before my numb fingers could tighten on the meshgun
 trigger, Heraal swung that huge sword through the air and plunged it
 savagely through his body. He toppled forward onto the carpet with the
 sword projecting a couple of feet out of his back. A few driblets of
 bluish-purple blood spread from beneath him.


 Before I could react to the big life-form's hara-kiri, the office door
 flew open again and three sleek reptilian beings entered, garbed in the
 green sashes of the local police force. Their golden eyes goggled down
 at the figure on the floor, then came to rest on me.


 ""You are J. F. Corrigan?"" the leader asked.


 ""Y-yes.""


 ""We have received word of a complaint against you. Said complaint
 being—""


 ""—that your unethical actions have directly contributed to the
 untimely death of an intelligent life-form,"" filled in the second of
 the Ghrynian policemen.


 ""The evidence lies before us,"" intoned the leader, ""in the cadaver
 of the unfortunate Kallerian who filed the complaint with us several
 minutes ago.""


 ""And therefore,"" said the third lizard, ""it is our duty to arrest
 you for this crime and declare you subject to a fine of no less than
 $100,000 Galactic or two years in prison.""


 ""Hold on!"" I stormed. ""You mean that any being from anywhere in the
 Universe can come in here and gut himself on my carpet, and
I'm
responsible?""


 ""This is the law. Do you deny that your stubborn refusal to yield to
 this late life-form's request lies at the root of his sad demise?""


 ""Well, no, but—""


 ""Failure to deny is admission of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.""
Closing my eyes wearily, I tried to wish the whole babbling lot of them
 away. If I had to, I could pony up the hundred-grand fine, but it was
 going to put an awful dent in this year's take. And I shuddered when I
 remembered that any minute that scrawny little Stortulian was likely to
 come bursting in here to kill himself too. Was it a fine of $100,000
 per suicide? At that rate, I could be out of business by nightfall.


 I was spared further such morbid thoughts by yet another unannounced
 arrival.


 The small figure of the Stortulian trudged through the open doorway
 and stationed itself limply near the threshold. The three Ghrynian
 policemen and my three assistants forgot the dead Kallerian for a
 moment and turned to eye the newcomer.


 I had visions of unending troubles with the law here on Ghryne. I
 resolved never to come here on a recruiting trip again—or, if I
did
come, to figure out some more effective way of screening myself against
 crackpots.


 In heart-rending tones, the Stortulian declared, ""Life is no longer
 worth living. My last hope is gone. There is only one thing left for me
 to do.""


 I was quivering at the thought of another hundred thousand smackers
 going down the drain. ""Stop him, somebody! He's going to kill himself!
 He's—""


 Then somebody sprinted toward me, hit me amidships, and knocked me
 flying out from behind my desk before I had a chance to fire the
 meshgun. My head walloped the floor, and for five or six seconds, I
 guess I wasn't fully aware of what was going on.


 Gradually the scene took shape around me. There was a monstrous hole
 in the wall behind my desk; a smoking blaster lay on the floor, and I
 saw the three Ghrynian policemen sitting on the raving Stortulian. The
 man who called himself Ildwar Gorb was getting to his feet and dusting
 himself off.


 He helped me up. ""Sorry to have had to tackle you, Corrigan. But that
 Stortulian wasn't here to commit suicide, you see. He was out to get
 you.""


 I weaved dizzily toward my desk and dropped into my chair. A flying
 fragment of wall had deflated my pneumatic cushion. The smell of ashed
 plaster was everywhere. The police were effectively cocooning the
 struggling little alien in an unbreakable tanglemesh.


 ""Evidently you don't know as much as you think you do about Stortulian
 psychology, Corrigan,"" Gorb said lightly. ""Suicide is completely
 abhorrent to them. When they're troubled, they kill the person who
 caused their trouble. In this case, you.""
I began to chuckle—more of a tension-relieving snicker than a
 full-bodied laugh.


 ""Funny,"" I said.


 ""What is?"" asked the self-styled Wazzenazzian.


 ""These aliens. Big blustery Heraal came in with murder in his eye and
 killed
himself
, and the pint-sized Stortulian who looked so meek and
 pathetic damn near blew my head off."" I shuddered. ""Thanks for the
 tackle job.""


 ""Don't mention it,"" Gorb said.


 I glared at the Ghrynian police. ""Well? What are you waiting for? Take
 that murderous little beast out of here! Or isn't murder against the
 local laws?""


 ""The Stortulian will be duly punished,"" replied the leader of the
 Ghrynian cops calmly. ""But there is the matter of the dead Kallerian
 and the fine of—""


 ""—one hundred thousand dollars. I know."" I groaned and turned to
 Stebbins. ""Get the Terran Consulate on the phone, Stebbins. Have them
 send down a legal adviser. Find out if there's any way we can get out
 of this mess with our skins intact.""


 ""Right, Chief."" Stebbins moved toward the visiphone.


 Gorb stepped forward and put a hand on his chest.


 ""Hold it,"" the Wazzenazzian said crisply. ""The Consulate can't help
 you. I can.""


 ""You?"" I said.


 ""I can get you out of this cheap.""


 ""
How
cheap?""


 Gorb grinned rakishly. ""Five thousand in cash plus a contract as a
 specimen with your outfit. In advance, of course. That's a heck of a
 lot better than forking over a hundred grand, isn't it?""


 I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The Terran Consulate people probably wouldn't
 be much help; they tried to keep out of local squabbles unless they
 were really serious, and I knew from past experiences that no officials
 ever worried much about the state of my pocketbook. On the other hand,
 giving this slyster a contract might be a risky proposition.


 ""Tell you what,"" I said finally. ""You've got yourself a deal—but on
 a contingency basis. Get me out of this and you'll have five grand and
 the contract. Otherwise, nothing.""


 Gorb shrugged. ""What have I to lose?""

It's my first go at delivering a baby by caesarean section – and the foetal head is impacted, jammed in its mother's pelvis. To be honest I'm struggling. 

 Incisions have been made in the lower part of the mother's abdomen and womb. I've pushed my gloved hand inside and managed to slide my fingers between the baby's head and the surrounding uterine tissue. But it's difficult. The baby is tightly wedged in. I've had to push hard to get my hand to the far side of its head, and even though I'm now cupping and grasping it in the approved manner, I can't seem to pull it out. Dare I grip its head more firmly? Dare I pull harder?  

 The baby's mother – she's called Debra – remains impassive throughout these agonised fumblings. Her face reveals nothing of what she may be feeling. But then Debra has no feelings. Indeed she has no face…  

 So you can stop worrying. Debra – Desperate Debra to use her full trade name – is a simulator designed to help doctors practise their skill at dealing with impacted foetuses: babies that get stuck trying to exit the womb by the normal route. She comprises the lower two thirds (ie from the mid-chest region downwards) of a life-sized but limbless female torso made of flesh-coloured silicone rubber. She comes with a vulva, a pre-cut incision in her abdomen and, most importantly, a uterus containing a foetal head that should, in the normal way of things, be free to emerge between her legs. But this fetus is going nowhere until an obstetrician – or in this case me – can successfully grasp and pull it out.  

 The clever and sophisticated simulator I'm playing with started life as a lash-up in an obstetrician's home workshop: a Heath Robinson-style contraption barely recognisable as a model of the human body. But it wasn't at that stage intended as a simulator for training medical staff. Its sole purpose was to test the effectiveness of a novel device called a Tydeman tube. Paradoxically, although the testing equipment, Debra, is now commercially available, the device it was intended to test has yet to reach the market. 

 The inventor of the tube and of Desperate Debra is Dr Graham Tydeman, a consultant in obstetrics and gynaecology at Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife. Only after he'd built Debra did he realise that she might serve a purpose beyond his original intention. His is a decade-long tale of inspired insights, thwarted aims and shifting purposes; but with a good outcome. Although the Tydeman tube is still in gestation, Desperate Debra herself is now thriving.
To understand the desperation of Debra and how the Tydeman tube might help to relieve it requires a brief foray into basic obstetric knowhow.  Evolution has endowed us with heads proportionally so large that even when labour runs according to plan, the delivery process involves a bit of a squeeze. For the baby's head to get stuck on the way out may not be usual, but it's by no means a rarity. 

 The standard response is to perform a caesarean section. Every year some 160,000 babies are born in the UK this way, with almost two thirds of them classified as emergencies. One audit has suggested that roughly 8,000 babies get stuck and have to be delivered by caesarean at a stage when their mothers are fully dilated. ""Some of the babies will be so close to coming out by the normal route,"" says Tydeman, ""that it's then difficult to get them back up and remove them through the hole in the woman's tummy."" Which women are most at risk of this setback seems to be largely unpredictable. ""We just observe that it happens… It's been discussed in the medical literature since the 1940s, but until 10 years ago, and throughout my training and most of my life as a consultant, it wasn't really talked about.""
Considering the universality of childbirth, impaction and the best way of dealing with it are topics that seem to have gone remarkably unstudied. ""There are strong opinions about why it happens and what to do, but very little research evidence,"" says Tydeman, adding that many of these opinions are contradictory. 

 In a protracted birth that's destined to end with a caesarean, the longer the labour is allowed to go on before the obstetrician decides to intervene, the greater the likelihood that the baby's head will become impacted. However, concern over the rising number of babies born by caesarean has made doctors more wary of doing them – one consequence of which is that medical staff may allow a difficult birth to continue for longer before they resort to surgery. This could be boosting the frequency of impaction. But, again, no one is certain. 

 When obstetricians doing planned caesareans slice open a mother's womb, what they usually see is the baby's head. By slipping a hand round and below it they can easily guide the baby out. ""When you do a caesarean for an impacted baby,"" says Tydeman, ""you make the incision in the same place, but what you might come across is a shoulder because the baby's so much further down [the birth canal]."" As I'd discovered for myself, sliding a hand around the baby's head is then far more difficult. ""It makes your fingers hurt,"" says Tydeman. ""It makes your pulse rate go up to about 200, and you break out in a sweat because know you've only got about five or 10 minutes before there are serious consequences. The clock is ticking."" 

 If a baby's head is jammed down in the mother's pelvic region, common sense suggests that it might help if a second person gives a gentle backward push on the area of its head visible through the mother's dilated cervix. ""In our unit,"" says Tydeman, ""when the woman is fully dilated and you'd expect the baby to come out normally [but it doesn't]… a registrar will be asking for a push-up about one in five times."" Although registrars are doctors still in training, they're nonetheless experienced; which suggests requests for push-ups during unplanned caesareans are far from uncommon. The Tydeman tube is a gadget intended to make this manoeuvre safer and more effective.
Creativity and innovation have many unlikely sources. What seems to have inspired Tydeman to develop his device was the characteristic sound of a Wellington boot being pulled free of wet, muddy ground: a slurpy, sucking, gurgling noise. When an impacted foetal head is pulled free of the uterus it's often accompanied by a similar sucking noise, the result of air rushing in between the obstetrician's fingers to fill the space vacated. ""What occurred to me years ago was that if the air can't get in, why not put a tube up into the vagina so that it can get in from below the baby's head."" From time to time, if he felt he felt the baby might stick, Tydeman would slip a length of sterile silicone tubing through the woman's vagina and up into the womb next to the baby's head. Allowing air in by this route would release any suction forces tending to hold it where it was. 

 Tydeman didn't do much with the idea until 10 years ago when one trainee, who was experiencing real difficulty getting heads out, prompted him to think again about the problem. Around the same time, he met professor of obstetrics Andrew Shennan and consultant midwife Annette Briley, both of the Women's Health Academic Centre at St Thomas's hospital. Between them they came up with a device – the Tydeman tube – to make pushing on the foetus more controlled while simultaneously releasing any vacuum that might be holding it in place. 

 The instrument is made up of a rigid plastic tube opening into a softer silicone cup. Pressure to the foetal head is applied using four pads projecting forward from the cup's interior. Holding the device by the tube, the user places the cup against the part of the head exposed through the dilated cervix, and presses. This pushes the baby back up into the uterus while releasing any suction pressure that may have been holding it, so allowing the obstetrician to extract it more easily. Because pressure is distributed equally between the four pads with a greater combined surface area than that of a user's fingertips, the risk of inadvertent damage is minimised. 

 The team found some money to employ a product designer who used computer-aided design technology and 3D printing to make a prototype. ""We were at the point of getting one made in silicone,"" says Tydeman, ""when we realised that before we started experimenting on women we really ought to test it on a simulator."" No such simulator existed – so he decided to make one himself. 

 That Tydeman was able to do this comes as no great surprise once you've glanced at his website. His career may be rooted in medicine but his interests encompass sculpture, furniture making and much else. He works in wood, glass, metals and plastic. ""I've got a big workshop with a lathe and a forge,"" he says. ""I make stuff. I always have, ever since I was a child. My dad was a woodwork teacher, my mum was very creative with fabric.""
Although tests carried out with the Debra prototype showed that the tube would work as intended, Tydeman and his colleagues then faced what he calls a kind of medical catch-22. ""We had the tube finished about three years ago… but we were more interested in trying to save lives than selling a product. We thought that the right thing to do before commercialising it was to be sure we'd got the best design."" They tried it on a dozen or so women in labour, and concluded that it did what it supposed to. But they held off trying to market it because they wanted to do more extensive, more rigorous clinical studies.
This presented a problem. ""If you've applied for research money,"" says Tydeman, ""but you've already got what seems to be a commercially viable design, potential funders are going to say that the company aiming to sell it should pay for the work."" On the other hand, commercial interest is easier to drum up if you've already got evidence that a device is safe and effective. 

 That said, the team didn't want to leave the tube sitting on the shelf. So they eventually decided to go ahead and find a commercial partner willing to manufacture and market it. They have now identified one, and are fairly confident it will soon be in production. With sufficient users it should then be possible to compile factual – as opposed to anecdotal – evidence of benefit. Not ideal, Tydeman concedes, but the best they can do at present. 

 In the meantime, back to Desperate Debra: so named, Tydeman says, not after any particular person but because the appellation is memorably alliterative. He put together the original Debra in a weekend. The skin was made out of a neoprene wetsuit fixed to a scaffolding formed from plastic tubing he'd found 20 years ago in skip outside a Glasgow pub; the head was cast in silicone from a model he'd made in plasticine, and the rest comprised old springs and other bits of stuff lying around his workshop. ""It wasn't actually that difficult,"" Tydeman says. 

 When originally conceived, remember, Debra was simply a means of testing the effectiveness of the tube. What she looked like was neither here nor there. It was only once Debra was reborn as a teaching aid that she needed sprucing up. 

 Tydeman can remember the exact moment when the idea of her having a greater role dawned on him. ""I was on the sleeper train down from Scotland to London,"" he says. ""Debra was with me because the first Tydeman tube had become available at St Thomas's… It was about midnight, I'd had my free whisky and I suddenly thought, 'Blow me! Even if the tube doesn't work, Debra could be useful as a teaching aid'.""
The following morning, at St Thomas's, Tydeman asked a visiting professor of obstetrics to have a look at Debra and tell him what she thought. She put her hand into Debra's womb, grasped the foetal head and said it felt just like the real thing. ""Terribly flattering,"" Tydeman laughs. 

 With a grant from the Guy's and St Thomas's Charity fund they made Debra more presentable. Tydeman showed the prototype to Adam Rouilly, an established company specialising in medical models and simulators. They were impressed. A year later, the first of Debra's smartened-up sisters was on the market. 

 In Debra as she is now, the precise extent and nature of her desperation can be fine-tuned according to need. The foetal head inside her uterus can be moved to mimic the various positions that an unborn baby may adopt. By tightening a spring inside Debra's body, it's also possible vary the degree of impaction from mild to so severe that the head is virtually impossible to extract. In this way she simulates the full range of difficulty that obstetricians are likely to encounter.   

 So how valuable in training medical staff is a simulator like this? Very, according to Annette Briley. Imagine it's the middle of the night and an unplanned emergency caesarean is required: ""Some poor junior doctor might find himself trying to manage it on his own."" To have practised the knack of extracting a firmly impacted baby from a simulator is lot better than first honing your skill on a real woman. 

 At St Thomas's, midwives in training also get an opportunity to practise on Debra. The chances that midwives will find themselves having to do the actual extraction of an infant are slim; but they're quite likely to be asked to help the obstetrician by pushing a stuck baby from below. Debra's anatomy allows them to practise this skill; and to learn where and how hard to push on the infant skull. ""Any practice you've done in the cold light of day will help you stay calm and composed in an emergency, and that's what we're aiming for,"" says Briley.
It's still too soon to make a final judgement about Debra’s impact. ""When we first brought Debra out,"" Briley recalls, ""some of the really experienced professors said things like, 'We always managed without one. Why would you need this?' But ask them to have a go at using it and then they admit it's really good."" Medicine as a whole has an oddly ambivalent relationship to innovation. Some new findings, techniques or equipment take years to penetrate the profession; others are seized upon immediately. 

 A proper study of the clinical effectiveness of the Tydeman tube will necessarily involve women giving birth. Assessing the value of Debra as a simulator didn't require human subjects; and the team has already conducted such a study. Thirty obstetricians, from three NHS maternity units and with varying levels of experience, took part. They all received a brief explanation of how Debra works, and were then asked to try a timed removal of the foetal head at three different levels of difficulty. Overall, 87 per cent reported that the simulator offered a realistic experience of dealing with an impacted head, and 93 per cent thought it would be valuable as a training device. 

 The use of simulators to teach technical skills is now common in medical schools. You can learn to sew up a knife wound, catheterise a bladder or intubate an airway. You can practise cardiopulmonary resuscitation or ear syringing or even go through the motions of a keyhole surgical procedure. The technology required to do these things may cost a few pounds, or tens of thousands. Either way, given that most of these devices were invented during the past three or four decades, it comes as something of a surprise to learn that simulation for medical purposes can be traced back as far as the Chinese Song dynasty of 960-1279 AD. 

 One of the treatments of choice in that era was, naturally, acupuncture. But how to teach tyro-acupuncturists where to place the needles? Simple. A life-size bronze statue dotted with small holes indicated the points of insertion. And how then to test the students' grasp of their subject? If the statute was hollow, filled with liquid and given an outer coating of wax to mask the holes, a correct needle insertion would be followed by a leak. 

 Given the universality of childbirth it's no surprise that, then as now, the womb turns out to be the most simulated of our organs. For the benefit of 18th-century midwives and doctors-in-training, the Bologna surgeon Giovanni Antonio Galli devised a birthing simulator comprising a glass uterus supported by an artificial pelvis and containing a flexible foetus. Trainees had to deliver the baby while wearing a blindfold. Only the tutor could witness the fumbling of their hands. 

 As the material for a convincing simulation, glass clearly has its drawbacks. But another 18th-century contraption used a pink cloth-covered mannequin comprising a female torso complete with genitalia, a set of implantable foetuses of various ages, and even – a real
coup de théâtre
, this – a facility for exuding suitably coloured liquids at the appropriate moment.
Oddly, as medicine became more scientific, most of these devices fell by the wayside. As an academic review of these and other devices has pointed out, much of the 20th century was something of Dark Ages for simulation. Its value in professional training has had to be rediscovered: an endeavour in which inventive people like Graham Tydeman, sometimes with workshops rich in discarded junk, are still fruitfully engaged.

This, be it understood, is fiction—nothing but fiction—and not,
 under any circumstances, to be considered as having any truth
 whatever to it. It's obviously utterly impossible ... isn't it?
An interview with Dr. I. M. Niemand, Director of the Psychophysical
 Institute of Solar and Terrestrial Relations, Camarillo, California.
In the closing days of December, 1957, at the meeting of the American
 Association for the Advancement of Science in New York, Dr. Niemand
 delivered a paper entitled simply, ""On the Nature of the Solar
 S-Regions."" Owing to its unassuming title the startling implications
 contained in the paper were completely overlooked by the press. These
 implications are discussed here in an exclusive interview with Dr.
 Niemand by Philip Latham.
LATHAM. Dr. Niemand, what would you say is your main job?


 NIEMAND. I suppose you might say my main job today is to find out all I
 can between activity on the Sun and various forms of activity on the
 Earth.


 LATHAM. What do you mean by activity on the Sun?


 NIEMAND. Well, a sunspot is a form of solar activity.


 LATHAM. Just what is a sunspot?


 NIEMAND. I'm afraid I can't say just what a sunspot is. I can only
 describe it. A sunspot is a region on the Sun that is cooler than its
 surroundings. That's why it looks dark. It isn't so hot. Therefore not
 so bright.


 LATHAM. Isn't it true that the number of spots on the Sun rises and
 falls in a cycle of eleven years?


 NIEMAND. The number of spots on the Sun rises and falls in a cycle of
about
eleven years. That word
about
makes quite a difference.


 LATHAM. In what way?


 NIEMAND. It means you can only approximately predict the future course
 of sunspot activity. Sunspots are mighty treacherous things.


 LATHAM. Haven't there been a great many correlations announced between
 sunspots and various effects on the Earth?


 NIEMAND. Scores of them.


 LATHAM. What is your opinion of these correlations?


 NIEMAND. Pure bosh in most cases.


 LATHAM. But some are valid?


 NIEMAND. A few. There is unquestionably a correlation between
 sunspots and disturbances of the Earth's magnetic field ... radio
 fade-outs ... auroras ... things like that.


 LATHAM. Now, Dr. Niemand, I understand that you have been investigating
 solar and terrestrial relationships along rather unorthodox lines.


 NIEMAND. Yes, I suppose some people would say so.


 LATHAM. You have broken new ground?


 NIEMAND. That's true.


 LATHAM. In what way have your investigations differed from those of
 others?


 NIEMAND. I think our biggest advance was the discovery that sunspots
 themselves are not the direct cause of the disturbances we have been
 studying on the Earth. It's something like the eruptions in rubeola.
 Attention is concentrated on the bright red papules because they're such
 a conspicuous symptom of the disease. Whereas the real cause is an
 invisible filterable virus. In the solar case it turned out to be these
 S-Regions.


 LATHAM. Why S-Regions?


 NIEMAND. We had to call them something. Named after the Sun, I suppose.


 LATHAM. You say an S-Region is invisible?


 NIEMAND. It is quite invisible to the eye but readily detected by
 suitable instrumental methods. It is extremely doubtful, however, if the
 radiation we detect is the actual cause of the disturbing effects
 observed.


 LATHAM. Just what are these effects?


 NIEMAND. Well, they're common enough, goodness knows. As old as the
 world, in fact. Yet strangely enough it's hard to describe them in exact
 terms.


 LATHAM. Can you give us a general idea?


 NIEMAND. I'll try. Let's see ... remember that speech from ""Julius
 Caesar"" where Cassius is bewailing the evil times that beset ancient
 Rome? I believe it went like this: ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in
 our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings.""


 LATHAM. I'm afraid I don't see—


 NIEMAND. Well, Shakespeare would have been nearer the truth if he had
 put it the other way around. ""The fault, dear Brutus, is not in
 ourselves but in our stars"" or better ""in the Sun.""
LATHAM. In the Sun?


 NIEMAND. That's right, in the Sun. I suppose the oldest problem in the
 world is the origin of human evil. Philosophers have wrestled with it
 ever since the days of Job. And like Job they have usually given up in
 despair, convinced that the origin of evil is too deep for the human
 mind to solve. Generally they have concluded that man is inherently
 wicked and sinful and that is the end of it. Now for the first time
 science has thrown new light on this subject.


 LATHAM. How is that?


 NIEMAND. Consider the record of history. There are occasional periods
 when conditions are fairly calm and peaceful. Art and industry
 flourished. Man at last seemed to be making progress toward some higher
 goal. Then suddenly—
for no detectable reason
—conditions are
 reversed. Wars rage. People go mad. The world is plunged into an orgy of
 bloodshed and misery.


 LATHAM. But weren't there reasons?


 NIEMAND. What reasons?


 LATHAM. Well, disputes over boundaries ... economic rivalry ... border
 incidents....


 NIEMAND. Nonsense. Men always make some flimsy excuse for going to war.
 The truth of the matter is that men go to war because they want to go
 to war. They can't help themselves. They are impelled by forces over
 which they have no control. By forces outside of themselves.


 LATHAM. Those are broad, sweeping statements. Can't you be more
 specific?


 NIEMAND. Perhaps I'd better go back to the beginning. Let me see.... It
 all started back in March, 1955, when I started getting patients
 suffering from a complex of symptoms, such as profound mental
 depression, anxiety, insomnia, alternating with fits of violent rage and
 resentment against life and the world in general. These people were
 deeply disturbed. No doubt about that. Yet they were not psychotic and
 hardly more than mildly neurotic. Now every doctor gets a good many
 patients of this type. Such a syndrome is characteristic of menopausal
 women and some men during the climacteric, but these people failed to
 fit into this picture. They were married and single persons of both
 sexes and of all ages. They came from all walks of life. The onset of
 their attack was invariably sudden and with scarcely any warning. They
 would be going about their work feeling perfectly all right. Then in a
 minute the whole world was like some scene from a nightmare. A week or
 ten days later the attack would cease as mysteriously as it had come and
 they would be their old self again.


 LATHAM. Aren't such attacks characteristic of the stress and strain of
 modern life?


 NIEMAND. I'm afraid that old stress-and-strain theory has been badly
 overworked. Been hearing about it ever since I was a pre-med student at
 ucla
 . Even as a boy I can remember my grandfather deploring the stress
 and strain of modern life when he was a country doctor practicing in
 Indiana. In my opinion one of the most valuable contributions
 anthropologists have made in recent years is the discovery that
 primitive man is afflicted with essentially the same neurotic conditions
 as those of us who live a so-called civilized life. They have found
 savages displaying every symptom of a nervous breakdown among the
 mountain tribes of the Elgonyi and the Aruntas of Australia. No, Mr.
 Latham, it's time the stress-and-strain theory was relegated to the junk
 pile along with demoniac possession and blood letting.


 LATHAM. You must have done something for your patients—


 NIEMAND. A doctor must always do something for the patients who come to
 his office seeking help. First I gave them a thorough physical
 examination. I turned up some minor ailments—a slight heart murmur or a
 trace of albumin in the urine—but nothing of any significance. On the
 whole they were a remarkably healthy bunch of individuals, much more so
 than an average sample of the population. Then I made a searching
 inquiry into their personal life. Here again I drew a blank. They had no
 particular financial worries. Their sex life was generally satisfactory.
 There was no history of mental illness in the family. In fact, the only
 thing that seemed to be the matter with them was that there were times
 when they felt like hell.


 LATHAM. I suppose you tried tranquilizers?


 NIEMAND. Oh, yes. In a few cases in which I tried tranquilizing pills of
 the meprobamate type there was some slight improvement. I want to
 emphasize, however, that I do not believe in prescribing shotgun
 remedies for a patient. To my way of thinking it is a lazy slipshod way
 of carrying on the practice of medicine. The only thing for which I do
 give myself credit was that I asked my patients to keep a detailed
 record of their symptoms taking special care to note the time of
 exacerbation—increase in the severity of the symptoms—as accurately as
 possible.


 LATHAM. And this gave you a clue?


 NIEMAND. It was the beginning. In most instances patients reported the
 attack struck with almost the impact of a physical blow. The prodromal
 symptoms were usually slight ... a sudden feeling of uneasiness and
 guilt ... hot and cold flashes ... dizziness ... double vision. Then
 this ghastly sense of depression coupled with a blind insensate rage at
 life. One man said he felt as if the world were closing in on him.
 Another that he felt the people around him were plotting his
 destruction. One housewife made her husband lock her in her room for
 fear she would injure the children. I pored over these case histories
 for a long time getting absolutely nowhere. Then finally a pattern began
 to emerge.
LATHAM. What sort of pattern?


 NIEMAND. The first thing that struck me was that the attacks all
 occurred during the daytime, between the hours of about seven in the
 morning and five in the evening. Then there were these coincidences—


 LATHAM. Coincidences?


 NIEMAND. Total strangers miles apart were stricken at almost the same
 moment. At first I thought nothing of it but as my records accumulated I
 became convinced it could not be attributed to chance. A mathematical
 analysis showed the number of coincidences followed a Poisson
 distribution very closely. I couldn't possibly see what daylight had to
 do with it. There is some evidence that mental patients are most
 disturbed around the time of full moon, but a search of medical
 literature failed to reveal any connection with the Sun.


 LATHAM. What did you do?


 NIEMAND. Naturally I said nothing of this to my patients. I did,
 however, take pains to impress upon them the necessity of keeping an
 exact record of the onset of an attack. The better records they kept the
 more conclusive was the evidence. Men and women were experiencing nearly
 simultaneous attacks of rage and depression all over southern
 California, which was as far as my practice extended. One day it
 occurred to me: if people a few miles apart could be stricken
 simultaneously, why not people hundreds or thousands of miles apart? It
 was this idea that prompted me to get in touch with an old colleague of
 mine I had known at UC medical school, Dr. Max Hillyard, who was in
 practice in Utica, New York.


 LATHAM. With what result?


 NIEMAND. I was afraid the result would be that my old roommate would
 think I had gone completely crazy. Imagine my surprise and gratification
 on receiving an answer by return mail to the effect that he also had
 been getting an increasing number of patients suffering with the same
 identical symptoms as my own. Furthermore, upon exchanging records we
did
find that in many cases patients three thousand miles apart had
 been stricken simultaneously—


 LATHAM. Just a minute. I would like to know how you define
 ""simultaneous.""


 NIEMAND. We say an attack is simultaneous when one occurred on the east
 coast, for example, not earlier or later than five minutes of an attack
 on the west coast. That is about as close as you can hope to time a
 subjective effect of this nature. And now another fact emerged which
 gave us another clue.


 LATHAM. Which was?


 NIEMAND. In every case of a simultaneous attack the Sun was shining at
 both New York and California.


 LATHAM. You mean if it was cloudy—


 NIEMAND. No, no. The weather had nothing to do with it. I mean the Sun
 had to be above the horizon at both places. A person might undergo an
 attack soon after sunrise in New York but there would be no
 corresponding record of an attack in California where it was still dark.
 Conversely, a person might be stricken late in the afternoon in
 California without a corresponding attack in New York where the Sun had
 set. Dr. Hillyard and I had been searching desperately for a clue. We
 had both noticed that the attacks occurred only during the daylight
 hours but this had not seemed especially significant. Here we had
 evidence pointing directly to the source of trouble. It must have some
 connection with the Sun.


 LATHAM. That must have had you badly puzzled at first.


 NIEMAND. It certainly did. It looked as if we were headed back to the
 Middle Ages when astrology and medicine went hand in hand. But since it
 was our only lead we had no other choice but to follow it regardless of
 the consequences. Here luck played somewhat of a part, for Hillyard
 happened to have a contact that proved invaluable to us. Several years
 before Hillyard had gotten to know a young astrophysicist, Henry
 Middletown, who had come to him suffering from a severe case of myositis
 in the arms and shoulders. Hillyard had been able to effect a complete
 cure for which the boy was very grateful, and they had kept up a
 desultory correspondence. Middletown was now specializing in radio
 astronomy at the government's new solar observatory on Turtle Back
 Mountain in Arizona. If it had not been for Middletown's help I'm afraid
 our investigation would never have gotten past the clinical stage.


 LATHAM. In what way was Middletown of assistance?


 NIEMAND. It was the old case of workers in one field of science being
 completely ignorant of what was going on in another field. Someday we
 will have to establish a clearing house in science instead of keeping it
 in tight little compartments as we do at present. Well, Hillyard and I
 packed up for Arizona with considerable misgivings. We were afraid
 Middletown wouldn't take our findings seriously but somewhat to our
 surprise he heard our story with the closest attention. I guess
 astronomers have gotten so used to hearing from flying saucer
 enthusiasts and science-fiction addicts that nothing surprises them any
 more. When we had finished he asked to see our records. Hillyard had
 them all set down for easy numerical tabulation. Middletown went to work
 with scarcely a word. Within an hour he had produced a chart that was
 simply astounding.
LATHAM. Can you describe this chart for us?


 NIEMAND. It was really quite simple. But if it had not been for
 Middletown's experience in charting other solar phenomena it would never
 have occurred to us to do it. First, he laid out a series of about
 thirty squares horizontally across a sheet of graph paper. He dated
 these beginning March 1, 1955, when our records began. In each square he
 put a number from 1 to 10 that was a rough index of the number and
 intensity of the attacks reported on that day. Then he laid out another
 horizontal row below the first one dated twenty-seven days later. That
 is, the square under March 1st in the top row was dated March 28th in
 the row below it. He filled in the chart until he had an array of dozens
 of rows that included all our data down to May, 1958.


 When Middletown had finished it was easy to see that the squares of
 highest index number did not fall at random on the chart. Instead they
 fell in slightly slanting parallel series so that you could draw
 straight lines down through them. The connection with the Sun was
 obvious.


 LATHAM. In what way?


 NIEMAND. Why, because twenty-seven days is about the synodic period of
 solar rotation. That is, if you see a large spot at the center of the
 Sun's disk today, there is a good chance if it survives that you will
 see it at the same place twenty-seven days later. But that night
 Middletown produced another chart that showed the connection with the
 Sun in a way that was even more convincing.


 LATHAM. How was that?


 NIEMAND. I said that the lines drawn down through the days of greatest
 mental disturbance slanted slightly. On this second chart the squares
 were dated under one another not at intervals of twenty-seven days, but
 at intervals of twenty-seven point three days.


 LATHAM. Why is that so important?


 NIEMAND. Because the average period of solar rotation in the sunspot
 zone is not twenty-seven days but twenty-seven point three days. And on
 this chart the lines did not slant but went vertically downward. The
 correlation with the synodic rotation of the Sun was practically
 perfect.


 LATHAM. But how did you get onto the S-Regions?


 NIEMAND. Middletown was immediately struck by the resemblance between
 the chart of mental disturbance and one he had been plotting over the
 years from his radio observations. Now when he compared the two charts
 the resemblance between the two was unmistakable. The pattern shown by
 the chart of mental disturbance corresponded in a striking way with the
 solar chart but with this difference. The disturbances on the Earth
 started two days later on the average than the disturbances due to the
 S-Regions on the Sun. In other words, there was a lag of about
 forty-eight hours between the two. But otherwise they were almost
 identical.


 LATHAM. But if these S-Regions of Middletown's are invisible how could
 he detect them?


 NIEMAND. The S-Regions are invisible to the eye through an
optical
telescope, but are detected with ease by a
radio
telescope. Middletown
 had discovered them when he was a graduate student working on radio
 astronomy in Australia, and he had followed up his researches with the
 more powerful equipment at Turtle Back Mountain. The formation of an
 S-Region is heralded by a long series of bursts of a few seconds
 duration, when the radiation may increase up to several thousand times
 that of the background intensity. These noise storms have been recorded
 simultaneously on wavelengths of from one to fifteen meters, which so
 far is the upper limit of the observations. In a few instances, however,
 intense bursts have also been detected down to fifty cm.


 LATHAM. I believe you said the periods of mental disturbance last for
 about ten or twelve days. How does that tie-in with the S-Regions?


 NIEMAND. Very closely. You see it takes about twelve days for an
 S-Region to pass across the face of the Sun, since the synodic rotation
 is twenty-seven point three days.


 LATHAM. I should think it would be nearer thirteen or fourteen days.


 NIEMAND. Apparently an S-Region is not particularly effective when it is
 just coming on or just going off the disk of the Sun.


 LATHAM. Are the S-Regions associated with sunspots?


 NIEMAND. They are connected in this way: that sunspot activity and
 S-Region activity certainly go together. The more sunspots the more
 violent and intense is the S-Region activity. But there is not a
 one-to-one correspondence between sunspots and S-Regions. That is, you
 cannot connect a particular sunspot group with a particular S-Region.
 The same thing is true of sunspots and magnetic storms.


 LATHAM. How do you account for this?


 NIEMAND. We don't account for it.
LATHAM. What other properties of the S-Regions have you discovered?


 NIEMAND. Middletown says that the radio waves emanating from them are
 strongly circularly polarized. Moreover, the sense of rotation remains
 constant while one is passing across the Sun. If the magnetic field
 associated with an S-Region extends into the high solar corona through
 which the rays pass, then the sense of rotation corresponds to the
 ordinary ray of the magneto-ionic theory.


 LATHAM. Does this mean that the mental disturbances arise from some form
 of electromagnetic radiation?


 NIEMAND. We doubt it. As I said before, the charts show a lag of about
 forty-eight hours between the development of an S-Region and the onset
 of mental disturbance. This indicates that the malignant energy
 emanating from an S-Region consists of some highly penetrating form of
 corpuscular radiation, as yet unidentified.
 [A]


 LATHAM. A question that puzzles me is why some people are affected by
 the S-Regions while others are not.


 NIEMAND. Our latest results indicate that probably
no one
is
 completely immune. All are affected in
some
degree. Just why some
 should be affected so much more than others is still a matter of
 speculation.


 LATHAM. How long does an S-Region last?


 NIEMAND. An S-Region may have a lifetime of from three to perhaps a
 dozen solar rotations. Then it dies out and for a time we are free from
 this malignant radiation. Then a new region develops in perhaps an
 entirely different region of the Sun. Sometimes there may be several
 different S-Regions all going at once.


 LATHAM. Why were not the S-Regions discovered long ago?


 NIEMAND. Because the radio exploration of the Sun only began since the
 end of World War II.


 LATHAM. How does it happen that you only got patients suffering from
 S-radiation since about 1955?


 NIEMAND. I think we did get such patients previously but not in large
 enough numbers to attract attention. Also the present sunspot cycle
 started its rise to maximum about 1954.


 LATHAM. Is there no way of escaping the S-radiation?


 NIEMAND. I'm afraid the only sure way is to keep on the unilluminated
 side of the Earth which is rather difficult to do. Apparently the
 corpuscular beam from an S-Region is several degrees wide and not very
 sharply defined, since its effects are felt simultaneously over the
 entire continent. Hillyard and Middletown are working on some form of
 shielding device but so far without success.


 LATHAM. What is the present state of S-Region activity?


 NIEMAND. At the present moment there happens to be no S-Region activity
 on the Sun. But a new one may develop at any time. Also, the outlook for
 a decrease in activity is not very favorable. Sunspot activity continues
 at a high level and is steadily mounting in violence. The last sunspot
 cycle had the highest maximum of any since 1780, but the present cycle
 bids fair to set an all time record.


 LATHAM. And so you believe that the S-Regions are the cause of most of
 the present trouble in the world. That it is not ourselves but something
 outside ourselves—


 NIEMAND. That is the logical outcome of our investigation. We are
 controlled and swayed by forces which in many cases we are powerless to
 resist.


 LATHAM. Could we not be warned of the presence of an S-Region?


 NIEMAND. The trouble is they seem to develop at random on the Sun. I'm
 afraid any warning system would be worse than useless. We would be
 crying WOLF! all the time.


 LATHAM. How may a person who is not particularly susceptible to this
 malignant radiation know that one of these regions is active?


 NIEMAND. If you have a feeling of restlessness and anxiety, if you are
 unable to concentrate, if you feel suddenly depressed and discouraged
 about yourself, or are filled with resentment toward the world, then you
 may be pretty sure that an S-Region is passing across the face of the
 Sun. Keep a tight rein on yourself. For it seems that evil will always
 be with us ... as long as the Sun shall continue to shine upon this
 little world.
THE END

 Middletown believes that the Intense radiation recently
 discovered from information derived from Explorer I and III has no
 connection with the corpuscular S-radiation.

Slate,"eBabe 

         This week, soft-porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion models on the Internet. His site, ronsangels.com (named after the 1970s' babe show Charlie's Angels ), invites visitors to ""bid on eggs from beautiful, healthy and intelligent women."" Like Dr. Richard Seed, who recently declared his intention to clone human beings, Harris has attracted the attention of the media and politicians who are ""looking into"" whether he can be stopped. Most people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage. What they don't agree on is why. Here's what the critics have to say about the auction--and each other. 

          

            1. Egg auctions will produce designer babies. Harris cites his experience as a horse breeder and asks, ""We bid for everything else in this society--why not eggs?"" Alarmists, agreeing that Harris ""can put you into your own designer baby by selling eggs,"" predict that his success will steer ""the future of human breeding"" toward ""genetic engineering."" 

          

            2. Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies. While fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds, fertility experts simultaneously debunk that scenario. ""Not only is it ethically ludicrous, but the fact is, no kid's going to look like the model's picture,"" observes ethicist George Annas. The experts give four reasons. First, the child of an ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty. Second, everyone carries ""recessive"" genes, which are invisible in this generation but may become visible in the next. A model with a small nose can pass on genes for a big nose. Third, even if both parents are attractive, a child can combine their features unattractively. For example, a girl can inherit her mother's weak nose and her father's strong brow. 

          

            3. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest. Doomsayers predict that once ""beautiful eggs are available strictly to people who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them,"" the rich will transform themselves into a ""super-race"" reminiscent of the Nazis. To this, Harris replies, ""It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of only beautiful people. This site simply mirrors our current society, in that beauty usually goes to the highest bidder."" But this reply only fuels concern that gradually, society will separate into ""genetic haves and have nots."" 

          

            4. Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest. Harris writes that only men with ""substantial financial resources"" are fit to give his models' offspring ""a financially secure and stable life."" But skeptics wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder--and men who buy these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good-looking children--may produce children just as dysfunctional as themselves. As Calgary Sun columnist Sydney Sharpe put it, ""Any woman ... who enters into this mephistophelian pact has a few screws loose. Maybe her kid will, too. Not to mention the buyers who sign her up."" 

          

            5. Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the unfittest. Many models, if not most, have had cosmetic surgery. A model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs. (One of Harris' ""angels"" has already been caught lying about her age.) How does Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs? ""There's no way to know that. You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the truth,"" he says. Annas concludes that since there's ""no way to know how much of their beauty is a product of their genes, plastic surgery, a makeup artist, or exercise,"" only a ""naive"" person would buy their eggs on the basis of the photographs displayed on the site. ""You don't want to see the models,"" he points out. ""You want to see pictures of their parents."" On this theory, children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on one side and fools on the other. 

          

            6. Beauty doesn't convey health. Harris casually asserts that beauty ""shows healthiness and longevity."" On his site, he writes, "" 'Natural Selection' is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful."" Skeptics question this assumed equivalence, noting that traits men find attractive in women these days--thinness, for example--are often unhealthy. When asked on the Today show how much ""medical screening"" he has given his egg donors, Harris answered, ""None."" 

          

            7. Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence. Harris says he's not the first person to market good genes. Others, he notes, have sold sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor's intelligence. Harris' detractors reply that beauty is ""superficial"" and conveys a ""harmful preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of character."" This critique is usually offered by a blow-dried TV interviewer who, after thanking Harris for his time, urges viewers to stay tuned for the movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break. 

          

            8. Beauty is less useful than intelligence. Harris advertises beauty not as an end but as a means to ""success,"" since people who are physically desirable get more attention, power, and favorable treatment. Having chided Harris for exalting social advantage over ""character,"" critics turn around and adopt his ruthless logic. While conceding that beauty is useful, they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today's meritocratic information economy--and that although Harris claims his models are ""beautiful, healthy and intelligent,"" he offers no evidence of brains, such as IQ or SAT scores. London's Independent envisions ""Bimbo births."" A fertility expert shrugs, ""If people want to spend $150,000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68, let them."" 

          

            9. The auction exploits desperate buyers. Harris preaches pure capitalism, saying it's ""unfair to put a limit on a girl's ability to make money"" by auctioning her eggs. In turn, fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of ""taking advantage of couples trying to conceive"" and exploiting ""desperate people ... susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell."" USA Today laments, ""This is about human need. And human greed."" 

          

            10. The auction exploits desperate sellers. By late Monday, Harris had only a handful of bids, and only one was verified as legitimate. On the other hand, 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction. Gradually, the media concluded that the donors were the true victims. USA Today described the models as ""struggling actresses,"" reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs, and quoted one as saying, ""I'd rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse ."" Harris' sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was ""better than prostitution."" 

         Harris constantly refers to the donors as his ""girls"" and describes them like cattle--""We have a legitimate bid of $42,000 on one of the girls."" He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid, though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures. ""We have no control over the quality, safety or legality of the items advertised, the truth or accuracy of the listings, the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items,"" he stipulates. His role, he explains, is simply to ""find beautiful girls, take beautiful photographs of them, [and] put them up on the Web."" To some critics, the mystery isn't, as Harris suggests, how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men, but how pimps like him have come away with the profit. 

          

            11. The auction exploits voyeurs. The Washington Post thinks Harris isn't targeting either buyers or sellers. He's not serious about selling eggs, says the Post . He's just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site, from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions ($24.95 a month to view profiles of the models), hawk his forthcoming book ( Naked Power ), and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites. A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels.com is really aimed at ""adolescent boys."" 

          

            12. The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases. Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam (a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment), the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together (which turned out to be a hoax), and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month. ""Ever since the Internet, it seems to snowball more rapidly, this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs,"" one fertility expert complains to the New York Times . USA Today says the egg auction ""just might force an Internet-obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself: Where is the Internet taking us?"" 

          

            13. The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases. The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet, according to the critics, is not getting the eggs you paid for. ""When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet, there may be fraud,"" a computer crime expert warns USA Today . Lori Andrews, a reproductive technology lawyer, warns CNN viewers that ""there's very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected,"" and ""the Internet just adds ... a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from."" 

          

            14. Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences. Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris' application of Darwin's theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology. To begin with, if a child produced by Harris' auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected, the buyer may shun the child, or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents. (On the Today show, Harris said of this theory, ""That's a pretty cynical view of human nature."") Second, if the child turns out pretty but doesn't want to be a beauty queen, her parents may force her in that direction anyway, thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful. Third, the child's good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind, eventually destroying her. Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples. 

          

            15. Other people's eggs don't pass on your genes. In defense of his auction, Harris quotes author Helen Fisher's statement that ""having sex is the most important act of your life. This is how we get our genes to the next generation."" But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words: ""our genes."" ""The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the [drive] to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site,"" Fisher observes. This consideration may not affect single men, but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples. On this view, Harris' mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness, but that he neglects it. He forgets that you don't care about reproducing unless what you're reproducing is yourself. 

          

            16. The power of beauty should be transcended, not exploited. Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it's human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at, and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they're attractive. The most ambitious response is to attack the whole ""prejudice"" in favor of beauty. ""The standards of beauty do vary with the culture. And they are social facts, not really genetics facts,"" says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings. Therefore, ""we should think about"" whether to ""accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them"" or to transcend those prejudices. 

         This critique challenges two precepts of Harris' worldview. First, while pretending to accept human nature as a given, he violates it by peddling strangers' eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers. Family association, loyalty, and love are among the best parts of human nature. Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst. If we're going to challenge human nature, the critics ask, why not start with the latter rather than the former? 

         Second, Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection. ""Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state,"" he writes. What he doesn't seem to understand is that human beings aren't quite like other animals, just as the rest of the world isn't exactly like the modeling and soft-porn industries of Southern California. Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue, perfection, and success have become more than material. At least, most of us have.

By ARNOLD CASTLE
ILLUSTRATED by SUMMERS
Is there something wrong with you?
 Do you fail to fit in with your group?
 Nervous, anxious, ill-at-ease? Happy
 about it? Lucky you!
Frank Pembroke
 sat behind
 the desk of his shabby
 little office over Lemark's Liquors
 in downtown Los Angeles and
 waited for his first customer. He
 had been in business for a week
 and as yet had had no callers.
 Therefore, it was with a mingled
 sense of excitement and satisfaction
 that he greeted the tall,
 dark, smooth-faced figure that
 came up the stairs and into the
 office shortly before noon.


 ""Good day, sir,"" said Pembroke
 with an amiable smile. ""I
 see my advertisement has interested
 you. Please stand in that
 corner for just a moment.""


 Opening the desk drawer,
 which was almost empty, Pembroke
 removed an automatic pistol
 fitted with a silencer. Pointing
 it at the amazed customer, he
 fired four .22 caliber longs into
 the narrow chest. Then he made
 a telephone call and sat down to
 wait. He wondered how long it
 would be before his next client
 would arrive.
The series of events leading up
 to Pembroke's present occupation
 had commenced on a dismal,
 overcast evening in the South
 Pacific a year earlier. Bound for
 Sydney, two days out of Valparaiso,
 the Colombian tramp
 steamer
Elena Mia
had encountered
 a dense greenish fog which
 seemed vaguely redolent of citrus
 trees. Standing on the forward
 deck, Pembroke was one of the
 first to perceive the peculiar odor
 and to spot the immense gray
 hulk wallowing in the murky distance.


 Then the explosion had come,
 from far below the waterline,
 and the decks were awash with
 frantic crewmen, officers, and the
 handful of passengers. Only two
 lifeboats were launched before
 the
Elena Mia
went down. Pembroke
 was in the second. The
 roar of the sinking ship was the
 last thing he heard for some
 time.


 Pembroke came as close to being
 a professional adventurer as
 one can in these days of regimented
 travel, organized peril,
 and political restriction. He had
 made for himself a substantial
 fortune through speculation in a
 great variety of properties, real
 and otherwise. Life had given
 him much and demanded little,
 which was perhaps the reason
 for his restiveness.
Loyalty to person or to people
 was a trait Pembroke had never
 recognized in himself, nor had it
 ever been expected of him. And
 yet he greatly envied those
 staunch patriots and lovers who
 could find it in themselves to
 elevate the glory and safety of
 others above that of themselves.


 Lacking such loyalties, Pembroke
 adapted quickly to the situation
 in which he found himself
 when he regained consciousness.
 He awoke in a small room in
 what appeared to be a typical
 modern American hotel. The wallet
 in his pocket contained exactly
 what it should, approximately
 three hundred dollars.
 His next thought was of food.
 He left the room and descended
 via the elevator to the restaurant.
 Here he observed that it
 was early afternoon. Ordering
 a full dinner, for he was unusually
 hungry, he began to study the
 others in the restaurant.


 Many of the faces seemed familiar;
 the crew of the ship,
 probably. He also recognized several
 of the passengers. However,
 he made no attempt to speak to
 them. After his meal, he bought
 a good corona and went for a
 walk. His situation could have
 been any small western American
 seacoast city. He heard the hiss
 of the ocean in the direction the
 afternoon sun was taking. In his
 full-gaited walk, he was soon approaching
 the beach.


 On the sand he saw a number
 of sun bathers. One in particular,
 an attractive woman of about
 thirty, tossed back her long,
 chestnut locks and gazed up intently
 at Pembroke as he passed.
 Seldom had he enjoyed so ingenuous
 an invitation. He halted
 and stared down at her for a few
 moments.


 ""You are looking for someone?""
 she inquired.


 ""Much of the time,"" said the
 man.


 ""Could it be me?""


 ""It could be.""


 ""Yet you seem unsure,"" she
 said.


 Pembroke smiled, uneasily.
 There was something not entirely
 normal about her conversation.
 Though the rest of her compensated
 for that.


 ""Tell me what's wrong with
 me,"" she went on urgently. ""I'm
 not good enough, am I? I mean,
 there's something wrong with
 the way I look or act. Isn't there?
 Please help me, please!""


 ""You're not casual enough, for
 one thing,"" said Pembroke, deciding
 to play along with her for
 the moment. ""You're too tense.
 Also you're a bit knock-kneed,
 not that it matters. Is that what
 you wanted to hear?""


 ""Yes, yes—I mean, I suppose
 so. I can try to be more casual.
 But I don't know what to do
 about my knees,"" she said wistfully,
 staring across at the
 smooth, tan limbs. ""Do you think
 I'm okay otherwise? I mean, as a
 whole I'm not so bad, am I? Oh,
 please tell me.""


 ""How about talking it over at
 supper tonight?"" Pembroke proposed.
 ""Maybe with less distraction
 I'll have a better picture of
 you—as a whole.""


 ""Oh, that's very generous of
 you,"" the woman told him. She
 scribbled a name and an address
 on a small piece of paper and
 handed it to him. ""Any time
 after six,"" she said.


 Pembroke left the beach and
 walked through several small
 specialty shops. He tried to get
 the woman off his mind, but the
 oddness of her conversation continued
 to bother him. She was
 right about being different, but
 it was her concern about being
 different that made her so. How
 to explain
that
to her?
Then he saw the weird little
 glass statuette among the usual
 bric-a-brac. It rather resembled
 a ground hog, had seven fingers
 on each of its six limbs, and
 smiled up at him as he stared.


 ""Can I help you, sir?"" a middle-aged
 saleswoman inquired.
 ""Oh, good heavens, whatever is
 that thing doing here?""


 Pembroke watched with lifted
 eyebrows as the clerk whisked
 the bizarre statuette underneath
 the counter.


 ""What the hell was that?""
 Pembroke demanded.


 ""Oh, you know—or don't you?
 Oh, my,"" she concluded, ""are you
 one of the—strangers?""


 ""And if I were?""


 ""Well, I'd certainly appreciate
 it if you'd tell me how I walk.""
She came around in front of
 the counter and strutted back
 and forth a few times.


 ""They tell me I lean too far
 forward,"" she confided. ""But I
 should think you'd fall down if
 you didn't.""


 ""Don't try to go so fast and
 you won't fall down,"" suggested
 Pembroke. ""You're in too much
 of a hurry. Also those fake flowers
 on your blouse make you look
 frumpy.""


 ""Well, I'm supposed to look
 frumpy,"" the woman retorted.
 ""That's the type of person I am.
 But you can look frumpy and still
 walk natural, can't you? Everyone
 says you can.""


 ""Well, they've got a point,""
 said Pembroke. ""Incidentally,
 just where are we, anyway?
 What city is this?""


 ""Puerto Pacifico,"" she told
 him. ""Isn't that a lovely name?
 It means peaceful port. In Spanish.""


 That was fine. At least he now
 knew where he was. But as he
 left the shop he began checking
 off every west coast state, city,
 town, and inlet. None, to the best
 of his knowledge, was called
 Puerto Pacifico.


 He headed for the nearest
 service station and asked for a
 map. The attendant gave him one
 which showed the city, but nothing
 beyond.


 ""Which way is it to San Francisco?""
 asked Pembroke.


 ""That all depends on where
 you are,"" the boy returned.


 ""Okay, then where am I?""


 ""Pardon me, there's a customer,""
 the boy said. ""This is
 Puerto Pacifico.""


 Pembroke watched him hurry
 off to service a car with a sense
 of having been given the runaround.
 To his surprise, the boy
 came back a few minutes later
 after servicing the automobile.


 ""Say, I've just figured out who
 you are,"" the youngster told him.
 ""I'd sure appreciate it if you'd
 give me a little help on my lingo.
 Also, you gas up the car first,
 then try to sell 'em the oil—right?""


 ""Right,"" said Pembroke wearily.
 ""What's wrong with your
 lingo? Other than the fact that
 it's not colloquial enough.""


 ""Not enough slang, huh? Well,
 I guess I'll have to concentrate
 on that. How about the smile?""


 ""Perfect,"" Pembroke told him.


 ""Yeah?"" said the boy delightedly.
 ""Say, come back again,
 huh? I sure appreciate the help.
 Keep the map.""


 ""Thanks. One more thing,""
 Pembroke said. ""What's over
 that way—outside the city?""


 ""Sand.""


 ""How about that way?"" he
 asked, pointing north. ""And that
 way?"" pointing south.


 ""More of the same.""


 ""Any railroads?""


 ""That we ain't got.""


 ""Buses? Airlines?""


 The kid shook his head.


 ""Some city.""


 ""Yeah, it's kinda isolated. A
 lot of ships dock here, though.""


 ""All cargo ships, I'll bet. No
 passengers,"" said Pembroke.


 ""Right,"" said the attendant,
 giving with his perfect smile.


 ""No getting out of here, is
 there?""


 ""That's for sure,"" the boy said,
 walking away to wait on another
 customer. ""If you don't like the
 place, you've had it.""
Pembroke returned to the
 hotel. Going to the bar, he recognized
 one of the
Elena Mia's
paying
 passengers. He was a short,
 rectangular little man in his fifties
 named Spencer. He sat in a
 booth with three young women,
 all lovely, all effusive. The topic
 of the conversation turned out
 to be precisely what Pembroke
 had predicted.


 ""Well, Louisa, I'd say your
 only fault is the way you keep
 wigglin' your shoulders up 'n'
 down. Why'n'sha try holdin' 'em
 straight?""


 ""I thought it made me look
 sexy,"" the redhead said petulantly.


 ""Just be yourself, gal,"" Spencer
 drawled, jabbing her intimately
 with a fat elbow, ""and
 you'll qualify.""


 ""Me, me,"" the blonde with a
 feather cut was insisting. ""What
 is wrong with me?""


 ""You're perfect, sweetheart,""
 he told her, taking her hand.


 ""Ah, come on,"" she pleaded.
 ""Everyone tells me I chew gum
 with my mouth open. Don't you
 hate that?""


 ""Naw, that's part of your
 charm,"" Spencer assured her.


 ""How 'bout me, sugar,"" asked
 the girl with the coal black hair.


 ""Ah, you're perfect, too. You
 are all perfect. I've never seen
 such a collection of dolls as parade
 around this here city.
 C'mon, kids—how 'bout another
 round?""


 But the dolls had apparently
 lost interest in him. They got up
 one by one and walked out of the
 bar. Pembroke took his rum and
 tonic and moved over to Spencer's
 booth.


 ""Okay if I join you?""


 ""Sure,"" said the fat man.
 ""Wonder what the hell got into
 those babes?""


 ""You said they were perfect.
 They know they're not. You've
 got to be rough with them in this
 town,"" said Pembroke. ""That's
 all they want from us.""


 ""Mister, you've been doing
 some thinkin', I can see,"" said
 Spencer, peering at him suspiciously.
 ""Maybe you've figured
 out where we are.""


 ""Your bet's as good as mine,""
 said Pembroke. ""It's not Wellington,
 and it's not Brisbane, and
 it's not Long Beach, and it's not
 Tahiti. There are a lot of places
 it's not. But where the hell it is,
 you tell me.


 ""And, by the way,"" he added,
 ""I hope you like it in Puerto
 Pacifico. Because there isn't any
 place to go from here and there
 isn't any way to get there if
 there were.""


 ""Pardon me, gentlemen, but
 I'm Joe Valencia, manager of the
 hotel. I would be very grateful if
 you would give me a few minutes
 of honest criticism.""


 ""Ah, no, not you, too,"" groaned
 Spencer. ""Look, Joe, what's
 the gag?""


 ""You are newcomers, Mr.
 Spencer,"" Valencia explained.
 ""You are therefore in an excellent
 position to point out our
 faults as you see them.""


 ""Well, so what?"" demanded
 Spencer. ""I've got more important
 things to do than to worry
 about your troubles. You look
 okay to me.""


 ""Mr. Valencia,"" said Pembroke.
 ""I've noticed that you
 walk with a very slight limp. If
 you have a bad leg, I should
 think you would do better to develop
 a more pronounced limp.
 Otherwise, you may appear to
 be self-conscious about it.""
Spencer opened his mouth to
 protest, but saw with amazement
 that it was exactly this that
 Valencia was seeking. Pembroke
 was amused at his companion's
 reaction but observed that Spencer
 still failed to see the point.


 ""Also, there is a certain effeminateness
 in the way in which
 you speak,"" said Pembroke. ""Try
 to be a little more direct, a little
 more brusque. Speak in a monotone.
 It will make you more acceptable.""


 ""Thank you so much,"" said the
 manager. ""There is much food
 for thought in what you have
 said, Mr. Pembroke. However,
 Mr. Spencer, your value has failed
 to prove itself. You have only
 yourself to blame. Cooperation is
 all we require of you.""


 Valencia left. Spencer ordered
 another martini. Neither he nor
 Pembroke spoke for several minutes.


 ""Somebody's crazy around
 here,"" the fat man muttered
 after a few moments. ""Is it me,
 Frank?""


 ""No. You just don't belong
 here, in this particular place,""
 said Pembroke thoughtfully.
 ""You're the wrong type. But they
 couldn't know that ahead of time.
 The way they operate it's a
 pretty hit-or-miss operation. But
 they don't care one bit about us,
 Spencer. Consider the men who
 went down with the ship. That
 was just part of the game.""


 ""What the hell are you sayin'?""
 asked Spencer in disbelief.
 ""You figure
they
sunk the ship?
 Valencia and the waitress and
 the three babes? Ah, come on.""


 ""It's what you think that will
 determine what you do, Spencer.
 I suggest you change your attitude;
 play along with them for a
 few days till the picture becomes
 a little clearer to you. We'll talk
 about it again then.""


 Pembroke rose and started out
 of the bar. A policeman entered
 and walked directly to Spencer's
 table. Loitering at the juke box,
 Pembroke overheard the conversation.


 ""You Spencer?""


 ""That's right,"" said the fat
 man sullenly.


 ""What don't you like about
 me? The
truth
, buddy.""


 ""Ah, hell! Nothin' wrong
 with you at all, and nothin'll
 make me say there is,"" said Spencer.


 ""You're the guy, all right. Too
 bad, Mac,"" said the cop.


 Pembroke heard the shots as
 he strolled casually out into the
 brightness of the hotel lobby.
 While he waited for the elevator,
 he saw them carrying the body
 into the street. How many others,
 he wondered, had gone out on
 their backs during their first day
 in Puerto Pacifico?
Pembroke shaved, showered,
 and put on the new suit and shirt
 he had bought. Then he took
 Mary Ann, the woman he had
 met on the beach, out to dinner.
 She would look magnificent even
 when fully clothed, he decided,
 and the pale chartreuse gown she
 wore hardly placed her in that
 category. Her conversation seemed
 considerably more normal
 after the other denizens of
 Puerto Pacifico Pembroke had
 listened to that afternoon.


 After eating they danced for
 an hour, had a few more drinks,
 then went to Pembroke's room.
 He still knew nothing about her
 and had almost exhausted his
 critical capabilities, but not once
 had she become annoyed with
 him. She seemed to devour every
 factual point of imperfection
 about herself that Pembroke
 brought to her attention. And,
 fantastically enough, she actually
 appeared to have overcome every
 little imperfection he had been
 able to communicate to her.


 It was in the privacy of his
 room that Pembroke became
 aware of just how perfect, physically,
 Mary Ann was. Too perfect.
 No freckles or moles anywhere
 on the visible surface of
 her brown skin, which was more
 than a mere sampling. Furthermore,
 her face and body were
 meticulously symmetrical. And
 she seemed to be wholly ambidextrous.


 ""With so many beautiful
 women in Puerto Pacifico,"" said
 Pembroke probingly, ""I find it
 hard to understand why there are
 so few children.""


 ""Yes, children are decorative,
 aren't they,"" said Mary Ann. ""I
 do wish there were more of
 them.""


 ""Why not have a couple of
 your own?"" he asked.


 ""Oh, they're only given to maternal
 types. I'd never get one.
 Anyway, I won't ever marry,""
 she said. ""I'm the paramour
 type.""


 It was obvious that the liquor
 had been having some effect.
 Either that, or she had a basic
 flaw of loquacity that no one else
 had discovered. Pembroke decided
 he would have to cover his
 tracks carefully.


 ""What type am I?"" he asked.


 ""Silly, you're real. You're not
 a type at all.""


 ""Mary Ann, I love you very
 much,"" Pembroke murmured,
 gambling everything on this one
 throw. ""When you go to Earth
 I'll miss you terribly.""


 ""Oh, but you'll be dead by
 then,"" she pouted. ""So I mustn't
 fall in love with you. I don't want
 to be miserable.""


 ""If I pretended I was one of
 you, if I left on the boat with
 you, they'd let me go to Earth
 with you. Wouldn't they?""


 ""Oh, yes, I'm sure they would.""


 ""Mary Ann, you have two
 other flaws I feel I should mention.""


 ""Yes? Please tell me.""


 ""In the first place,"" said Pembroke,
 ""you should be willing to
 fall in love with me even if it
 will eventually make you unhappy.
 How can you be the paramour
 type if you refuse to fall in
 love foolishly? And when you
 have fallen in love, you should be
 very loyal.""


 ""I'll try,"" she said unsurely.
 ""What else?""


 ""The other thing is that, as
 my mistress, you must never
 mention me to anyone. It would
 place me in great danger.""


 ""I'll never tell anyone anything
 about you,"" she promised.


 ""Now try to love me,"" Pembroke
 said, drawing her into his
 arms and kissing with little
 pleasure the smooth, warm perfection
 of her tanned cheeks.
 ""Love me my sweet, beautiful,
 affectionate Mary Ann. My paramour.""


 Making love to Mary Ann was
 something short of ecstasy. Not
 for any obvious reason, but because
 of subtle little factors that
 make a woman a woman. Mary
 Ann had no pulse. Mary Ann did
 not perspire. Mary Ann did not
 fatigue gradually but all at once.
 Mary Ann breathed regularly
 under all circumstances. Mary
 Ann talked and talked and talked.
 But then, Mary Ann was not
 a human being.


 When she left the hotel at midnight,
 Pembroke was quite sure
 that she understood his plan and
 that she was irrevocably in love
 with him. Tomorrow might bring
 his death, but it might also ensure
 his escape. After forty-two
 years of searching for a passion,
 for a cause, for a loyalty, Frank
 Pembroke had at last found his.
 Earth and the human race that
 peopled it. And Mary Ann would
 help him to save it.
The next morning Pembroke
 talked to Valencia about hunting.
 He said that he planned to go
 shooting out on the desert which
 surrounded the city. Valencia
 told him that there were no living
 creatures anywhere but in
 the city. Pembroke said he was
 going out anyway.


 He picked up Mary Ann at her
 apartment and together they
 went to a sporting goods store.
 As he guessed there was a goodly
 selection of firearms, despite the
 fact that there was nothing to
 hunt and only a single target
 range within the city. Everything,
 of course, had to be just
 like Earth. That, after all, was
 the purpose of Puerto Pacifico.


 By noon they had rented a
 jeep and were well away from
 the city. Pembroke and Mary
 Ann took turns firing at the paper
 targets they had purchased. At
 twilight they headed back to the
 city. On the outskirts, where the
 sand and soil were mixed and no
 footprints would be left, Pembroke
 hopped off. Mary Ann
 would go straight to the police
 and report that Pembroke had attacked
 her and that she had shot
 him. If necessary, she would conduct
 the authorities to the place
 where they had been target
 shooting, but would be unable to
 locate the spot where she had
 buried the body. Why had she
 buried it? Because at first she
 was not going to report the incident.
 She was frightened. It
 was not airtight, but there would
 probably be no further investigation.
 And they certainly would
 not prosecute Mary Ann for killing
 an Earthman.


 Now Pembroke had himself to
 worry about. The first step was
 to enter smoothly into the new
 life he had planned. It wouldn't
 be so comfortable as the previous
 one, but should be considerably
 safer. He headed slowly for the
 ""old"" part of town, aging his
 clothes against buildings and
 fences as he walked. He had already
 torn the collar of the shirt
 and discarded his belt. By morning
 his beard would grow to
 blacken his face. And he would
 look weary and hungry and aimless.
 Only the last would be a deception.
Two weeks later Pembroke
 phoned Mary Ann. The police
 had accepted her story without
 even checking. And when, when
 would she be seeing him again?
 He had aroused her passion and
 no amount of long-distance love
 could requite it. Soon, he assured
 her, soon.


 ""Because, after all, you do owe
 me something,"" she added.


 And that was bad because it
 sounded as if she had been giving
 some womanly thought to the situation.
 A little more of that and
 she might go to the police again,
 this time for vengeance.


 Twice during his wanderings
 Pembroke had seen the corpses
 of Earthmen being carted out of
 buildings. They had to be Earthmen
 because they bled. Mary Ann
 had admitted that she did not.
 There would be very few Earthmen
 left in Puerto Pacifico, and
 it would be simple enough to locate
 him if he were reported as
 being on the loose. There was
 no out but to do away with Mary
 Ann.


 Pembroke headed for the
 beach. He knew she invariably
 went there in the afternoon. He
 loitered around the stalls where
 hot dogs and soft drinks were
 sold, leaning against a post in
 the hot sun, hat pulled down over
 his forehead. Then he noticed
 that people all about him were
 talking excitedly. They were discussing
 a ship. It was leaving
 that afternoon. Anyone who
 could pass the interview would
 be sent to Earth.


 Pembroke had visited the
 docks every day, without being
 able to learn when the great
 exodus would take place. Yet he
 was certain the first lap would be
 by water rather than by spaceship,
 since no one he had talked
 to in the city had ever heard of
 spaceships. In fact, they knew
 very little about their masters.


 Now the ship had arrived and
 was to leave shortly. If there was
 any but the most superficial examination,
 Pembroke would no
 doubt be discovered and exterminated.
 But since no one seemed
 concerned about anything but his
 own speech and behavior, he assumed
 that they had all qualified
 in every other respect. The reason
 for transporting Earth People
 to this planet was, of course,
 to apply a corrective to any of
 the Pacificos' aberrant mannerisms
 or articulation. This was
 the polishing up phase.
Pembroke began hobbling toward
 the docks. Almost at once
 he found himself face to face
 with Mary Ann. She smiled happily
 when she recognized him.
That
was a good thing.


 ""It is a sign of poor breeding
 to smile at tramps,"" Pembroke
 admonished her in a whisper.
 ""Walk on ahead.""


 She obeyed. He followed. The
 crowd grew thicker. They neared
 the docks and Pembroke saw that
 there were now set up on the
 roped-off wharves small interviewing
 booths. When it was
 their turn, he and Mary Ann
 each went into separate ones.
 Pembroke found himself alone in
 the little room.


 Then he saw that there was
 another entity in his presence
 confined beneath a glass dome. It
 looked rather like a groundhog
 and had seven fingers on each of
 its six limbs. But it was larger
 and hairier than the glass one
 he had seen at the gift store.
 With four of its limbs it tapped
 on an intricate keyboard in front
 of it.


 ""What is your name?"" queried
 a metallic voice from a speaker
 on the wall.


 ""I'm Jerry Newton. Got no
 middle initial,"" Pembroke said in
 a surly voice.


 ""Occupation?""


 ""I work a lot o' trades. Fisherman,
 fruit picker, fightin' range
 fires, vineyards, car washer. Anything.
 You name it. Been out of
 work for a long time now,
 though. Goin' on five months.
 These here are hard times, no
 matter what they say.""


 ""What do you think of the
 Chinese situation?"" the voice inquired.


 ""Which situation's 'at?""


 ""Where's Seattle?""


 ""Seattle? State o' Washington.""


 And so it went for about five
 minutes. Then he was told he
 had qualified as a satisfactory
 surrogate for a mid-twentieth
 century American male, itinerant
 type.


 ""You understand your mission,
 Newton?"" the voice asked. ""You
 are to establish yourself on
 Earth. In time you will receive
 instructions. Then you will attack.
 You will not see us, your
 masters, again until the atmosphere
 has been sufficiently chlorinated.
 In the meantime, serve
 us well.""


 He stumbled out toward the
 docks, then looked about for
 Mary Ann. He saw her at last
 behind the ropes, her lovely face
 in tears.


 Then she saw him. Waving
 frantically, she called his name
 several times. Pembroke mingled
 with the crowd moving toward
 the ship, ignoring her. But still
 the woman persisted in her
 shouting.


 Sidling up to a well-dressed
 man-about-town type, Pembroke
 winked at him and snickered.


 ""You Frank?"" he asked.


 ""Hell, no. But some poor
 punk's sure red in the face, I'll
 bet,"" the man-about-town said
 with a chuckle. ""Those high-strung
 paramour types always
 raising a ruckus. They never do
 pass the interview. Don't know
 why they even make 'em.""


 Suddenly Mary Ann was quiet.


 ""Ambulance squad,"" Pembroke's
 companion explained.
 ""They'll take her off to the buggy
 house for a few days and bring
 her out fresh and ignorant as the
 day she was assembled. Don't
 know why they keep making 'em,
 as I say. But I guess there's a
 call for that type up there on
 Earth.""


 ""Yeah, I reckon there is at
 that,"" said Pembroke, snickering
 again as he moved away from the
 other. ""And why not? Hey?
 Why not?""


 Pembroke went right on hating
 himself, however, till the
 night he was deposited in a field
 outside of Ensenada, broke but
 happy, with two other itinerant
 types. They separated in San
 Diego, and it was not long before
 Pembroke was explaining to the
 police how he had drifted far
 from the scene of the sinking of
 the
Elena Mia
on a piece of
 wreckage, and had been picked
 up by a Chilean trawler. How he
 had then made his way, with
 much suffering, up the coast to
 California. Two days later, his
 identity established and his circumstances
 again solvent, he was
 headed for Los Angeles to begin
 his save-Earth campaign.
Now, seated at his battered
 desk in the shabby rented office
 over Lemark's Liquors, Pembroke
 gazed without emotion at
 the two demolished Pacificos that
 lay sprawled one atop the other
 in the corner. His watch said
 one-fifteen. The man from the
 FBI should arrive soon.


 There were footsteps on the
 stairs for the third time that
 day. Not the brisk, efficient steps
 of a federal official, but the hesitant,
 self-conscious steps of a
 junior clerk type.


 Pembroke rose as the young
 man appeared at the door. His
 face was smooth, unpimpled,
 clean-shaven, without sweat on a
 warm summer afternoon.


 ""Are you Dr. Von Schubert?""
 the newcomer asked, peering into
 the room. ""You see, I've got a
 problem—""


 The four shots from Pembroke's
 pistol solved his problem
 effectively. Pembroke tossed his
 third victim onto the pile, then
 opened a can of lager, quaffing
 it appreciatively. Seating himself
 once more, he leaned back in
 the chair, both feet upon the
 desk.


 He would be out of business
 soon, once the FBI agent had got
 there. Pembroke was only in it to
 get the proof he would need to
 convince people of the truth of
 his tale. But in the meantime he
 allowed himself to admire the
 clipping of the newspaper ad he
 had run in all the Los Angeles
 papers for the past week. The
 little ad that had saved mankind
 from God-knew-what insidious
 menace. It read:
ARE YOU IMPERFECT?

The large horse plodded slowly over the shifting sand.


 The rider was of medium size, with huge, strong hands and seemingly
 hollow eyes. Strange eyes, alive and aflame. They had no place in
 the dust-caked, tired body, yet there they were, seeking, always
 seeking—searching the clear horizon, and never seeming to find what
 they sought.
The horse moved faster now. They were nearing a river; the water would
 be welcome on tired bodies and dry throats. He spurred his horse,
 and when they reached the water's edge, he dismounted and unsaddled
 the horse. Then both man and horse plunged headlong into the waiting
 torrent, deep into the cool embrace of the clear liquid. They soaked it
 into their pores and drank deeply of it, feeling life going once more
 through their veins. Satisfied, they lifted themselves from the water,
 and the man lay down on the yellow sand of the river bank to sleep.


 When he awoke, the sun was almost setting. The bright shafts of red
 light spilled across the sky, making the mountains silent scarlet
 shadows on the face of the rippling water. Quickly he gathered
 driftwood, and built a small fire. From his pack he removed some of
 the coffee he had found in one of the ruined cities. He brought water
 from the river in the battered coffee-pot he had salvaged, and while he
 waited for it to boil, he went to his horse, Conqueror, stroking his
 mane and whispering in his ear. Then he led him silently to a grassy
 slope where he hobbled him and left him for the night.


 In the fading light, he ate the hard beef jerky and drank the scalding
 coffee. Refreshed and momentarily content, he sat staring into the
 dying fire, seeing the bright glowing coals as living fingers clutching
 at the wood in consuming embrace, taking all and returning nothing but
 ashes.


 Slowly his eyelids yielded. His body sagged, and blood seemed to fill
 his brain, bathing it in a gentle, warm flood.


 He slept. His brain slept.


 But the portion of his brain called memory stirred. It was all alone;
 all else was at rest. Images began to appear, drawn from inexhaustible
 files, wherein are kept all thoughts, past, present, and future....
It was the night before he was to go overseas. World War III had been
 declared, and he had enlisted, receiving his old rank of captain. He
 was with his wife in the living room of their home. They had put the
 children to bed—their sons—and now sat on the couch, watching the
 blazing fire. It was then that he had showed it to her.


 ""I've got something to tell you, and something to show you.""


 He had removed the box from his pocket and opened it. And heard her cry
 of surprised joy.


 ""Oh, a ring, and it's a diamond, too!"" she cried in her rich, happy
 voice which always seemed to send a thrill through his body.


 ""It's for you; so long as you wear it, I'll come back, even from the
 dead, if need be. Read the inscription.""


 She held the ring up to the light and read aloud, ""It is forever.""


 Then she had slipped the ring on her finger and her arms around him.
 He held her very close, feeling the warmth from her body flowing into
 his and making him oblivious to everything except that she was there in
 his arms and that he was sinking deep, deep into a familiar sea, where
 he had been many times before but each time found something new and
 unexplored, some vastly different emotion he could never quite explain.


 ""Wait!"" she cried. ""I've something for you, too.""


 She took off the locket she wore about her neck and held it up to the
 shimmering light, letting it spin at the end of its chain. It caught
 the shadows of the fire and reflected them, greatly magnified, over the
 room. It was in the shape of a star, encrusted with emeralds, with one
 large ruby in the center. When he opened it, he found a picture of her
 in one side, and in the other a picture of the children. He took her in
 his arms again, and loosened her long, black hair, burying his face in
 it for a moment. Then he kissed her, and instantly was drawn down into
 the abyss which seemed to have no beginning or any end.


 The next morning had been bleak and gray. The mist clung to the wet,
 sodden ground, and the air was heavy in his lungs. He had driven off
 in the jeep the army had sent for him, watching her there on the porch
 until the mist swirled around her feet and she ran back into the house
 and slammed the door. His cold fingers found the locket, making a
 little bulge under his uniform, and the touch of it seemed to warm the
 blood in his veins.


 Three days later they had landed in Spain, merged with another
 division, then crossed the Pyrenees into France, and finally to Paris
 where the fighting had begun. Already the city was a silent graveyard,
 littered with the rubble of towers and cathedrals which had once been
 great.


 Three years later they were on the road to Moscow. Over a thousand
 miles lay behind, a dead man on every foot of those miles. Yet victory
 was near. The Russians had not yet used the H-bomb; the threat of
 annihilation by the retaliation forces had been too great.


 He had done well in the war, and had been decorated many times for
 bravery in action. Now he felt the victory that seemed to be in the
 air, and he had wished it would come quickly, so that he might return
 to her. Home. The very feel of the word was everything a battle-weary
 soldier needed to make him fight harder and live longer.


 Suddenly he had become aware of a droning, wooshing sound above him. It
 grew louder and louder until he knew what it was.


 ""Heavy bombers!"" The alarm had sounded, and the men had headed for
 their foxholes.


 But the planes had passed over, the sun glinting on their bellies,
 reflecting a blinding light. They were bound for bigger, more important
 targets. When the all-clear had sounded, the men clambered from their
 shelters. An icy wind swept the field, bringing with it clouds which
 covered the sun. A strange fear had gripped him then....


 Across the Atlantic, over the pole, via Alaska, the great bombers
 flew. In cities, great and small, the air raid sirens sounded, high
 screaming noises which had jarred the people from sleep in time to die.
 The defending planes roared into the sky to intercept the on-rushing
 bombers. The horrendous battle split the universe. Many bombers fell,
 victims of fanatical suicide planes, or of missiles that streaked
 across the sky which none could escape.


 But too many bombers got through, dropping their deadly cargo upon the
 helpless cities. And not all the prayers or entreaties to any God had
 stopped their carnage. First there had been the red flashes that melted
 buildings into molten streams, and then the great triple-mushroom cloud
 filled with the poisonous gases that the wind swept away to other
 cities, where men had not died quickly and mercifully, but had rotted
 away, leaving shreds of putrid flesh behind to mark the places where
 they had crawled.


 The retaliatory forces had roared away to bomb the Russian cities. Few,
 if any, had returned. Too much blood and life were on their hands.
 Those who had remained alive had found a resting place on the crown
 of some distant mountain. Others had preferred the silent peaceful
 sea, where flesh stayed not long on bones, and only darting fishes and
 merciful beams of filtered light found their aluminum coffins.


 The war had ended.


 To no avail. Neither side had won. Most of the cities and the majority
 of the population of both countries had been destroyed. Even their
 governments had vanished, leaving a silent nothingness. The armies that
 remained were without leaders, without sources of supplies, save what
 they could forage and beg from an unfriendly people.


 They were alone now, a group of tired, battered men, for whom life held
 nothing. Their families had long since died, their bodies turned to
 dust, their spirits fled on the winds to a new world.


 Yet these remnants of an army must return—or at least try. Their
 exodus was just beginning. Somehow he had managed to hold together the
 few men left from his force. He had always nourished the hope that
 she might still be alive. And now that the war was over he had to
 return—had to know whether she was still waiting for him.


 They had started the long trek. Throughout Europe anarchy reigned. He
 and his men were alone. All they could do now was fight. Finally they
 reached the seaport city of Calais. With what few men he had left, he
 had commandeered a small yacht, and they had taken to the sea.


 After months of storms and bad luck, they had been shipwrecked
 somewhere off the coast of Mexico. He had managed to swim ashore,
 and had been found by a fisherman's family. Many months he had spent
 swimming and fishing, recovering his strength, inquiring about the
 United States. The Mexicans had spoken with fear of the land across the
 Rio Grande. All its great cities had been destroyed, and those that had
 been only partially destroyed were devoid of people. The land across
 the Rio Grande had become a land of shadows. The winds were poisoned,
 and the few people who might have survived, were crazed and maimed by
 the blasts. Few men had dared cross the Rio Grande into ""El Mundo gris
 de Noviembre""—the November world. Those who had, had never returned.


 In time he had traveled north until he reached the Rio Grande. He had
 waded into the muddy waters and somehow landed on the American side. In
 the November world.


 It was rightly called. The deserts were long. All plant life had died,
 leaving to those once great fertile stretches, nothing but the sad,
 temporal beauty that comes with death. No people had he seen. Only the
 ruins of what had once been their cities. He had walked through them,
 and all that he had seen were the small mutant rodents, and all that he
 had heard was the occasional swish of the wind as it whisked along what
 might have been dead leaves, but wasn't.


 He had been on the trail for a long time. His food was nearly
 exhausted. The mountains were just beginning, and he hoped to find food
 there. He had not found food, but his luck had been with him. He had
 found a horse. Not a normal horse, but a mutation. It was almost twice
 as large as a regular horse. Its skin seemed to shimmer and was like
 glassy steel to the touch. From the center of its forehead grew a horn,
 straight out, as the horn of a unicorn. But most startling of all were
 the animal's eyes which seemed to speak—a silent mental speech, which
 he could understand. The horse had looked up as he approached it and
 seemed to say: ""Follow me.""


 And he had followed. Over a mountain, until they came to a pass, and
 finally to a narrow path which led to an old cabin. He had found it
 empty, but there were cans of food and a rifle and many shells. He had
 remained there a long time—how long he could not tell, for he could
 only measure time by the cycles of the sun and the moon. Finally he
 had taken the horse, the rifle and what food was left, and once again
 started the long journey home.


 The farther north he went, the more life seemed to have survived. He
 had seen great herds of horses like his own, stampeding across the
 plains, and strange birds which he could not identify. Yet he had seen
 no human beings.


 But he knew he was closer now. Closer to home. He recognized the land.
 How, he did not know, for it was much changed. A sensing, perhaps, of
 what it had once been. He could not be more than two days' ride away.
 Once he was through this desert, he would find her, he would be with
 her once again; all would be well, and his long journey would be over.
The images faded. Even memory slept in a flow of warm blood. Body and
 mind slept into the shadows of the dawn.


 He awoke and stretched the cramped muscles of his body. At the edge of
 the water he removed his clothes and stared at himself in the rippling
 mirror. His muscles were lean and hard, evenly placed throughout the
 length of his frame. A deep ridge ran down the length of his torso,
 separating the muscles, making the chest broad. Well satisfied with his
 body, he plunged into the cold water, deep down, until he thought his
 lungs would burst; then swiftly returned to the clean air, tingling in
 every pore. He dried himself and dressed. Conqueror was eating the long
 grass near the stream. Quickly he saddled him. No time for breakfast.
 He would ride all day and the next night. And he would be home.


 Still northward. The hours crawled slower than a dying man. The sun
 was a torch that pierced his skin, seeming to melt his bones into a
 burning stream within his body. But day at last gave way to night, and
 the sun to the moon. The torch became a white pock-marked goddess, with
 streaming hair called stars.


 In the moonlight he had not seen the crater until he was at its
 very edge. Even then he might not have seen it had not the horse
 stopped suddenly. The wind swirled through its vast emptiness,
 slapping his face with dusty hands. For a moment he thought he heard
 voices—mournful, murmuring voices, echoing up from the misty depths.
 He turned quickly away and did not look back.


 Night paled into day; day burned into night.


 There were clouds in the sky now, and a gentle wind caressed the sweat
 from his tired body. He stopped. There it was! Barely discernible
 through the moonlight, he saw it. Home.


 Quickly he dismounted and ran. Now he could see a small light in the
 window, and he knew they were there. His breath came in hard ragged
 gulps. At the window he peered in, and as his eyes became accustomed
 to the inner gloom, he saw how bare the room was. No matter. Now that
 he was home he would build new furniture, and the house would be even
 better than it had been before.


 Then he saw her.


 She was sitting motionless in a straight wooden chair beside the
 fireplace, the feeble light cast by the embers veiling her in mauve
 shadows. He waited, wondering if she were.... Presently she stirred
 like a restless child in sleep, then moved from the chair to the pile
 of wood near the hearth, and replenished the fire. The wood caught
 quickly, sending up long tongues of flame, and forming a bright pool of
 light around her.


 His blood froze. The creature illuminated by the firelight was a
 monster. Large greasy scales covered its face and arms, and there was
 no hair on its head. Its gums were toothless cavities in a sunken,
 mumbling mouth. The eyes, turned momentarily toward the window, were
 empty of life.


 ""No, no!"" he cried soundlessly.


 This was not his house. In his delirium he had only imagined he had
 found it. He had been searching so long. He would go on searching.
 He was turning wearily away from the window when the movement of the
 creature beside the fire held his attention. It had taken a ring from
 one skeleton-like finger and stood, turning the ring slowly as if
 trying to decipher some inscription inside it.


 He knew then. He had come home.


 Slowly he moved toward the door. A great weakness was upon him. His
 feet were stones, reluctant to leave the earth. His body was a weed,
 shriveled by thirst. He grasped the doorknob and clung to it, looking
 up at the night sky and trying to draw strength from the wind that
 passed over him. It was no use. There was no strength. Only fear—a
 kind of fear he had never known.


 He fumbled at his throat, his fingers crawling like cold worms around
 his neck until he found the locket and the clasp which had held it
 safely through endless nightmare days and nights. He slipped the clasp
 and the locket fell into his waiting hand. As one in a dream, he opened
 it, and stared at the pictures, now in the dim moonlight no longer
 faces of those he loved, but grey ghosts from the past. Even the ruby
 had lost its glow. What had once been living fire was now a dull glob
 of darkness.


 ""Nothing is forever!"" He thought he had shouted the words, but only a
 thin sound, the sound of leaves ruffled by the wind, came back to him.


 He closed the locket and fastened the clasp, and hung it on the
 doorknob. It moved slowly in the wind, back and forth, like a pendulum.
 ""Forever—forever. Only death is forever."" He could have sworn he heard
 the words.


 He ran. Away from the house. To the large horse with a horn in the
 center of its forehead, like a unicorn. Once in the saddle, the spurt
 of strength left him. His shoulders slumped, his head dropped onto his
 chest.


 Conqueror trotted away, the sound of his hooves echoing hollowly in the
 vast emptiness.

         In the animated ecological epic                    Princess Mononoke                , the camera travels over landscapes with a clear, steady gaze, like a Zen hang glider. The images have none of the comin'-at-ya pop-surrealism of American cartoons, many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack-in-the-boxes. The Japanese director, Hayao Miyazaki, who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself, seems to work from the outside in: to begin with the curve of the earth, then the mossy hills, the watercolor foliage, the nubby stones, the whorls on the wood, the meticulous carvings on a teacup. He captures the texture of light and the currents of air. You could almost settle down in this landscape. A view of nature that some would call ""tree-hugging"" doesn't feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail. 

         But then, ""soft"" is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke , however pantheistic its worldview. The film, which is rated PG-13, is full of splattery carnage. If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative, in close-up he's ferocious. He's both inside and outside the action: He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment. According to the New                 York Times , Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged, and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features. Watching Princess                 Mononoke --which has been dubbed to Disney/Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two-hour-plus length, its gory beheadings, and its grim, near-apocalyptic finale--you can understand their worship. It isn't that Miyazaki's work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles; it's that everything is sublimely in proportion. 

         The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood's homiletic, follow-your-dream fables look even more solipsistic. Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history (the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries) when the power shifted from a ""natural"" world to one shaped by human technology. It's the beginning of what Bill McKibben called ""the end of nature""--that is, when nature became no longer an autonomous, self-regulating force but one touched (and, in Miyazaki's view, poisoned) by human industry. 

         The hero, Ashitaka, a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan, is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar--a god turned into a demon (covered in roiling, corrosive worms) by an iron ball lodged in its body. Infected, destined to be consumed by--and to die of--rage, Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball's source. He discovers a fortress-cum-arms-manufacturing plant called Irontown, presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film: the regal Lady Eboshi. On one hand, she's a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society; on the other, she wants to destroy the forest, harness its resources, and exterminate its animal deities--chiefly the Spirit of the Forest, a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death, and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker. 

         P rincess Mononoke builds to a full-scale war between humans and the animal kingdom--which does not, by the way, consist of your father's cartoon critters. In fact, the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka's call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony; they'd like to eat him. The wolf god, Moro, is slightly more sympathetic, but that's because her adopted ""daughter,"" San (a k a Princess Mononoke), is human. San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother, then, as the gore drips from her mouth, training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred. Her second appearance--a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi--is one of the movie's high points. It's Miyazaki's use of sound--and silence--that takes your breath away: the determined tap of the wolf princess's shoes as she scuttles over the fortress's rooftops; the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky. Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition--it's almost subliminal. 

         It's a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him. She loses that punk-bitch allure. The voice of Claire Danes doesn't help. When Danes says, ""I'd do anything to get you humans out of my forest,"" she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall. (San needs a more ragged voice--I'd be interested to hear the original Japanese actress.) Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied (Miramaxed?), but that doesn't hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ingÃ©nu. Gillian Anderson's growling Moro sounds silly (she doesn't have the breath control), and the fey-hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff-like mercenary, Jigo. But Minnie Driver--coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan --once again provides a voice that the animators deserve. ""Bring the strange-ah to me late-ah,"" she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere. ""I would like to thank him puh-sonally."" 

         The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts--but not by a lot. There's always something wondrously strange. The ""kodamas"" are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies. They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks; then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle. Something about them seems just right; I could watch them for hours. (Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds--he doesn't wear out their mystery the way that, say, George Lucas would.) And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse, as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick, caustic, tarlike gel that recalls the post-Hiroshima ""black rain."" Can you take the kids? I think so. As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference, ""Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world."" Princess Mononoke , at least, can tell them why. 

         ""A special smile ... a certain touch ..."" So begins the elevator-music theme song of                    Music of the Heart                 ... ""I never had a lot that I loved so much."" The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag. Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari (played here by Meryl Streep), whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide? A fabled taskmaster (her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders ), Guaspari used music as a way to teach self-discipline--along with the healthy self-respect that follows in its wake. When the New York school board cut the funding for her program, she proved a marvel of self-promotion, attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit ""Fiddlefest""--along with Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern, and other legendary ""fiddlers."" 

         Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin (she doesn't play any instruments) that she didn't bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta. Maybe that's why the performance seems so natural. Let her always learn an instrument on the set! Still, she doesn't make much sense of Guaspari. The script, by Pamela Gray ( A Walk on the Moon ), has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism, but Streep--who has made herself look dumpy, thick-waisted, and bedraggled--is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness. Instead of a monument to an individual's iron will, Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers. 

         Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven (who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels) or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood--to go to the Academy Awards--that they neuter themselves. Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be, they forget that violence--even if it's just emotional violence--belongs in ""ordinary"" dramas, too. Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes, but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy, TV-movie humanism that blands out its texture. OK, I was a puddle after some scenes, like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace. But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman, Stern, Joshua Bell, etc., we'd seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up. There's too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers. 

         In outline,                    The Limey                  is a lean little B-movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit (Terence Stamp) who's newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter's death: ""My name's Wilson ... Who dunnit?"" The film, directed by Steven Soderbergh, would be worth seeing just for Stamp's performance, at once rock-hard and goofily blinkered, and for Peter Fonda's wittily self-parodic turn as the suspected killer, a music producer who coasts on '60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work. (""Oh, man,"" he says, the fear finally seeping through the ether. ""This is getting all too close to me."") 

         But the picture's glory is its layered and intricate syntax. The dialogue moves ahead--there are great gobs of exposition--but the images continually double back: to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren, as his daughter's acting teacher, simply gazing at each other; or to Stamp sitting on a plane, remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach, the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright--almost supernatural--spot that dances over her face. The film's most violent act happens well off screen. (You hear the distant ""pop-pop-pop-pop-pop"" of the hero's gun.) The rest is only half-glimpsed, fantasized, or saturated by memory--or is the present the memory? Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup? 

         Some, including the critic at Time , have questioned Soderbergh's sanity. (But of course--Soderbergh flouts time!) I see a method to his madness. Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey-Boy , Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture. He's saying: This --not all that other stuff--is what's important. He telegraphs the ending--you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter's death--but it's still an emotional wow. The climax justifies the technique. It says the point of this odyssey isn't revenge but regret--for irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love. 

         Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learn on the job. Working within a tight genre structure, he's discovering hundreds of ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel. Is he totally successful? No; he misses now and then, which is why the technique sticks out. But what a fantastic effort. See it and weep for what's missing in most other movies.

houlihan's
 
equation
by ... Walt Sheldon
The tiny spaceship had been built for a journey to a star. But its
 small, mischievous pilots had a rendezvous with destiny—on Earth.
I must
 admit that at first I
 wasn't sure I was hearing those
 noises. It was in a park near the
 nuclear propulsion center—a cool,
 green spot, with the leaves all telling
 each other to hush, be quiet,
 and the soft breeze stirring them up
 again. I had known precisely such
 a secluded little green sanctuary just
 over the hill from Mr. Riordan's
 farm when I was a boy.


 Now it was a place I came to
 when I had a problem to thrash out.
 That morning I had been trying to
 work out an equation to give the
 coefficient of discharge for the matter
 in combustion. You may call it
 gas, if you wish, for we treated it
 like gas at the center for convenience—as
 it came from the rocket
 tubes in our engine.


 Without this coefficient to give
 us control, we would have lacked a
 workable equation when we set
 about putting the first moon rocket
 around those extraordinary engines
 of ours, which were still in the undeveloped
 blueprint stage.


 I see I shall have to explain this,
 although I had hoped to get right
 along with my story. When you
 start from scratch, matter discharged
 from any orifice has a velocity directly
 proportional to the square
 root of the pressure-head driving it.
 But when you actually put things
 together, contractions or expansions
 in the gas, surface roughness
 and other factors make the velocity
 a bit smaller.


 At the terrible discharge speed
 of nuclear explosion—which is
 what the drive amounts to despite
 the fact that it is simply water in
 which nuclear salts have been previously
 dissolved—this small factor
 makes quite a difference. I had
 to figure everything into it—diameter
 of the nozzle, sharpness of the
 edge, the velocity of approach to the
 point of discharge, atomic weight
 and structure— Oh, there is so
 much of this that if you're not a
 nuclear engineer yourself it's certain
 to weary you.


 Perhaps you had better take my
 word for it that without this equation—correctly
 stated, mind you—mankind
 would be well advised not
 to make a first trip to the moon.
 And all this talk of coefficients and
 equations sits strangely, you might
 say, upon the tongue of a man
 named Kevin Francis Houlihan.
 But I am, after all, a scientist. If I
 had not been a specialist in my field
 I would hardly have found myself
 engaged in vital research at the
 center.


 Anyway, I heard these little
 noises in the park. They sounded
 like small working sounds, blending
 in eerily mysterious fashion with a
 chorus of small voices. I thought at
 first it might be children at play,
 but then at the time I was a bit
 absent-minded. I tiptoed to the edge
 of the trees, not wanting to deprive
 any small scalawags of their pleasure,
 and peered out between the
 branches. And what do you suppose
 I saw? Not children, but a
 group of little people, hard at work.


 There was a leader, an older one
 with a crank face. He was beating
 the air with his arms and piping:
 ""Over here, now! All right, bring
 those electrical connections over
 here—and see you're not slow as
 treacle about it!""


 There were perhaps fifty of the
 little people. I was more than startled
 by it, too. I had not seen little
 people in—oh, close to thirty years.
 I had seen them first as a boy of
 eight, and then, very briefly again,
 on my tenth birthday. And I had
 become convinced they could
never
be seen here in America. I had
 never seen them so busy, either.
 They were building something in
 the middle of the glade. It was long
 and shiny and upright and a little
 over five feet in height.


 ""Come along now, people!"" said
 this crotchety one, looking straight
 at me. ""Stop starin' and get to
 work! You'll not be needin' to
 mind that man standin' there! You
 know he can't see nor hear us!""


 Oh, it was good to hear the rich
 old tongue again. I smiled, and the
 foreman of the leprechauns—if
 that's what he was—saw me smile
 and became stiff and alert for a moment,
 as though suspecting that perhaps
 I actually could see him. Then
 he shrugged and turned away, clearly
 deeming such a thing impossible.


 I said, ""Just a minute, friend,
 and I'll beg your pardon. It so happens
 I
can
see you.""


 He whirled to face me again,
 staring open-mouthed. Then he
 said, ""What? What's that, now?""


 ""I can see you,"" I said.


 ""Ohhh!"" he said and put his
 palms to his cheekbones. ""Saints be
 with us! He's a believer! Run everybody—run
 for your lives!""


 And they all began running, in
 as many directions as there were
 little souls. They began to scurry
 behind the trees and bushes, and a
 sloping embankment nearby.


 ""No, wait!"" I said. ""Don't go
 away! I'll not be hurting you!""


 They continued to scurry.


 I knew what it was they feared.
 ""I don't intend catching one of
 you!"" I said. ""Come back, you daft
 little creatures!""


 But the glade was silent, and they
 had all disappeared. They thought I
 wanted their crock of gold, of
 course. I'd be entitled to it if I could
 catch one and keep him. Or so the
 legends affirmed, though I've wondered
 often about the truth of them.
 But I was after no gold. I only wanted
 to hear the music of an Irish
 tongue. I was lonely here in America,
 even if I had latched on to a fine
 job of work for almost shamefully
 generous pay. You see, in a place as
 full of science as the nuclear propulsion
 center there is not much
 time for the old things. I very much
 wanted to talk to the little people.


 I walked over to the center of
 the glade where the curious shiny
 object was standing. It was as
 smooth as glass and shaped like a
 huge cigar. There were a pair of
 triangular fins down at the bottom,
 and stubby wings amidships. Of
 course it was a spaceship, or a
 miniature replica of one. I looked
 at it more closely. Everything seemed
 almost miraculously complete
 and workable.


 I shook my head in wonder, then
 stepped back from the spaceship
 and looked about the glade. I knew
 they were all hiding nearby, watching
 me apprehensively. I lifted my
 head to them.


 ""Listen to me now, little people!""
 I called out. ""My name's
 Houlihan of the Roscommon Houlihans.
 I am descended from King
 Niall himself—or so at least my
 father used to say! Come on out
 now, and pass the time o' day!""


 Then I waited, but they didn't
 answer. The little people always
 had been shy. Yet without reaching
 a decision in so many words I knew
 suddenly that I
had
to talk to them.
 I'd come to the glen to work out a
 knotty problem, and I was up
 against a blank wall. Simply because
 I was so lonely that my mind had
 become clogged.


 I knew that if I could just once
 hear the old tongue again, and talk
 about the old things, I might be able
 to think the problem through to a
 satisfactory conclusion.


 So I stepped back to the tiny
 spaceship, and this time I struck it
 a resounding blow with my fist.
 ""Hear me now, little people! If you
 don't show yourselves and come out
 and talk to me, I'll wreck this spaceship
 from stem to stern!""
I heard only the leaves rustling
 softly.


 ""Do you understand? I'll give
 you until I count three to make an
 appearance! One!""


 The glade remained deathly silent.


 ""Two!""


 I thought I heard a stirring somewhere,
 as if a small, brittle twig had
 snapped in the underbrush.


 ""
Three!
""


 And with that the little people
 suddenly appeared.


 The leader—he seemed more
 wizened and bent than before—approached
 me slowly and warily as I
 stood there. The others all followed
 at a safe distance. I smiled to reassure
 them and then waved my arm
 in a friendly gesture of greeting.


 ""Good morning,"" I said.


 ""Good morning,"" the foreman
 said with some caution. ""My name
 is Keech.""


 ""And mine's Houlihan, as I've
 told you. Are you convinced now
 that I have no intention of doing
 you any injury?""


 ""Mr. Houlihan,"" said Keech,
 drawing a kind of peppered dignity
 up about himself, ""in such matters
 I am never fully convinced. After
 living for many centuries I am all
 too acutely aware of the perversity
 of human nature.""


 ""Yes,"" I said. ""Well, as you will
 quickly see, all I want to do is
 talk."" I nodded as I spoke, and sat
 down cross-legged upon the grass.


 ""Any Irishman wants to talk, Mr.
 Houlihan.""


 ""And often that's
all
he wants,""
 I said. ""Sit down with me now, and
 stop staring as if I were a snake
 returned to the Island.""


 He shook his head and remained
 standing. ""Have your say, Mr.
 Houlihan. And afterward we'll appreciate
 it if you'll go away and
 leave us to our work.""


 ""Well, now, your work,"" I said,
 and glanced at the spaceship.
 ""That's exactly what's got me curious.""


 The others had edged in a bit
 now and were standing in a circle,
 intently staring at me. I took out my
 pipe. ""Why,"" I asked, ""would a
 group of little people be building a
 spaceship here in America—out in
 this lonely place?""


 Keech stared back without much
 expression, and said, ""I've been
 wondering how you guessed it was
 a spaceship. I was surprised enough
 when you told me you could see us
 but not overwhelmingly so. I've run
 into believers before who could see
 the little people. It happens every
 so often, though not as frequently
 as it did a century ago. But knowing
 a spaceship at first glance! Well, I
 must confess that
does
astonish
 me.""


 ""And why wouldn't I know a
 spaceship when I see one?"" I said.
 ""It just so happens I'm a doctor of
 science.""


 ""A doctor of science, now,"" said
 Keech.


 ""Invited by the American government
 to work on the first moon
 rocket here at the nuclear propulsion
 center. Since it's no secret I
 can advise you of it.""


 ""A scientist, is it,"" said Keech.
 ""Well, now, that's very interesting.""


 ""I'll make no apologies for it,"" I
 said.


 ""Oh, there's no need for apology,""
 said Keech. ""Though in truth
 we prefer poets to scientists. But it
 has just now crossed my mind, Mr.
 Houlihan that you, being a scientist,
 might be of help to us.""


 ""How?"" I asked.


 ""Well, I might try starting at the
 beginning,"" he replied.


 ""You might,"" I said. ""A man
 usually does.""


 Keech took out his own pipe—a
 clay dudeen—and looked hopeful.
 I gave him a pinch of tobacco from
 my pouch. ""Well, now,"" he said,
 ""first of all you're no doubt surprised
 to find us here in America.""


 ""I am surprised from time to
 time to find myself here,"" I said.
 ""But continue.""


 ""We had to come here,"" said
 Keech, ""to learn how to make a
 spaceship.""


 ""A spaceship, now,"" I said, unconsciously
 adopting some of the
 old manner.


 ""Leprechauns are not really mechanically
 inclined,"" said Keech.
 ""Their major passions are music
 and laughter and mischief, as anyone
 knows.""


 ""Myself included,"" I agreed.
 ""Then why do you need a spaceship?""


 ""Well, if I may use an old expression,
 we've had a feelin' lately
 that we're not long for this world.
 Or let me put it this way. We feel
 the world isn't long for itself.""


 I scratched my cheek. ""How
 would a man unravel a statement
 such as that?""


 ""It's very simple. With all the
 super weapons you mortals have
 developed, there's the distinct possibility
 you might be blowin' us all
 up in the process of destroying
 yourselves.""


 ""There
is
that possibility,"" I said.


 ""Well, then, as I say,"" said
 Keech, ""the little people have decided
 to leave the planet in a spaceship.
 Which we're buildin' here and
 now. We've spied upon you and
 learned how to do it. Well—almost
 how to do it. We haven't learned
 yet how to control the power—""


 ""Hold on, now,"" I said. ""Leaving
 the planet, you say. And where
 would you be going?""


 ""There's another committee
 working on that. 'Tis not our concern.
 I was inclined to suggest the
 constellation Orion, which sounds
 as though it has a good Irish name,
 but I was hooted down. Be that as it
 may, my own job was to go into
 your nuclear center, learn how to
 make the ship, and proceed with its
 construction. Naturally, we didn't
 understand all of your high-flyin'
 science, but some of our people are
 pretty clever at gettin' up replicas
 of things.""


 ""You mean you've been spying
 on us at the center all this time? Do
 you know, we often had the feeling
 we were being watched, but we
 thought it was by the Russians.
 There's one thing which puzzles
 me, though. If you've been constantly
 around us—and I'm still
 able to see the little people—why
 did I never see you before?""


 ""It may be we never crossed your
 path. It may be you can only see us
 when you're thinkin' of us, and of
 course truly believin' in us. I don't
 know—'tis a thing of the mind, and
 not important at the moment.
 What's important is for us to get
 our first ship to workin' properly
 and then we'll be on our way.""


 ""You're determined to go.""


 ""Truly we are, Mr. Houlihan.
 Now—to business. Just during
 these last few minutes a certain matter
 has crossed my mind. That's
 why I'm wastin' all this time with
 you, sir. You say you are a scientist.""


 ""A nuclear engineer.""


 ""Well, then, it may be that you
 can help us—now that you know
 we're here.""


 ""Help you?""


 ""The power control, Mr. Houlihan.
 As I understand it, 'tis necessary
 to know at any instant exactly
 how much thrust is bein' delivered
 through the little holes in back.
 And on paper it looks simple
 enough—the square of somethin' or
 other. I've got the figures jotted in
 a book when I need 'em. But when
 you get to doin' it it doesn't come
 out exactly as it does on paper.""


 ""You're referring to the necessity
 for a coefficient of discharge.""


 ""Whatever it might be named,""
 said Keech, shrugging. ""'Tis the
 one thing we lack. I suppose eventually
 you people will be gettin'
 around to it. But meanwhile we
 need it right now, if we're to make
 our ship move.""


 ""And you want me to help you
 with this?""


 ""That is exactly what crossed my
 mind.""


 I nodded and looked grave and
 kneaded my chin for a moment softly.
 ""Well, now, Keech,"" I said
 finally, ""why should I help you?""


 ""Ha!"" said Keech, grinning, but
 not with humor, ""the avarice of
 humans! I knew it! Well, Mr. Houlihan,
 I'll give you reason enough.
 The pot o' gold, Mr. Houlihan!""


 ""The one at the end of the rainbow?""


 ""It's not at the end of the rainbow.
 That's a grandmother's tale.
 Nor is it actually in an earthen
 crock. But there's gold, all right,
 enough to make you rich for the
 rest of your life. And I'll make you
 a proposition.""


 ""Go ahead.""


 ""We'll not be needin' gold where
 we're goin'. It's yours if you show
 us how to make our ship work.""


 ""Well, now, that's quite an
 offer,"" I said. Keech had the goodness
 to be quiet while I sat and
 thought for a while. My pipe had
 gone out and I lit it again. I finally
 said, ""Let's have a look at your
 ship's drive and see what we can
 see.""


 ""You accept the proposition
 then?""


 ""Let's have a look,"" I said, and
 that was all.


 Well, we had a look, and then
 several looks, and before the morning
 was out we had half the spaceship
 apart, and were deep in argument
 about the whole project.


 It was a most fascinating session.
 I had often wished for a true working
 model at the center, but no allowance
 had been inserted in the
 budget for it. Keech brought me
 paper and pencil and I talked with
 the aid of diagrams, as engineers
 are wont to do. Although the pencils
 were small and I had to hold
 them between thumb and forefinger,
 as you would a needle, I was
 able to make many sensible observations
 and even a few innovations.


 I came back again the next day—and
 every day for the following
 two weeks. It rained several times,
 but Keech and his people made a
 canopy of boughs and leaves and I
 was comfortable enough. Every once
 in a while someone from the town
 or the center itself would pass by,
 and stop to watch me. But of course
 they wouldn't see the leprechauns
 or anything the leprechauns had
 made, not being believers.


 I would halt work, pass the time
 of day, and then, in subtle fashion,
 send the intruder on his way. Keech
 and the little people just stood by
 and grinned all the while.


 At the end of sixteen days I had
 the entire problem all but whipped.
 It is not difficult to understand why.
 The working model and the fact
 that the small people with their
 quick eyes and clever fingers could
 spot all sorts of minute shortcomings
 was a great help. And I was
 hearing the old tongue and talking
 of the old things every day, and
 truly that went far to take the clutter
 out of my mind. I was no longer
 so lonely that I couldn't think properly.


 On the sixteenth day I covered a
 piece of paper with tiny mathematical
 symbols and handed it to Keech.
 ""Here is your equation,"" I said. ""It
 will enable you to know your thrust
 at any given moment, under any
 circumstances, in or out of gravity,
 and under all conditions of friction
 and combustion.""


 ""Thank you, Mr. Houlihan,"" said
 Keech. All his people had gathered
 in a loose circle, as though attending
 a rite. They were all looking at
 me quietly.


 ""Mr. Houlihan,"" said Keech,
 ""you will not be forgotten by the
 leprechauns. If we ever meet again,
 upon another world perchance,
 you'll find our friendship always
 eager and ready.""


 ""Thank you,"" I said.


 ""And now, Mr. Houlihan,"" said
 Keech, ""I'll see that a quantity of
 gold is delivered to your rooms tonight,
 and so keep my part of the
 bargain.""


 ""I'll not be needing the gold,"" I
 said.


 Keech's eyebrows popped upward.
 ""What's this now?""


 ""I'll not be needing it,"" I repeated.
 ""I don't feel it would be
 right to take it for a service of this
 sort.""


 ""Well,"" said Keech in surprise,
 and in some awe, too, ""well, now,
 musha Lord help us! 'Tis the first
 time I ever heard such a speech
 from a mortal."" He turned to his
 people. ""We'll have three cheers
 now, do you hear, for Mr. Houlihan—friend
 of the little people as
 long as he shall live!""


 And they cheered. And little tears
 crept into the corners of some of
 their turned-up eyes.


 We shook hands, all of us, and I
 left.
I walked through the park, and
 back to the nuclear propulsion center.
 It was another cool, green morning
 with the leaves making only
 soft noises as the breezes came
 along. It smelled exactly like a
 wood I had known in Roscommon.


 And I lit my pipe and smoked it
 slowly and chuckled to myself at
 how I had gotten the best of the
 little people. Surely it was not every
 mortal who could accomplish that. I
 had given them the wrong equation,
 of course. They would never get
 their spaceship to work now, and
 later, if they tried to spy out the
 right information I would take special
 measures to prevent it, for I had
 the advantage of being able to see
 them.


 As for our own rocket ship, it
 should be well on its way by next
 St. Patrick's Day. For I had indeed
 determined the true coefficient of
 discharge, which I never could have
 done so quickly without those sessions
 in the glade with Keech and
 his working model.


 It would go down in scientific
 literature now, I suppose, as Houlihan's
 Equation, and that was honor
 and glory enough for me. I could
 do without Keech's pot of gold,
 though it would have been pleasant
 to be truly rich for a change.


 There was no sense in cheating
 him out of the gold to boot, for
 leprechauns are most clever in matters
 of this sort and he would have
 had it back soon enough—or else
 made it a burden in some way.


 Indeed, I had done a piece of
 work greatly to my advantage, and
 also to the advantage of humankind,
 and when a man can do the first and
 include the second as a fortunate byproduct
 it is a most happy accident.


 For if I had shown the little people
 how to make a spaceship they
 would have left our world. And
 this world, as long as it lasts—what
 would it be in that event? I ask you
 now, wouldn't we be even
more
likely to blow ourselves to Kingdom
 Come without the little people here
 for us to believe in every now and
 then?

It has happened a hundred times in the long history
 
of Earth—and, sooner or later, will happen again!
Everyone—all the geologists, at any rate—had known about the Kiowa
 Fault for years. That was before there was anything very interesting
 to know about it. The first survey of Colorado traced its course north
 and south in the narrow valley of Kiowa Creek about twenty miles east
 of Denver; it extended south to the Arkansas River. And that was about
 all even the professionals were interested in knowing. There was never
 so much as a landslide to bring the Fault to the attention of the
 general public.


 It was still a matter of academic interest when in the late '40s
 geologists speculated on the relationship between the Kiowa Fault and
 the Conchas Fault farther south, in New Mexico, and which followed the
 Pecos as far south as Texas.


 Nor was there much in the papers a few years later when it was
 suggested that the Niobrara Fault (just inside and roughly parallel to
 the eastern border of Wyoming) was a northerly extension of the Kiowa.
 By the mid sixties it was definitely established that the three Faults
 were in fact a single line of fissure in the essential rock, stretching
 almost from the Canadian border well south of the New Mexico-Texas line.


 It is not really surprising that it took so long to figure out the
 connection. The population of the states affected was in places as
 low as five people per square mile! The land was so dry it seemed
 impossible that it could ever be used except for sheep-farming.


 It strikes us today as ironic that from the late '50s there was grave
 concern about the level of the water table throughout the entire area.
The even more ironic solution to the problem began in the summer of
 1973. It had been a particularly hot and dry August, and the Forestry
 Service was keeping an anxious eye out for the fires it knew it could
 expect. Dense smoke was reported rising above a virtually uninhabited
 area along Black Squirrel Creek, and a plane was sent out for a report.


 The report was—no fire at all. The rising cloud was not smoke, but
 dust. Thousands of cubic feet of dry earth rising lazily on the summer
 air. Rock slides, they guessed; certainly no fire. The Forestry Service
 had other worries at the moment, and filed the report.


 But after a week had gone by, the town of Edison, a good twenty miles
 away from the slides, was still complaining of the dust. Springs was
 going dry, too, apparently from underground disturbances. Not even in
 the Rockies could anyone remember a series of rock slides as bad as
 this.


 Newspapers in the mountain states gave it a few inches on the front
 page; anything is news in late August. And the geologists became
 interested. Seismologists were reporting unusual activity in the area,
 tremors too severe to be rock slides. Volcanic activity? Specifically,
 a dust volcano? Unusual, they knew, but right on the Kiowa Fault—could
 be.


 Labor Day crowds read the scientific conjectures with late summer
 lassitude. Sunday supplements ran four-color artists' conceptions of
 the possible volcano. ""Only Active Volcano in U. S.?"" demanded the
 headlines, and some papers even left off the question mark.


 It may seem odd that the simplest explanation was practically not
 mentioned. Only Joseph Schwartzberg, head geographer of the Department
 of the Interior, wondered if the disturbance might not be a settling
 of the Kiowa Fault. His suggestion was mentioned on page nine or ten
 of the Monday newspapers (page 27 of the New York
Times
). The idea
 was not nearly so exciting as a volcano, even a lava-less one, and you
 couldn't draw a very dramatic picture of it.


 To excuse the other geologists, it must be said that the Kiowa Fault
 had never acted up before. It never sidestepped, never jiggled,
 never, never produced the regular shows of its little sister out in
 California, which almost daily bounced San Francisco or Los Angeles, or
 some place in between. The dust volcano was on the face of it a more
 plausible theory.


 Still, it was only a theory. It had to be proved. As the tremors grew
 bigger, along with the affected area, as several towns including
 Edison were shaken to pieces by incredible earthquakes, whole bus- and
 plane-loads of geologists set out for Colorado, without even waiting
 for their university and government department to approve budgets.


 They found, of course, that Schwartzberg had been perfectly correct.
They found themselves on the scene of what was fast becoming the
 most violent and widespread earthquake North America—probably the
 world—has ever seen in historic times. To describe it in the simplest
 terms, land east of the Fault was settling, and at a precipitous rate.


 Rock scraped rock with a whining roar. Shuddery as a squeaky piece of
 chalk raked across a blackboard, the noise was deafening. The surfaces
 of the land east and west of the Fault seemed no longer to have any
 relation to each other. To the west, tortured rock reared into cliffs.
 East, where sharp reports and muffled wheezes told of continued
 buckling and dropping, the earth trembled downward. Atop the new
 cliffs, which seemed to grow by sudden inches from heaving rubble, dry
 earth fissured and trembled, sliding acres at a time to fall, smoking,
 into the bucking, heaving bottom of the depression.


 There the devastation was even more thorough, if less spectacular.
 Dry earth churned like mud, and rock shards weighing tons bumped and
 rolled about like pebbles as they shivered and cracked into pebbles
 themselves. ""It looks like sand dancing in a child's sieve,"" said the
 normally impassive Schwartzberg in a nationwide broadcast from the
 scene of disaster. ""No one here has ever seen anything like it."" And
 the landslip was growing, north and south along the Fault.


 ""Get out while you can,"" Schwartzberg urged the population of the
 affected area. ""When it's over you can come back and pick up the
 pieces."" But the band of scientists who had rallied to his leadership
 privately wondered if there would be any pieces.


 The Arkansas River, at Avondale and North Avondale, was sluggishly
 backing north into the deepening trough. At the rate things were going,
 there might be a new lake the entire length of El Paso and Pueblo
 Counties. And, warned Schwartzberg, this might only be the beginning.


 By 16 September the landslip had crept down the Huerfano River past
 Cedarwood. Avondale, North Avondale and Boone had totally disappeared.
 Land west of the Fault was holding firm, though Denver had recorded
 several small tremors; everywhere east of the Fault, to almost twenty
 miles away, the now-familiar lurch and steady fall had already sent
 several thousand Coloradans scurrying for safety.


 All mountain climbing was prohibited on the Eastern Slope because of
 the danger of rock slides from minor quakes. The geologists went home
 to wait.


 There wasn't much to wait for. The news got worse and worse. The Platte
 River, now, was creating a vast mud puddle where the town of Orchard
 had been. Just below Masters, Colorado, the river leaped 70-foot cliffs
 to add to the heaving chaos below. And the cliffs were higher every day
 as the land beneath them groaned downward in mile-square gulps.


 As the Fault moved north and south, new areas quivered into unwelcome
 life. Fields and whole mountainsides moved with deceptive sloth down,
 down. They danced ""like sand in a sieve""; dry, they boiled into rubble.
 Telephone lines, railroad tracks, roads snapped and simply disappeared.
 Virtually all east-west land communication was suspended and the
 President declared a national emergency.
By 23 September the Fault was active well into Wyoming on the north,
 and rapidly approaching the border of New Mexico to the south.
 Trinchera and Branson were totally evacuated, but even so the over-all
 death toll had risen above 1,000.


 Away to the east the situation was quiet but even more ominous.
 Tremendous fissures opened up perpendicular to the Fault, and a general
 subsidence of the land was noticeable well into Kansas and Nebraska.
 The western borders of these states, and soon of the Dakotas and
 Oklahoma as well, were slowly sinking.


 On the actual scene of the disaster (or the
scenes
; it is impossible
 to speak of anything this size in the singular) there was a horrifying
 confusion. Prairie and hill cracked open under intolerable strains as
 the land shuddered downward in gasps and leaps. Springs burst to the
 surface in hot geysers and explosions of steam.


 The downtown section of North Platte, Nebraska, dropped eight feet,
 just like that, on the afternoon of 4 October. ""We must remain calm,""
 declared the Governor of Nebraska. ""We must sit this thing out. Be
 assured that everything possible is being done."" But what could be
 done, with his state dropping straight down at a mean rate of a foot a
 day?


 The Fault nicked off the south-east corner of Montana. It worked its
 way north along the Little Missouri. South, it ripped past Roswell, New
 Mexico, and tore down the Pecos toward Texas. All the upper reaches of
 the Missouri were standing puddles by now, and the Red River west of
 Paris, Texas, had begun to run backward.


 Soon the Missouri began slowly slipping away westward over the slowly
 churning land. Abandoning its bed, the river spread uncertainly across
 farmland and prairie, becoming a sea of mud beneath the sharp new
 cliffs which rose in rending line, ever taller as the land continued to
 sink, almost from Canada to the Mexican border. There were virtually no
 floods, in the usual sense. The water moved too slowly, spread itself
 with no real direction or force. But the vast sheets of sluggish water
 and jelly-like mud formed death-traps for the countless refugees now
 streaming east.


 Perhaps the North Platte disaster had been more than anyone could take.
 193 people had died in that one cave-in. Certainly by 7 October it had
 to be officially admitted that there was an exodus of epic proportion.
 Nearly two million people were on the move, and the U. S. was faced
 with a gigantic wave of refugees. Rails, roads and air-lanes were
 jammed with terrified hordes who had left everything behind to crowd
 eastward.


 All through October hollow-eyed motorists flocked into Tulsa, Topeka,
 Omaha, Sioux Falls and Fargo. St. Louis was made distributing center
 for emergency squads which flew everywhere with milk for babies and
 dog food for evacuating pets. Gasoline trucks boomed west to meet the
 demand for gas, but once inside the ""zone of terror,"" as the newspapers
 now called it, they found their route blocked by eastbound cars on the
 wrong side of the road. Shops left by their fleeing owners were looted
 by refugees from further west; an American Airlines plane was wrecked
 by a mob of would-be passengers in Bismarck, North Dakota. Federal and
 State troops were called out, but moving two million people was not to
 be done in an orderly way.


 And still the landslip grew larger. The new cliffs gleamed in the
 autumn sunshine, growing higher as the land beneath them continued its
 inexorable descent.


 On 21 October, at Lubbock, Texas, there was a noise variously described
 as a hollow roar, a shriek and a deep musical vibration like a church
 bell. It was simply the tortured rock of the substrata giving way. The
 second phase of the national disaster was beginning.
The noise traveled due east at better than 85 miles per hour. In its
 wake the earth to the north ""just seemed to collapse on itself like
 a punctured balloon,"" read one newspaper report. ""Like a cake that's
 failed,"" said a Texarkana housewife who fortunately lived a block
south
of Thayer Street, where the fissure raced through. There
 was a sigh and a great cloud of dust, and Oklahoma subsided at the
 astounding rate of about six feet per hour.


 At Biloxi, on the Gulf, there had been uneasy shufflings under foot all
 day. ""Not tremors, exactly,"" said the captain of a fishing boat which
 was somehow to ride out the coming flood, ""but like as if the land
 wanted to be somewhere else.""


 Everyone in doomed Biloxi would have done well to have been somewhere
 else that evening. At approximately 8:30 p.m. the town shuddered,
 seemed to rise a little like the edge of a hall carpet caught in a
 draft, and sank. So did the entire Mississippi and Alabama coast, at
 about the same moment. The tidal wave which was to gouge the center
 from the U. S. marched on the land.
From the north shore of Lake Ponchartrain to the Appalachicola River
 in Florida, the Gulf coast simply disappeared. Gulfport, Biloxi,
 Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City: 200 miles of shoreline vanished, with
 over two and a half million people. An hour later a wall of water
 had swept over every town from Dothan, Alabama, to Bogalusa on the
 Louisiana-Mississippi border.


 ""We must keep panic from our minds,"" said the Governor of Alabama in a
 radio message delivered from a hastily arranged all-station hookup. ""We
 of the gallant southland have faced and withstood invasion before.""
 Then, as ominous creakings and groanings of the earth announced the
 approach of the tidal wave, he flew out of Montgomery half an hour
 before the town disappeared forever.


 One head of the wave plunged north, eventually to spend itself in
 the hills south of Birmingham. The main sweep followed the lowest
 land. Reaching west, it swallowed Vicksburg and nicked the corner of
 Louisiana. The whole of East Carroll Parish was scoured from the map.


 The Mississippi River now ended at about Eudora, Arkansas, and minute
 by minute the advancing flood bit away miles of river bed, swelling
 north. Chicot, Jennie, Lake Village, Arkansas City, Snow Lake, Elaine,
 Helena and Memphis felt the tremors. The tormented city shuddered
 through the night. The earth continued its descent, eventually tipping
 2-1/2 degrees down to the west. The ""Memphis Tilt"" is today one of
 the unique and charming characteristics of the gracious Old Town, but
 during the night of panic Memphis residents were sure they were doomed.
South and west the waters carved deeply into Arkansas and Oklahoma.
 By morning it was plain that all of Arkansas was going under. Waves
 advanced on Little Rock at almost 100 miles an hour, new crests
 forming, overtopping the wave's leading edge as towns, hills and the
 thirst of the soil temporarily broke the furious charge.


 Washington announced the official hope that the Ozarks would stop the
 wild gallop of the unleashed Gulf, for in northwest Arkansas the land
 rose to over 2,000 feet. But nothing could save Oklahoma. By noon the
 water reached clutching fingers around Mt. Scott and Elk Mountain,
 deluging Hobart and almost all of Greer County.


 Despite hopeful announcements that the wave was slowing, had virtually
 stopped after inundating Oklahoma City, was being swallowed up in the
 desert near Amarillo, the wall of water continued its advance. For the
 land was still sinking, and the floods were constantly replenished from
 the Gulf. Schwartzberg and his geologists advised the utmost haste in
 evacuating the entire area between Colorado and Missouri, from Texas to
 North Dakota.


 Lubbock, Texas, went under. On a curling reflex the tidal wave blotted
 out Sweetwater and Big Spring. The Texas panhandle disappeared in one
 great swirl.


 Whirlpools opened. A great welter of smashed wood and human debris was
 sucked under, vomited up and pounded to pieces. Gulf-water crashed on
 the cliffs of New Mexico and fell back on itself in foam. Would-be
 rescuers on the cliffs along what had been the west bank of the Pecos
 River afterwards recalled the hiss and scream like tearing silk as
 the water broke furiously on the newly exposed rock. It was the most
 terrible sound they had ever heard.


 ""We couldn't hear any shouts, of course, not that far away and with all
 the noise,"" said Dan Weaver, Mayor of Carlsbad. ""But we knew there
 were people down there. When the water hit the cliffs, it was like a
 collision between two solid bodies. We couldn't see for over an hour,
 because of the spray.""
Salt spray.
The ocean had come to New Mexico.
The cliffs proved to be the only effective barrier against the westward
 march of the water, which turned north, gouging out lumps of rock and
 tumbling down blocks of earth onto its own back. In places scoops of
 granite came out like ice cream. The present fishing town of Rockport,
 Colorado, is built on a harbor created in such a way.


 The water had found its farthest westering. But still it poured north
 along the line of the original Fault. Irresistible fingers closed on
 Sterling, Colorado, on Sidney, Nebraska, on Hot Springs, South Dakota.
 The entire tier of states settled, from south to north, down to its
 eventual place of stability one thousand feet below the level of the
 new sea.


 Memphis was by now a seaport. The Ozarks, islands in a mad sea, formed
 precarious havens for half-drowned humanity. Waves bit off a corner of
 Missouri, flung themselves on Wichita. Topeka, Lawrence and Belleville
 were the last Kansas towns to disappear. The Governor of Kansas went
 down with his State.


 Daniel Bernd of Lincoln, Nebraska, was washed up half-drowned in a cove
 of the Wyoming cliffs, having been sucked from one end of vanished
 Nebraska to the other. Similar hair-breadth escapes were recounted on
 radio and television.


 Virtually the only people saved out of the entire population of Pierre,
 South Dakota were the six members of the Creeth family. Plucky Timothy
 Creeth carried and dragged his aged parents to the loft of their barn
 on the outskirts of town. His brother Geoffrey brought along the
 younger children and what provisions they could find—""Mostly a ham
 and about half a ton of vanilla cookies,"" he explained to his eventual
 rescuers. The barn, luckily collapsing in the vibrations as the waves
 bore down on them, became an ark in which they rode out the disaster.


 ""We must of played cards for four days straight,"" recalled genial
 Mrs. Creeth when she afterwards appeared on a popular television
 spectacular. Her rural good-humor undamaged by an ordeal few women can
 ever have been called on to face, she added, ""We sure wondered why
 flushes never came out right. Jimanettly, we'd left the king of hearts
 behind, in the rush!""


 But such lightheartedness and such happy endings were by no means
 typical. The world could only watch aghast as the water raced north
 under the shadow of the cliffs which occasionally crumbled, roaring,
 into the roaring waves. Day by day the relentless rush swallowed what
 had been dusty farmland, cities and towns.


 Some people were saved by the helicopters which flew mercy missions
 just ahead of the advancing waters. Some found safety in the peaks of
 western Nebraska and the Dakotas. But when the waters came to rest
 along what is roughly the present shoreline of our inland sea, it was
 estimated that over fourteen million people had lost their lives.


 No one could even estimate the damage to property; almost the entirety
 of eight states, and portions of twelve others, had simply vanished
 from the heart of the North American continent forever.
It was in such a cataclysmic birth that the now-peaceful Nebraska Sea
 came to America.


 Today, nearly one hundred years after the unprecedented—and happily
 unrepeated—disaster, it is hard to remember the terror and despair of
 those weeks in October and November, 1973. It is inconceivable to think
 of the United States without its beautiful and economically essential
 curve of interior ocean. Two-thirds as long as the Mediterranean,
 it graduates from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico through the
 equally blue waves of the Mississippi Bight, becoming cooler and
 greener north and west of the pleasant fishing isles of the Ozark
 Archipelago, finally shading into the gray-green chop of the Gulf of
 Dakota.


 What would the United States have become without the 5600-mile
 coastline of our inland sea? It is only within the last twenty years
 that any but the topmost layer of water has cleared sufficiently
 to permit a really extensive fishing industry. Mud still held in
 suspension by the restless waves will not precipitate fully even in our
 lifetimes. Even so, the commercial fisheries of Missouri and Wyoming
 contribute no small part to the nation's economy.
Who can imagine what the middle west must have been like before the
 amelioration of climate brought about by the proximity of a warm sea?
 The now-temperate state of Minnesota (to say nothing of the submerged
 Dakotas) must have been Siberian. From contemporary accounts Missouri,
 our second California, was unbelievably muggy, almost uninhabitable
 during the summer months. Our climate today, from Ohio and North
 Carolina to the rich fields of New Mexico and the orchards of Montana,
 is directly ameliorated by the marine heart of the continent.
Who today could imagine the United States without the majestic
 sea-cliffs in stately parade from New Mexico to Montana? The beaches
 of Wyoming, the American Riviera, where fruit trees grow almost to the
 water's edge? Or incredible Colorado, where the morning skier is the
 afternoon bather, thanks to the monorail connecting the highest peaks
 with the glistening white beaches?
Of course there have been losses to balance slightly these strong
 gains. The Mississippi was, before 1973, one of the great rivers of
 the world. Taken together with its main tributary, the Missouri, it
 vied favorably with such giant systems as the Amazon and the Ganges.
 Now, ending as it does at Memphis and drawing its water chiefly from
 the Appalachian Mountains, it is only a slight remnant of what it was.
 And though the Nebraska Sea today carries many times the tonnage of
 shipping in its ceaseless traffic, we have lost the old romance of
 river shipping. We may only guess what it was like when we look upon
 the Ohio and the truncated Mississippi.


 And transcontinental shipping is somewhat more difficult, with trucks
 and the freight-railroads obliged to take the sea-ferries across the
 Nebraska Sea. We shall never know what the United States was like with
 its numerous coast-to-coast highways busy with trucks and private
 cars. Still, the ferry ride is certainly a welcome break after days of
 driving, and for those who wish a glimpse of what it must have been
 like, there is always the Cross-Canada Throughway and the magnificent
 U. S. Highway 73 looping north through Minnesota and passing through
 the giant port of Alexis, North Dakota, shipping center for the wheat
 of Manitoba and crossroad of a nation.
The political situation has long been a thorny problem. Only tattered
 remnants of the eight submerged states remained after the flood, but
 none of them wanted to surrender its autonomy. The tiny fringe of
 Kansas seemed, for a time, ready to merge with contiguous Missouri,
 but following the lead of the Arkansas Forever faction, the remaining
 population decided to retain political integrity. This has resulted
 in the continuing anomaly of the seven ""fringe States"" represented
 in Congress by the usual two Senators each, though the largest of
 them is barely the size of Connecticut and all are economically
 indistinguishable from their neighboring states.


 Fortunately it was decided some years ago that Oklahoma, only one of
 the eight to have completely disappeared, could not in any sense be
 considered to have a continuing political existence. So, though there
 are still families who proudly call themselves Oklahomans, and the
 Oklahoma Oil Company continues to pump oil from its submerged real
 estate, the state has in fact disappeared from the American political
 scene.


 But this is by now no more than a petty annoyance, to raise a smile
 when the talk gets around to the question of State's Rights. Not even
 the tremendous price the country paid for its new sea—fourteen million
 dead, untold property destroyed—really offsets the asset we enjoy
 today. The heart of the continent, now open to the shipping of the
 world, was once dry and land-locked, cut off from the bustle of trade
 and the ferment of world culture.


 It would indeed seem odd to an American of the '50s or '60s of the last
 century to imagine sailors from the merchant fleets of every nation
 walking the streets of Denver, fresh ashore at Newport, only fifteen
 miles away. Or to imagine Lincoln, Fargo, Kansas City and Dallas as
 world ports and great manufacturing centers. Utterly beyond their ken
 would be Roswell, New Mexico; Benton, Wyoming; Westport, Missouri,
 and the other new ports of over a million inhabitants each which have
 developed on the new harbors of the inland sea.


 Unimaginable too would have been the general growth of population
 in the states surrounding the new sea. As the water tables rose and
 manufacturing and trade moved in to take advantage of the just-created
 axis of world communication, a population explosion was touched off of
 which we are only now seeing the diminution. This new westering is to
 be ranked with the first surge of pioneers which created the American
 west. But what a difference! Vacation paradises bloom, a new fishing
 industry thrives; her water road is America's main artery of trade, and
 fleets of all the world sail ... where once the prairie schooner made
 its laborious and dusty way west!

""It is rather unusual,"" Magnan said, ""to assign an officer of your rank
 to courier duty, but this is an unusual mission.""


 Retief sat relaxed and said nothing. Just before the silence grew
 awkward, Magnan went on.


 ""There are four planets in the group,"" he said. ""Two double planets,
 all rather close to an unimportant star listed as DRI-G 33987. They're
 called Jorgensen's Worlds, and in themselves are of no importance
 whatever. However, they lie deep in the sector into which the Soetti
 have been penetrating.


 ""Now—"" Magnan leaned forward and lowered his voice—""we have learned
 that the Soetti plan a bold step forward. Since they've met no
 opposition so far in their infiltration of Terrestrial space, they
 intend to seize Jorgensen's Worlds by force.""


 Magnan leaned back, waiting for Retief's reaction. Retief drew
 carefully on his cigar and looked at Magnan. Magnan frowned.


 ""This is open aggression, Retief,"" he said, ""in case I haven't made
 myself clear. Aggression on Terrestrial-occupied territory by an alien
 species. Obviously, we can't allow it.""


 Magnan drew a large folder from his desk.


 ""A show of resistance at this point is necessary. Unfortunately,
 Jorgensen's Worlds are technologically undeveloped areas. They're
 farmers or traders. Their industry is limited to a minor role in
 their economy—enough to support the merchant fleet, no more. The war
 potential, by conventional standards, is nil.""


 Magnan tapped the folder before him.


 ""I have here,"" he said solemnly, ""information which will change that
 picture completely."" He leaned back and blinked at Retief.
""All right, Mr. Councillor,"" Retief said. ""I'll play along; what's in
 the folder?""


 Magnan spread his fingers, folded one down.


 ""First,"" he said. ""The Soetti War Plan—in detail. We were fortunate
 enough to make contact with a defector from a party of renegade
 Terrestrials who've been advising the Soetti."" He folded another
 finger. ""Next, a battle plan for the Jorgensen's people, worked out by
 the Theory group."" He wrestled a third finger down. ""Lastly; an Utter
 Top Secret schematic for conversion of a standard anti-acceleration
 field into a potent weapon—a development our systems people have been
 holding in reserve for just such a situation.""


 ""Is that all?"" Retief said. ""You've still got two fingers sticking up.""


 Magnan looked at the fingers and put them away.


 ""This is no occasion for flippancy, Retief. In the wrong hands, this
 information could be catastrophic. You'll memorize it before you leave
 this building.""


 ""I'll carry it, sealed,"" Retief said. ""That way nobody can sweat it out
 of me.""


 Magnan started to shake his head.


 ""Well,"" he said. ""If it's trapped for destruction, I suppose—""


 ""I've heard of these Jorgensen's Worlds,"" Retief said. ""I remember an
 agent, a big blond fellow, very quick on the uptake. A wizard with
 cards and dice. Never played for money, though.""


 ""Umm,"" Magnan said. ""Don't make the error of personalizing this
 situation, Retief. Overall policy calls for a defense of these
 backwater worlds. Otherwise the Corps would allow history to follow its
 natural course, as always.""


 ""When does this attack happen?""


 ""Less than four weeks.""


 ""That doesn't leave me much time.""


 ""I have your itinerary here. Your accommodations are clear as far as
 Aldo Cerise. You'll have to rely on your ingenuity to get you the rest
 of the way.""


 ""That's a pretty rough trip, Mr. Councillor. Suppose I don't make it?""


 Magnan looked sour. ""Someone at a policy-making level has chosen to put
 all our eggs in one basket, Retief. I hope their confidence in you is
 not misplaced.""


 ""This antiac conversion; how long does it take?""


 ""A skilled electronics crew can do the job in a matter of minutes. The
 Jorgensens can handle it very nicely; every other man is a mechanic of
 some sort.""


 Retief opened the envelope Magnan handed him and looked at the tickets
 inside.


 ""Less than four hours to departure time,"" he said. ""I'd better not
 start any long books.""


 ""You'd better waste no time getting over to Indoctrination,"" Magnan
 said.


 Retief stood up. ""If I hurry, maybe I can catch the cartoon.""


 ""The allusion escapes me,"" Magnan said coldly. ""And one last word. The
 Soetti are patrolling the trade lanes into Jorgensen's Worlds; don't
 get yourself interned.""


 ""I'll tell you what,"" Retief said soberly. ""In a pinch, I'll mention
 your name.""


 ""You'll be traveling with Class X credentials,"" Magnan snapped. ""There
 must be nothing to connect you with the Corps.""


 ""They'll never guess,"" Retief said. ""I'll pose as a gentleman.""


 ""You'd better be getting started,"" Magnan said, shuffling papers.


 ""You're right,"" Retief said. ""If I work at it, I might manage a
 snootful by takeoff."" He went to the door. ""No objection to my checking
 out a needler, is there?""


 Magnan looked up. ""I suppose not. What do you want with it?""


 ""Just a feeling I've got.""


 ""Please yourself.""


 ""Some day,"" Retief said, ""I may take you up on that.""
II


 Retief put down the heavy travel-battered suitcase and leaned on the
 counter, studying the schedules chalked on the board under the legend
 ""ALDO CERISE—INTERPLANETARY."" A thin clerk in a faded sequined blouse
 and a plastic snakeskin cummerbund groomed his fingernails, watching
 Retief from the corner of his eye.


 Retief glanced at him.


 The clerk nipped off a ragged corner with rabbitlike front teeth and
 spat it on the floor.


 ""Was there something?"" he said.


 ""Two twenty-eight, due out today for the Jorgensen group,"" Retief said.
 ""Is it on schedule?""


 The clerk sampled the inside of his right cheek, eyed Retief. ""Filled
 up. Try again in a couple of weeks.""


 ""What time does it leave?""


 ""I don't think—""


 ""Let's stick to facts,"" Retief said. ""Don't try to think. What time is
 it due out?""


 The clerk smiled pityingly. ""It's my lunch hour,"" he said. ""I'll be
 open in an hour."" He held up a thumb nail, frowned at it.


 ""If I have to come around this counter,"" Retief said, ""I'll feed that
 thumb to you the hard way.""


 The clerk looked up and opened his mouth. Then he caught Retief's eye,
 closed his mouth and swallowed.


 ""Like it says there,"" he said, jerking a thumb at the board. ""Lifts in
 an hour. But you won't be on it,"" he added.


 Retief looked at him.


 ""Some ... ah ... VIP's required accommodation,"" he said. He hooked
 a finger inside the sequined collar. ""All tourist reservations were
 canceled. You'll have to try to get space on the Four-Planet Line ship
 next—""


 ""Which gate?"" Retief said.


 ""For ... ah...?""


 ""For the two twenty-eight for Jorgensen's Worlds,"" Retief said.


 ""Well,"" the clerk said. ""Gate 19,"" he added quickly. ""But—""


 Retief picked up his suitcase and walked away toward the glare sign
 reading
To Gates 16-30
.


 ""Another smart alec,"" the clerk said behind him.
Retief followed the signs, threaded his way through crowds, found a
 covered ramp with the number 228 posted over it. A heavy-shouldered man
 with a scarred jawline and small eyes was slouching there in a rumpled
 gray uniform. He put out a hand as Retief started past him.


 ""Lessee your boarding pass,"" he muttered.


 Retief pulled a paper from an inside pocket, handed it over.


 The guard blinked at it.


 ""Whassat?""


 ""A gram confirming my space,"" Retief said. ""Your boy on the counter
 says he's out to lunch.""


 The guard crumpled the gram, dropped it on the floor and lounged back
 against the handrail.


 ""On your way, bub,"" he said.


 Retief put his suitcase carefully on the floor, took a step and drove a
 right into the guard's midriff. He stepped aside as the man doubled and
 went to his knees.


 ""You were wide open, ugly. I couldn't resist. Tell your boss I sneaked
 past while you were resting your eyes."" He picked up his bag, stepped
 over the man and went up the gangway into the ship.


 A cabin boy in stained whites came along the corridor.


 ""Which way to cabin fifty-seven, son?"" Retief asked.


 ""Up there."" The boy jerked his head and hurried on. Retief made his way
 along the narrow hall, found signs, followed them to cabin fifty-seven.
 The door was open. Inside, baggage was piled in the center of the
 floor. It was expensive looking baggage.


 Retief put his bag down. He turned at a sound behind him. A tall,
 florid man with an expensive coat belted over a massive paunch stood in
 the open door, looking at Retief. Retief looked back. The florid man
 clamped his jaws together, turned to speak over his shoulder.


 ""Somebody in the cabin. Get 'em out."" He rolled a cold eye at Retief as
 he backed out of the room. A short, thick-necked man appeared.


 ""What are you doing in Mr. Tony's room?"" he barked. ""Never mind! Clear
 out of here, fellow! You're keeping Mr. Tony waiting.""


 ""Too bad,"" Retief said. ""Finders keepers.""


 ""You nuts?"" The thick-necked man stared at Retief. ""I said it's Mr.
 Tony's room.""


 ""I don't know Mr. Tony. He'll have to bull his way into other quarters.""


 ""We'll see about you, mister."" The man turned and went out. Retief
 sat on the bunk and lit a cigar. There was a sound of voices in
 the corridor. Two burly baggage-smashers appeared, straining at an
 oversized trunk. They maneuvered it through the door, lowered it,
 glanced at Retief and went out. The thick-necked man returned.


 ""All right, you. Out,"" he growled. ""Or have I got to have you thrown
 out?""


 Retief rose and clamped the cigar between his teeth. He gripped a
 handle of the brass-bound trunk in each hand, bent his knees and heaved
 the trunk up to chest level, then raised it overhead. He turned to the
 door.


 ""Catch,"" he said between clenched teeth. The trunk slammed against the
 far wall of the corridor and burst.


 Retief turned to the baggage on the floor, tossed it into the hall. The
 face of the thick-necked man appeared cautiously around the door jamb.


 ""Mister, you must be—""


 ""If you'll excuse me,"" Retief said, ""I want to catch a nap."" He flipped
 the door shut, pulled off his shoes and stretched out on the bed.
Five minutes passed before the door rattled and burst open.


 Retief looked up. A gaunt leathery-skinned man wearing white ducks, a
 blue turtleneck sweater and a peaked cap tilted raffishly over one eye
 stared at Retief.


 ""Is this the joker?"" he grated.


 The thick-necked man edged past him, looked at Retief and snorted,
 ""That's him, sure.""


 ""I'm captain of this vessel,"" the first man said. ""You've got two
 minutes to haul your freight out of here, buster.""


 ""When you can spare the time from your other duties,"" Retief said,
 ""take a look at Section Three, Paragraph One, of the Uniform Code.
 That spells out the law on confirmed space on vessels engaged in
 interplanetary commerce.""


 ""A space lawyer."" The captain turned. ""Throw him out, boys.""


 Two big men edged into the cabin, looking at Retief.


 ""Go on, pitch him out,"" the captain snapped.


 Retief put his cigar in an ashtray, and swung his feet off the bunk.


 ""Don't try it,"" he said softly.


 One of the two wiped his nose on a sleeve, spat on his right palm, and
 stepped forward, then hesitated.


 ""Hey,"" he said. ""This the guy tossed the trunk off the wall?""


 ""That's him,"" the thick-necked man called. ""Spilled Mr. Tony's
 possessions right on the deck.""


 ""Deal me out,"" the bouncer said. ""He can stay put as long as he wants
 to. I signed on to move cargo. Let's go, Moe.""


 ""You'd better be getting back to the bridge, Captain,"" Retief said.
 ""We're due to lift in twenty minutes.""


 The thick-necked man and the Captain both shouted at once. The
 Captain's voice prevailed.


 ""—twenty minutes ... uniform Code ... gonna do?""


 ""Close the door as you leave,"" Retief said.


 The thick-necked man paused at the door. ""We'll see you when you come
 out.""
III


 Four waiters passed Retief's table without stopping. A fifth leaned
 against the wall nearby, a menu under his arm.


 At a table across the room, the Captain, now wearing a dress uniform
 and with his thin red hair neatly parted, sat with a table of male
 passengers. He talked loudly and laughed frequently, casting occasional
 glances Retief's way.


 A panel opened in the wall behind Retief's chair. Bright blue eyes
 peered out from under a white chef's cap.


 ""Givin' you the cold shoulder, heh, Mister?""


 ""Looks like it, old-timer,"" Retief said. ""Maybe I'd better go join the
 skipper. His party seems to be having all the fun.""


 ""Feller has to be mighty careless who he eats with to set over there.""


 ""I see your point.""


 ""You set right where you're at, Mister. I'll rustle you up a plate.""


 Five minutes later, Retief cut into a thirty-two ounce Delmonico backed
 up with mushrooms and garlic butter.


 ""I'm Chip,"" the chef said. ""I don't like the Cap'n. You can tell him I
 said so. Don't like his friends, either. Don't like them dern Sweaties,
 look at a man like he was a worm.""


 ""You've got the right idea on frying a steak, Chip. And you've got the
 right idea on the Soetti, too,"" Retief said. He poured red wine into a
 glass. ""Here's to you.""


 ""Dern right,"" Chip said. ""Dunno who ever thought up broiling 'em.
 Steaks, that is. I got a Baked Alaska coming up in here for dessert.
 You like brandy in yer coffee?""


 ""Chip, you're a genius.""


 ""Like to see a feller eat,"" Chip said. ""I gotta go now. If you need
 anything, holler.""


 Retief ate slowly. Time always dragged on shipboard. Four days to
 Jorgensen's Worlds. Then, if Magnan's information was correct,
 there would be four days to prepare for the Soetti attack. It was a
 temptation to scan the tapes built into the handle of his suitcase. It
 would be good to know what Jorgensen's Worlds would be up against.


 Retief finished the steak, and the chef passed out the baked Alaska and
 coffee. Most of the other passengers had left the dining room. Mr. Tony
 and his retainers still sat at the Captain's table.


 As Retief watched, four men arose from the table and sauntered across
 the room. The first in line, a stony-faced thug with a broken ear, took
 a cigar from his mouth as he reached the table. He dipped the lighted
 end in Retief's coffee, looked at it, and dropped it on the tablecloth.


 The others came up, Mr. Tony trailing.


 ""You must want to get to Jorgensen's pretty bad,"" the thug said in a
 grating voice. ""What's your game, hick?""


 Retief looked at the coffee cup, picked it up.


 ""I don't think I want my coffee,"" he said. He looked at the thug. ""You
 drink it.""


 The thug squinted at Retief. ""A wise hick,"" he began.


 With a flick of the wrist, Retief tossed the coffee into the thug's
 face, then stood and slammed a straight right to the chin. The thug
 went down.


 Retief looked at Mr. Tony, still standing open-mouthed.


 ""You can take your playmates away now, Tony,"" he said. ""And don't
 bother to come around yourself. You're not funny enough.""


 Mr. Tony found his voice.


 ""Take him, Marbles!"" he growled.


 The thick-necked man slipped a hand inside his tunic and brought out a
 long-bladed knife. He licked his lips and moved in.


 Retief heard the panel open beside him.


 ""Here you go, Mister,"" Chip said. Retief darted a glance; a well-honed
 french knife lay on the sill.


 ""Thanks, Chip,"" Retief said. ""I won't need it for these punks.""


 Thick-neck lunged and Retief hit him square in the face, knocking him
 under the table. The other man stepped back, fumbling a power pistol
 from his shoulder holster.


 ""Aim that at me, and I'll kill you,"" Retief said.


 ""Go on, burn him!"" Mr. Tony shouted. Behind him, the captain appeared,
 white-faced.


 ""Put that away, you!"" he yelled. ""What kind of—""


 ""Shut up,"" Mr. Tony said. ""Put it away, Hoany. We'll fix this bum
 later.""


 ""Not on this vessel, you won't,"" the captain said shakily. ""I got my
 charter to consider.""


 ""Ram your charter,"" Hoany said harshly. ""You won't be needing it long.""


 ""Button your floppy mouth, damn you!"" Mr. Tony snapped. He looked at
 the man on the floor. ""Get Marbles out of here. I ought to dump the
 slob.""


 He turned and walked away. The captain signaled and two waiters came
 up. Retief watched as they carted the casualty from the dining room.


 The panel opened.


 ""I usta be about your size, when I was your age,"" Chip said. ""You
 handled them pansies right. I wouldn't give 'em the time o' day.""


 ""How about a fresh cup of coffee, Chip?"" Retief said.


 ""Sure, Mister. Anything else?""


 ""I'll think of something,"" Retief said. ""This is shaping up into one of
 those long days.""
""They don't like me bringing yer meals to you in yer cabin,"" Chip said.
 ""But the cap'n knows I'm the best cook in the Merchant Service. They
 won't mess with me.""


 ""What has Mr. Tony got on the captain, Chip?"" Retief asked.


 ""They're in some kind o' crooked business together. You want some more
 smoked turkey?""


 ""Sure. What have they got against my going to Jorgensen's Worlds?""


 ""Dunno. Hasn't been no tourists got in there fer six or eight months. I
 sure like a feller that can put it away. I was a big eater when I was
 yer age.""


 ""I'll bet you can still handle it, Old Timer. What are Jorgensen's
 Worlds like?""


 ""One of 'em's cold as hell and three of 'em's colder. Most o' the
 Jorgies live on Svea; that's the least froze up. Man don't enjoy eatin'
 his own cookin' like he does somebody else's.""


 ""That's where I'm lucky, Chip. What kind of cargo's the captain got
 aboard for Jorgensen's?""


 ""Derned if I know. In and out o' there like a grasshopper, ever few
 weeks. Don't never pick up no cargo. No tourists any more, like I says.
 Don't know what we even run in there for.""


 ""Where are the passengers we have aboard headed?""


 ""To Alabaster. That's nine days' run in-sector from Jorgensen's. You
 ain't got another one of them cigars, have you?""


 ""Have one, Chip. I guess I was lucky to get space on this ship.""


 ""Plenty o' space, Mister. We got a dozen empty cabins."" Chip puffed
 the cigar alight, then cleared away the dishes, poured out coffee and
 brandy.


 ""Them Sweaties is what I don't like,"" he said.


 Retief looked at him questioningly.


 ""You never seen a Sweaty? Ugly lookin' devils. Skinny legs, like a
 lobster; big chest, shaped like the top of a turnip; rubbery lookin'
 head. You can see the pulse beatin' when they get riled.""


 ""I've never had the pleasure,"" Retief said.


 ""You prob'ly have it perty soon. Them devils board us nigh ever trip
 out. Act like they was the Customs Patrol or somethin'.""


 There was a distant clang, and a faint tremor ran through the floor.


 ""I ain't superstitious ner nothin',"" Chip said. ""But I'll be
 triple-damned if that ain't them boarding us now.""


 Ten minutes passed before bootsteps sounded outside the door,
 accompanied by a clicking patter. The doorknob rattled, then a heavy
 knock shook the door.


 ""They got to look you over,"" Chip whispered. ""Nosy damn Sweaties.""


 ""Unlock it, Chip."" The chef opened the door.


 ""Come in, damn you,"" he said.


 A tall and grotesque creature minced into the room, tiny hoof-like
 feet tapping on the floor. A flaring metal helmet shaded the deep-set
 compound eyes, and a loose mantle flapped around the knobbed knees.
 Behind the alien, the captain hovered nervously.


 ""Yo' papiss,"" the alien rasped.


 ""Who's your friend, Captain?"" Retief said.


 ""Never mind; just do like he tells you.""


 ""Yo' papiss,"" the alien said again.


 ""Okay,"" Retief said. ""I've seen it. You can take it away now.""
""Don't horse around,"" the captain said. ""This fellow can get mean.""


 The alien brought two tiny arms out from the concealment of the mantle,
 clicked toothed pincers under Retief's nose.


 ""Quick, soft one.""


 ""Captain, tell your friend to keep its distance. It looks brittle, and
 I'm tempted to test it.""


 ""Don't start anything with Skaw; he can clip through steel with those
 snappers.""


 ""Last chance,"" Retief said. Skaw stood poised, open pincers an inch
 from Retief's eyes.


 ""Show him your papers, you damned fool,"" the captain said hoarsely. ""I
 got no control over Skaw.""
The alien clicked both pincers with a sharp report, and in the same
 instant Retief half-turned to the left, leaned away from the alien
 and drove his right foot against the slender leg above the bulbous
 knee-joint. Skaw screeched and floundered, greenish fluid spattering
 from the burst joint.


 ""I told you he was brittle,"" Retief said. ""Next time you invite pirates
 aboard, don't bother to call.""


 ""Jesus, what did you do! They'll kill us!"" the captain gasped, staring
 at the figure flopping on the floor.


 ""Cart poor old Skaw back to his boat,"" Retief said. ""Tell him to pass
 the word. No more illegal entry and search of Terrestrial vessels in
 Terrestrial space.""


 ""Hey,"" Chip said. ""He's quit kicking.""


 The captain bent over Skaw, gingerly rolled him over. He leaned close
 and sniffed.


 ""He's dead."" The captain stared at Retief. ""We're all dead men,"" he
 said. ""These Soetti got no mercy.""


 ""They won't need it. Tell 'em to sheer off; their fun is over.""


 ""They got no more emotions than a blue crab—""


 ""You bluff easily, Captain. Show a few guns as you hand the body back.
 We know their secret now.""


 ""What secret? I—""


 ""Don't be no dumber than you got to, Cap'n,"" Chip said. ""Sweaties die
 easy; that's the secret.""


 ""Maybe you got a point,"" the captain said, looking at Retief. ""All they
 got's a three-man scout. It could work.""


 He went out, came back with two crewmen. They hauled the dead alien
 gingerly into the hall.


 ""Maybe I can run a bluff on the Soetti,"" the captain said, looking back
 from the door. ""But I'll be back to see you later.""


 ""You don't scare us, Cap'n,"" Chip said. ""Him and Mr. Tony and all his
 goons. You hit 'em where they live, that time. They're pals o' these
 Sweaties. Runnin' some kind o' crooked racket.""


 ""You'd better take the captain's advice, Chip. There's no point in your
 getting involved in my problems.""


 ""They'd of killed you before now, Mister, if they had any guts. That's
 where we got it over these monkeys. They got no guts.""


 ""They act scared, Chip. Scared men are killers.""


 ""They don't scare me none."" Chip picked up the tray. ""I'll scout around
 a little and see what's goin' on. If the Sweaties figure to do anything
 about that Skaw feller they'll have to move fast; they won't try
 nothin' close to port.""


 ""Don't worry, Chip. I have reason to be pretty sure they won't do
 anything to attract a lot of attention in this sector just now.""


 Chip looked at Retief. ""You ain't no tourist, Mister. I know that much.
 You didn't come out here for fun, did you?""


 ""That,"" Retief said, ""would be a hard one to answer.""
IV


 Retief awoke at a tap on his door.


 ""It's me, Mister. Chip.""


 ""Come on in.""


 The chef entered the room, locking the door.


 ""You shoulda had that door locked."" He stood by the door, listening,
 then turned to Retief.


 ""You want to get to Jorgensen's perty bad, don't you, Mister?""


 ""That's right, Chip.""


 ""Mr. Tony give the captain a real hard time about old Skaw. The
 Sweaties didn't say nothin'. Didn't even act surprised, just took the
 remains and pushed off. But Mr. Tony and that other crook they call
 Marbles, they was fit to be tied. Took the cap'n in his cabin and
 talked loud at him fer half a hour. Then the cap'n come out and give
 some orders to the Mate.""


 Retief sat up and reached for a cigar.


 ""Mr. Tony and Skaw were pals, eh?""


 ""He hated Skaw's guts. But with him it was business. Mister, you got a
 gun?""


 ""A 2mm needler. Why?""


 ""The orders cap'n give was to change course fer Alabaster. We're
 by-passin' Jorgensen's Worlds. We'll feel the course change any minute.""


 Retief lit the cigar, reached under the mattress and took out a
 short-barreled pistol. He dropped it in his pocket, looked at Chip.


 ""Maybe it was a good thought, at that. Which way to the Captain's
 cabin?""
""This is it,"" Chip said softly. ""You want me to keep an eye on who
 comes down the passage?""


 Retief nodded, opened the door and stepped into the cabin. The captain
 looked up from his desk, then jumped up.


 ""What do you think you're doing, busting in here?""


 ""I hear you're planning a course change, Captain.""


 ""You've got damn big ears.""


 ""I think we'd better call in at Jorgensen's.""


 ""You do, huh?"" the captain sat down. ""I'm in command of this vessel,""
 he said. ""I'm changing course for Alabaster.""


 ""I wouldn't find it convenient to go to Alabaster,"" Retief said. ""So
 just hold your course for Jorgensen's.""


 ""Not bloody likely.""


 ""Your use of the word 'bloody' is interesting, Captain. Don't try to
 change course.""


 The captain reached for the mike on his desk, pressed the key.


 ""Power Section, this is the captain,"" he said. Retief reached across
 the desk, gripped the captain's wrist.


 ""Tell the mate to hold his present course,"" he said softly.


 ""Let go my hand, buster,"" the captain snarled. Eyes on Retief's, he
 eased a drawer open with his left hand, reached in. Retief kneed the
 drawer. The captain yelped and dropped the mike.


 ""You busted it, you—""


 ""And one to go,"" Retief said. ""Tell him.""


 ""I'm an officer of the Merchant Service!""


 ""You're a cheapjack who's sold his bridge to a pack of back-alley
 hoods.""


 ""You can't put it over, hick.""


 ""Tell him.""


 The captain groaned and picked up the mike. ""Captain to Power Section,""
 he said. ""Hold your present course until you hear from me."" He dropped
 the mike and looked up at Retief.


 ""It's eighteen hours yet before we pick up Jorgensen Control. You going
 to sit here and bend my arm the whole time?""


 Retief released the captain's wrist and turned to the door.


 ""Chip, I'm locking the door. You circulate around, let me know what's
 going on. Bring me a pot of coffee every so often. I'm sitting up with
 a sick friend.""


 ""Right, Mister. Keep an eye on that jasper; he's slippery.""


 ""What are you going to do?"" the captain demanded.


 Retief settled himself in a chair.


 ""Instead of strangling you, as you deserve,"" he said, ""I'm going to
 stay here and help you hold your course for Jorgensen's Worlds.""


 The captain looked at Retief. He laughed, a short bark.


 ""Then I'll just stretch out and have a little nap, farmer. If you feel
 like dozing off sometime during the next eighteen hours, don't mind me.""


 Retief took out the needler and put it on the desk before him.


 ""If anything happens that I don't like,"" he said, ""I'll wake you up.
 With this.""

Slate,"Boys Do Bleed 

         Fight Club is silly stuff, sensationalism that mistakes itself for satire, but it's also a brash and transporting piece of moviemaking, like Raging Bull on acid. The film opens with--literally--a surge of adrenalin, which travels through the bloodstream and into the brain of its protagonist, Jack (Edward Norton), who's viewed, as the camera pulls out of his insides, with a gun stuck in his mouth. How'd he get into this pickle? He's going to tell you, breezily, and the director, David Fincher, is going to illustrate his narrative--violently. Fincher ( Seven , 1995; The Game , 1997) is out to bombard you with so much feverish imagery that you have no choice but to succumb to the movie's reeling, punch-drunk worldview. By the end, you might feel as if you, too, have a mouthful of blood. 

         Not to mention a hole in your head. Fight Club careers from one resonant satirical idea to the next without quite deciding whether its characters are full of crap or are Gen X prophets. It always gives you a rush, though. At first, it goofs on the absurd feminization of an absurdly macho culture. An increasingly desperate insomniac, Jack finds relief (and release) only at meetings for the terminally ill. At a testicular cancer group, he's enfolded in the ample arms of Bob (the singer Meat Loaf Aday), a former bodybuilder who ruined his health with steroids and now has ""bitch tits."" Jack and Bob subscribe to a new form of male bonding: They cling to each other and sob. But Jack's idyll is rudely disrupted by--wouldn't you know it?--a woman. A dark-eyed, sepulchral head case named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) begins showing up at all the same disparate meetings for essentially the same voyeuristic ends, and the presence of this ""tourist"" makes it impossible for Jack to emote. 

         Jack finds another outlet, though. On a plane, he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a cryptic hipster with a penchant for subversive acts both large (he makes high-priced soaps from liposuctioned human fat) and small (he splices frames from porn flicks into kiddie movies). When Jack's apartment mysteriously explodes--along with his carefully chosen IKEA furniture--he moves into Tyler's squalid warehouse and helps to found a new religion: Fight Club, in which young males gather after hours in the basement of a nightclub to pound one another (and be pounded) to a bloody pulp. That last parenthesis isn't so parenthetical. In some ways, it's the longing to be beaten into oblivion that's the strongest. ""Self-improvement,"" explains Tyler, ""is masturbation""; self-destruction is the new way. Tyler's manifesto calls for an end to consumerism (""Things you own end up owning you""), and since society is going down (""Martha Stewart is polishing brass on the Titanic ""), the only creative outlet left is annihilation. ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything,"" he says. 

         Fincher and his screenwriter, Jim Uhls, seem to think they've broken new ground in Fight                 Club , that their metaphor for our discontents hits harder than anyone else's. Certainly it produces more bloody splatter. But 20 years ago, the same impulse was called punk and, as Greil Marcus documents in Lipstick Traces , it was other things before that. Yes, the mixture of Johnny Rotten, Jake La Motta, and Jesus is unique; and the Faludi-esque emasculation themes are more explicit. But there's something deeply movie-ish about the whole conceit, as if the novelist and director were weaned on Martin Scorsese pictures and never stopped dreaming of recapturing that first masochistic rush. 

         The novel, the first by Chuck Palahniuk (the surname sounds like Eskimo for ""palooka""--which somehow fits), walks a line between the straight and ironic--it isn't always clear if its glib sociological pronouncements are meant to be taken straight or as the ravings of a delusional mama's boy. But onscreen, when Pitt announces to the assembled fighters that they are the ""middle children of history"" with ""no purpose and no place""--emasculated on one hand by the lack of a unifying crisis (a world war or depression) and on the other by lack of material wealth as promised by television--he seems meant to be intoning gospel. ""We are a generation of men raised by women,"" Tyler announces, and adds, ""If our fathers bail, what does that tell you about God?"" (I give up: What?) 

         F ight                 Club could use a few different perspectives: a woman's, obviously, but also an African-American's--someone who'd have a different take on the ""healing"" properties of violence. It's also unclear just what has emasculated Jack: Is it that he's a materialist or that the materials themselves (i.e., IKEA's lacquered particle boards) don't measure up to his fantasies of opulence? Is he motivated by spiritual hunger or envy? Tyler's subsequent idea of confining his group's mayhem to franchise coffee bars and corporate-subsidized art is a witty one--it's like a parody of neo-Nazism as re-enacted by yuppies. It might have been a howl if performed by, say, the troupe of artsy German nihilists in Joel and Ethan Coen's The Big Lebowski (1998). Somehow Brad Pitt doesn't have the same piquancy. 

         Actually, Pitt isn't as terrible as usual: He's playing not a character but a conceit, and he can bask in his movie-idol arrogance, which seems to be the most authentic emotion he has. But the film belongs to Norton. As a ferocious skinhead in last year's American History X , Norton was taut and ropy, his long torso curled into a sneer; here, he's skinny and wilting, a quivering pansy. Even when he fights he doesn't transform--he's a raging wimp. The performance is marvelous, and it makes poetic sense in light of the movie's climactic twist. But that twist will annoy more people than it will delight, if only because it shifts the drama from the realm of the sociological to that of the psychoanalytic. The finale, scored with the Pixies' great ""Where Is My Mind?"" comes off facetiously--as if Fincher is throwing the movie away. 

         Until then, however, he has done a fabulous job of keeping it spinning. The most thrilling thing about Fight Club isn't what it says but how Uhls and Fincher pull you into its narrator's head and simulate his adrenalin rushes. A veteran of rock videos, Fincher is one of those filmmakers who helps make the case that MTV--along with digital editing--has transformed cinema for better as well as worse. The syntax has become more intricate. Voice-over narration, once considered uncinematic, is back in style, along with novelistic asides, digressions, fantasies, and flashbacks. To make a point, you can jazzily interject anything--even, as in Three Kings , a shot of a bullet slicing through internal organs. Films like Fight Club might not gel, but they have a breathless, free-associational quality that points to new possibilities in storytelling. Or maybe old possibilities: The language of movies hasn't seemed this unfettered since the pre-sound days of Sergei Eisenstein and Abel Gance. 

         An actress named Hilary Swank gives one of the most rapturous performances I've ever seen as the cross-dressing Brandon Teena (a k a Teena Brandon) in Kimberly Peirce's stark and astonishingly beautiful debut feature,                    Boys Don't Cry                . The movie opens with Teena being shorn of her hated female tresses and becoming ""Brandon,"" who swaggers around in tight jeans and leather jackets. The joy is in watching the actor transform, and I don't just mean Swank: I mean Teena Brandon playing Brandon Teena--the role she has been longing for her whole life. In a redneck Nebraska bar, Brandon throws back a shot of whiskey and the gesture--a macho cliché--becomes an act of self-discovery. Every gesture does. ""You're gonna have a shiner in the morning,"" someone tells Brandon after a barroom brawl, and he takes the news with a glee that's almost mystical: ""I am????? Oh, shit!!!"" he cries, grinning. That might be my favorite moment in the picture, because Swank's ecstatic expression carries us through the next hour, as Brandon acts out his urban-cowboy fantasies--""surfing"" from the bumper of a pickup truck, rolling in the mud, and straddling a barstool with one hand on a brewski and the other on the shoulder of a gorgeous babe. 

         That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and into something more complex and irreducible: a meditation on the irrelevance of gender. Peirce's triumph is to make these scenes at once exuberant (occasionally hilarious) and foreboding, so that all the seeds of Brandon's killing are right there on the screen. John (Peter Sarsgaard), one of his future rapists and murderers, calls him ""little buddy"" and seems almost attracted to him; Sarsgaard's performance is a finely chiseled study of how unresolved emotion can suddenly resolve itself into violence. 

         Though harrowing, the second half of Boys Don't Cry isn't as great as the first. The early scenes evoke elation and dread simultaneously, the later ones just dread; and the last half-hour is unrelieved torture. What keeps the movie tantalizing is Chloë Sevigny's Lana, who might or might not know that Brandon is a girl but who's entranced by him anyway. With her lank hair, hooded eyes, and air of sleepy sensuality, Sevigny--maybe even more than Swank--embodies the mystery of sex that's at the core of Boys Don't Cry . Everything she does is deliberate, ironic, slightly unreadable--and unyielding. She's could be saying, ""I'm in this world but not of it. ... You'd never dream what's underneath."" 

         I n                 brief: If a friend tells you you'll love                    Happy Texas                , rethink the friendship. This clunky mistaken-identity comedy about escaped cons who impersonate gay pageant directors doesn't even make sense on its own low farcical terms; it's mostly one lame homo joke after another. The only bright spot is Steve Zahn, who could be the offspring of Michael J. Fox and Crispin Glover if they'd mated on the set of Back to the Future (1985). 

         It's hard to make a serious case for Lawrence Kasdan's                    Mumford                , which has apparently flopped but which you can still catch at second- and third-tier theaters. It looks peculiar--a Norman Rockwell painting with noir shadows. And its tale of a small town healed by a depressive (Loren Dean) posing as a psychologist is full of doddering misconceptions about psychotherapy. I almost don't know why I loved it, but the relaxed pacing and the witty turns by Martin Short, Ted Danson, David Paymer, and Mary McDonnell surely helped. I can't decide if the weirdly affectless Dean is inspired or inept, but my indecision suggests why he works in the role. There's no doubt, however, about his even more depressive love object, Hope Davis, who posseses the cinema's most expressive honking-nasal voice and who slumps through the movie like the world's most lyrical anti-ballerina. Even her puffy cheeks are eloquent: They made me think of Mumford as the home of the psychological mumps.

The
 wind howled out of
 the northwest, blind
 with snow and barbed
 with ice crystals. All
 the way up the half-mile
 precipice it fingered and wrenched
 away at groaning ice-slabs. It
 screamed over the top, whirled snow
 in a dervish dance around the hollow
 there, piled snow into the long furrow
 plowed ruler-straight through
 streamlined hummocks of snow.


 The sun glinted on black rock
 glazed by ice, chasms and ridges and
 bridges of ice. It lit the snow slope
 to a frozen glare, penciled black
 shadow down the long furrow, and
 flashed at the furrow's end on a
 thing of metal and plastics, an artifact
 thrown down in the dead wilderness.


 Nothing grew, nothing flew, nothing
 walked, nothing talked. But the
 thing in the hollow was stirring in
 stiff jerks like a snake with its back
 broken or a clockwork toy running
 down. When the movements stopped,
 there was a click and a strange
 sound began. Thin, scratchy, inaudible
 more than a yard away, weary
 but still cocky, there leaked from the
 shape in the hollow the sound of a
 human voice.


 ""I've tried my hands and arms
 and they seem to work,"" it began.
 ""I've wiggled my toes with entire
 success. It's well on the cards that
 I'm all in one piece and not broken
 up at all, though I don't see how it
 could happen. Right now I don't
 feel like struggling up and finding
 out. I'm fine where I am. I'll just lie
 here for a while and relax, and get
 some of the story on tape. This suit's
 got a built-in recorder, I might as
 well use it. That way even if I'm not
 as well as I feel, I'll leave a message.
 You probably know we're back
 and wonder what went wrong.


 ""I suppose I'm in a state of shock.
 That's why I can't seem to get up.
 Who wouldn't be shocked after luck
 like that?


 ""I've always been lucky, I guess.
 Luck got me a place in the
Whale
.
 Sure I'm a good astronomer but so
 are lots of other guys. If I were ten
 years older, it would have been an
 honor, being picked for the first long
 jump in the first starship ever. At my
 age it was luck.


 ""You'll want to know if the ship
 worked. Well, she did. Went like a
 bomb. We got lined up between
 Earth and Mars, you'll remember,
 and James pushed the button marked
 'Jump'. Took his finger off the button
 and there we were:
Alpha Centauri
.
 Two months later your time,
 one second later by us. We covered
 our whole survey assignment like
 that, smooth as a pint of old and
 mild which right now I could certainly
 use. Better yet would be a pint
 of hot black coffee with sugar in.
 Failing that, I could even go for a
 long drink of cold water. There was
 never anything wrong with the
Whale
till right at the end and even then I
 doubt if it was the ship itself that
 fouled things up.


 ""That was some survey assignment.
 We astronomers really lived.
 Wait till you see—but of course you
 won't. I could weep when I think of
 those miles of lovely color film, all
 gone up in smoke.
""I'm shocked all right. I never said
 who I was. Matt Hennessy, from Farside
 Observatory, back of the Moon,
 just back from a proving flight
cum
astronomical survey in the starship
Whale
. Whoever you are who finds
 this tape, you're made. Take it to
 any radio station or newspaper office.
 You'll find you can name your price
 and don't take any wooden nickels.


 ""Where had I got to? I'd told you
 how we happened to find Chang,
 hadn't I? That's what the natives called
 it. Walking, talking natives on a
 blue sky planet with 1.1 g gravity
 and a twenty per cent oxygen atmosphere
 at fifteen p.s.i. The odds
 against finding Chang on a six-sun
 survey on the first star jump ever
 must be up in the googols. We certainly
 were lucky.


 ""The Chang natives aren't very
 technical—haven't got space travel
 for instance. They're good astronomers,
 though. We were able to show
 them our sun, in their telescopes. In
 their way, they're a highly civilized
 people. Look more like cats than
 people, but they're people all right.
 If you doubt it, chew these facts
 over.


 ""One, they learned our language
 in four weeks. When I say they, I
 mean a ten-man team of them.


 ""Two, they brew a near-beer that's
 a lot nearer than the canned stuff we
 had aboard the
Whale
.


 ""Three, they've a great sense of
 humor. Ran rather to silly practical
 jokes, but still. Can't say I care for
 that hot-foot and belly-laugh stuff
 myself, but tastes differ.


 ""Four, the ten-man language team
 also learned chess and table tennis.


 ""But why go on? People who talk
 English, drink beer, like jokes and
 beat me at chess or table-tennis are
 people for my money, even if they
 look like tigers in trousers.


 ""It was funny the way they won
 all the time at table tennis. They certainly
 weren't so hot at it. Maybe
 that ten per cent extra gravity put us
 off our strokes. As for chess, Svendlov
 was our champion. He won
 sometimes. The rest of us seemed to
 lose whichever Chingsi we played.
 There again it wasn't so much that
 they were good. How could they be,
 in the time? It was more that we all
 seemed to make silly mistakes when
 we played them and that's fatal in
 chess. Of course it's a screwy situation,
 playing chess with something
 that grows its own fur coat, has yellow
 eyes an inch and a half long
 and long white whiskers. Could
you
have kept your mind on the game?


 ""And don't think I fell victim to
 their feline charm. The children were
 pets, but you didn't feel like patting
 the adults on their big grinning
 heads. Personally I didn't like the one
 I knew best. He was called—well, we
 called him Charley, and he was the
 ethnologist, ambassador, contact man,
 or whatever you like to call him, who
 came back with us. Why I disliked
 him was because he was always trying
 to get the edge on you. All the
 time he had to be top. Great sense
 of humor, of course. I nearly broke
 my neck on that butter-slide he fixed
 up in the metal alleyway to the
Whale's
engine room. Charley laughed
 fit to bust, everyone laughed, I
 even laughed myself though doing it
 hurt me more than the tumble had.
 Yes, life and soul of the party, old
 Charley ...


 ""My last sight of the
Minnow
was
 a cabin full of dead and dying men,
 the sweetish stink of burned flesh
 and the choking reek of scorching insulation,
 the boat jolting and shuddering
 and beginning to break up,
 and in the middle of the flames, still
 unhurt, was Charley. He was laughing ...


 ""My God, it's dark out here. Wonder
 how high I am. Must be all of
 fifty miles, and doing eight hundred
 miles an hour at least. I'll be doing
 more than that when I land. What's
 final velocity for a fifty-mile fall?
 Same as a fifty thousand mile fall, I
 suppose; same as escape; twenty-four
 thousand miles an hour. I'll make a
 mess ...
""That's better. Why didn't I close
 my eyes before? Those star streaks
 made me dizzy. I'll make a nice
 shooting star when I hit air. Come to
 think of it, I must be deep in air
 now. Let's take a look.


 ""It's getting lighter. Look at those
 peaks down there! Like great knives.
 I don't seem to be falling as fast as
 I expected though. Almost seem to be
 floating. Let's switch on the radio
 and tell the world hello. Hello, earth
 ... hello, again ... and good-by ...


 ""Sorry about that. I passed out. I
 don't know what I said, if anything,
 and the suit recorder has no playback
 or eraser. What must have happened
 is that the suit ran out of
 oxygen, and I lost consciousness due
 to anoxia. I dreamed I switched on
 the radio, but I actually switched on
 the emergency tank, thank the Lord,
 and that brought me round.


 ""Come to think of it, why not
 crack the suit and breath fresh air
 instead of bottled?


 ""No. I'd have to get up to do that.
 I think I'll just lie here a little bit
 longer and get properly rested up
 before I try anything big like standing
 up.


 ""I was telling about the return
 journey, wasn't I? The long jump
 back home, which should have dumped
 us between the orbits of Earth
 and Mars. Instead of which, when
 James took his finger off the button,
 the mass-detector showed nothing
 except the noise-level of the universe.


 ""We were out in that no place for
 a day. We astronomers had to establish
 our exact position relative to the
 solar system. The crew had to find
 out exactly what went wrong. The
 physicists had to make mystic passes
 in front of meters and mutter about
 residual folds in stress-free space.
 Our task was easy, because we were
 about half a light-year from the sun.
 The crew's job was also easy: they
 found what went wrong in less than
 half an hour.


 ""It still seems incredible. To program
 the ship for a star-jump, you
 merely told it where you were and
 where you wanted to go. In practical
 terms, that entailed first a series of
 exact measurements which had to be
 translated into the somewhat abstruse
 co-ordinate system we used based on
 the topological order of mass-points
 in the galaxy. Then you cut a tape on
 the computer and hit the button.
 Nothing was wrong with the computer.
 Nothing was wrong with the
 engines. We'd hit the right button
 and we'd gone to the place we'd aimed
 for. All we'd done was aim for
 the wrong place. It hurts me to tell
 you this and I'm just attached personnel
 with no space-flight tradition. In
 practical terms, one highly trained
 crew member had punched a wrong
 pattern of holes on the tape. Another
 equally skilled had failed to notice
 this when reading back. A childish
 error, highly improbable; twice repeated,
 thus squaring the improbability.
 Incredible, but that's what
 happened.


 ""Anyway, we took good care with
 the next lot of measurements. That's
 why we were out there so long. They
 were cross-checked about five times.
 I got sick so I climbed into a spacesuit
 and went outside and took some
 photographs of the Sun which I hoped
 would help to determine hydrogen
 density in the outer regions. When
 I got back everything was ready. We
 disposed ourselves about the control
 room and relaxed for all we were
 worth. We were all praying that this
 time nothing would go wrong, and
 all looking forward to seeing Earth
 again after four months subjective
 time away, except for Charley, who
 was still chuckling and shaking his
 head, and Captain James who was
 glaring at Charley and obviously
 wishing human dignity permitted him
 to tear Charley limb from limb. Then
 James pressed the button.


 ""Everything twanged like a bowstring.
 I felt myself turned inside out,
 passed through a small sieve, and
 poured back into shape. The entire
 bow wall-screen was full of Earth.
 Something was wrong all right, and
 this time it was much, much worse.
 We'd come out of the jump about
 two hundred miles above the Pacific,
 pointed straight down, traveling at a
 relative speed of about two thousand
 miles an hour.


 ""It was a fantastic situation. Here
 was the
Whale
, the most powerful
 ship ever built, which could cover
 fifty light-years in a subjective time
 of one second, and it was helpless.
 For, as of course you know, the
 star-drive couldn't be used again for
 at least two hours.


 ""The
Whale
also had ion rockets
 of course, the standard deuterium-fusion
 thing with direct conversion.
 As again you know, this is good for
 interplanetary flight because you can
 run it continuously and it has extremely
 high exhaust velocity. But in
 our situation it was no good because
 it has rather a low thrust. It would
 have taken more time than we had to
 deflect us enough to avoid a smash.
 We had five minutes to abandon
 ship.


 ""James got us all into the
Minnow
at a dead run. There was no time to
 take anything at all except the clothes
 we stood in. The
Minnow
was meant
 for short heavy hops to planets or
 asteroids. In addition to the ion drive
 it had emergency atomic rockets,
 using steam for reaction mass. We
 thanked God for that when Cazamian
 canceled our downwards velocity
 with them in a few seconds. We
 curved away up over China and from
 about fifty miles high we saw the
Whale
hit the Pacific. Six hundred
 tons of mass at well over two thousand
 miles an hour make an almighty
 splash. By now you'll have divers
 down, but I doubt they'll salvage
 much you can use.


 ""I wonder why James went down
 with the ship, as the saying is? Not
 that it made any difference. It must
 have broken his heart to know that
 his lovely ship was getting the chopper.
 Or did he suspect another human
 error?


 ""We didn't have time to think
 about that, or even to get the radio
 working. The steam rockets blew
 up. Poor Cazamian was burnt to a
 crisp. Only thing that saved me was
 the spacesuit I was still wearing. I
 snapped the face plate down because
 the cabin was filling with fumes. I
 saw Charley coming out of the toilet—that's
 how he'd escaped—and I
 saw him beginning to laugh. Then
 the port side collapsed and I fell out.


 ""I saw the launch spinning away,
 glowing red against a purplish black
 sky. I tumbled head over heels towards
 the huge curved shield of
 earth fifty miles below. I shut my
 eyes and that's about all I remember.
 I don't see how any of us could have
 survived. I think we're all dead.


 ""I'll have to get up and crack this
 suit and let some air in. But I can't.
 I fell fifty miles without a parachute.
 I'm dead so I can't stand up.""
There was silence for a while except
 for the vicious howl of the wind.
 Then snow began to shift on the
 ledge. A man crawled stiffly out and
 came shakily to his feet. He moved
 slowly around for some time. After
 about two hours he returned to the
 hollow, squatted down and switched
 on the recorder. The voice began
 again, considerably wearier.


 ""Hello there. I'm in the bleakest
 wilderness I've ever seen. This place
 makes the moon look cozy. There's
 precipice around me every way but
 one and that's up. So it's up I'll have
 to go till I find a way to go down.
 I've been chewing snow to quench
 my thirst but I could eat a horse. I
 picked up a short-wave broadcast on
 my suit but couldn't understand a
 word. Not English, not French, and
 there I stick. Listened to it for fifteen
 minutes just to hear a human voice
 again. I haven't much hope of reaching
 anyone with my five milliwatt
 suit transmitter but I'll keep trying.


 ""Just before I start the climb there
 are two things I want to get on tape.
 The first is how I got here. I've remembered
 something from my military
 training, when I did some parachute
 jumps. Terminal velocity for a
 human body falling through air is
 about one hundred twenty m.p.h.
 Falling fifty miles is no worse than
 falling five hundred feet. You'd be
 lucky to live through a five hundred
 foot fall, true, but I've been lucky.
 The suit is bulky but light and probably
 slowed my fall. I hit a sixty mile
 an hour updraft this side of the
 mountain, skidded downhill through
 about half a mile of snow and fetched
 up in a drift. The suit is part
 worn but still operational. I'm fine.


 ""The second thing I want to say is
 about the Chingsi, and here it is:
 watch out for them. Those jokers are
 dangerous. I'm not telling how because
 I've got a scientific reputation
 to watch. You'll have to figure it out
 for yourselves. Here are the clues:
(1) The Chingsi talk and laugh but
 after all they aren't human. On
 an alien world a hundred light-years
 away, why shouldn't alien
 talents develop? A talent that's
 so uncertain and rudimentary
 here that most people don't believe
 it, might be highly developed
 out there.
(2) The
Whale
expedition did fine
 till it found Chang. Then it hit
 a seam of bad luck. Real stinking
 bad luck that went on and
 on till it looks fishy. We lost
 the ship, we lost the launch, all
 but one of us lost our lives. We
 couldn't even win a game of
 ping-pong.


 ""So what is luck, good or bad?
 Scientifically speaking, future chance
 events are by definition chance. They
 can turn out favorable or not. When
 a preponderance of chance events has
 occurred unfavorably, you've got bad
 luck. It's a fancy name for a lot of
 chance results that didn't go your
 way. But the gambler defines it differently.
 For him, luck refers to the
 future, and you've got bad luck when
 future chance events won't go your
 way. Scientific investigations into this
 have been inconclusive, but everyone
 knows that some people are lucky and
 others aren't. All we've got are hints
 and glimmers, the fumbling touch of
 a rudimentary talent. There's the evil
 eye legend and the Jonah, bad luck
 bringers. Superstition? Maybe; but
 ask the insurance companies about
 accident prones. What's in a name?
 Call a man unlucky and you're superstitious.
 Call him accident prone and
 that's sound business sense. I've said
 enough.


 ""All the same, search the space-flight
 records, talk to the actuaries.
 When a ship is working perfectly
 and is operated by a hand-picked
 crew of highly trained men in perfect
 condition, how often is it wrecked
 by a series of silly errors happening
 one after another in defiance of
 probability?


 ""I'll sign off with two thoughts,
 one depressing and one cheering. A
 single Chingsi wrecked our ship and
 our launch. What could a whole
 planetful of them do?


 ""On the other hand, a talent that
 manipulates chance events is bound
 to be chancy. No matter how highly
 developed it can't be surefire. The
 proof is that I've survived to tell the
 tale.""
At twenty below zero and fifty
 miles an hour the wind ravaged the
 mountain. Peering through his polarized
 vizor at the white waste and the
 snow-filled air howling over it, sliding
 and stumbling with every step
 on a slope that got gradually steeper
 and seemed to go on forever, Matt
 Hennessy began to inch his way up
 the north face of Mount Everest.

When overwhelming danger is constantly present,of course
 
a man is entitled to have a bodyguard. The annoyance was that
 
he had to do it himself ... and his body would not cooperate!
The man at the bar was exceptionally handsome, and he knew it. So did
 the light-haired girl at his side, and so did the nondescript man in
 the gray suit who was watching them from a booth in the corner.


 Everyone in the room was aware of the big young man, and most of the
 humans present were resentful, for he handled himself consciously and
 arrogantly, as if his appearance alone were enough to make him superior
 to anyone. Even the girl with him was growing restless, for she was
 accustomed to adulation herself, and next to Gabriel Lockard she was
 almost ordinary-looking.


 As for the extraterrestrials—it was a free bar—they were merely
 amused, since to them all men were pathetically and irredeemably
 hideous.


 Gabe threw his arm wide in one of his expansive gestures. There was a
 short man standing next to the pair—young, as most men and women were
 in that time, thanks to the science which could stave off decay, though
 not death—but with no other apparent physical virtue, for plastic
 surgery had not fulfilled its bright promise of the twentieth century.


 The drink he had been raising to his lips splashed all over his
 clothing; the glass shattered at his feet. Now he was not only a rather
 ugly little man, but also a rather ridiculous one—or at least he felt
 he was, which was what mattered.


 ""Sorry, colleague,"" Gabe said lazily. ""All my fault. You must let me
 buy you a replacement."" He gestured to the bartender. ""Another of the
 same for my fellow-man here.""


 The ugly man dabbed futilely at his dripping trousers with a cloth
 hastily supplied by the management.


 ""You must allow me to pay your cleaning bill,"" Gabe said, taking out
 his wallet and extracting several credit notes without seeming to look
 at them. ""Here, have yourself a new suit on me.""
You could use one
was implied.


 And that, coming on top of Gabriel Lockard's spectacular appearance,
 was too much. The ugly man picked up the drink the bartender had just
 set before him and started to hurl it, glass and all, into Lockard's
 handsome face.
Suddenly a restraining hand was laid upon his arm. ""Don't do that,"" the
 nondescript man who had been sitting in the corner advised. He removed
 the glass from the little man's slackening grasp. ""You wouldn't want to
 go to jail because of him.""


 The ugly man gave him a bewildered stare. Then, seeing the forces
 now ranged against him—including his own belated prudence—were too
 strong, he stumbled off. He hadn't really wanted to fight, only to
 smash back, and now it was too late for that.


 Gabe studied the newcomer curiously. ""So, it's you again?""


 The man in the gray suit smiled. ""Who else in any world would stand up
 for you?""


 ""I should think you'd have given up by now. Not that I mind having you
 around, of course,"" Gabriel added too quickly. ""You do come in useful
 at times, you know.""


 ""So you don't mind having me around?"" The nondescript man smiled again.
 ""Then what are you running from, if not me? You can't be running from
 yourself—you lost yourself a while back, remember?""


 Gabe ran a hand through his thick blond hair. ""Come on, have a drink
 with me, fellow-man, and let's let bygones be bygones. I owe you
 something—I admit that. Maybe we can even work this thing out.""


 ""I drank with you once too often,"" the nondescript man said. ""And
 things worked out fine, didn't they? For you."" His eyes studied the
 other man's incredibly handsome young face, noted the suggestion of
 bags under the eyes, the beginning of slackness at the lips, and were
 not pleased with what they saw. ""Watch yourself, colleague,"" he warned
 as he left. ""Soon you might not be worth the saving.""


 ""Who was that, Gabe?"" the girl asked.


 He shrugged. ""I never saw him before in my life."" Of course, knowing
 him, she assumed he was lying, but, as a matter of fact, just then he
 happened to have been telling the truth.
Once the illuminators were extinguished in Gabriel Lockard's hotel
 suite, it seemed reasonably certain to the man in the gray suit, as
 he watched from the street, that his quarry would not go out again
 that night. So he went to the nearest airstation. There he inserted a
 coin in a locker, into which he put most of his personal possessions,
 reserving only a sum of money. After setting the locker to respond to
 the letter combination
bodyguard
, he went out into the street.


 If he had met with a fatal accident at that point, there would have
 been nothing on his body to identify him. As a matter of fact, no real
 identification was possible, for he was no one and had been no one for
 years.


 The nondescript man hailed a cruising helicab. ""Where to, fellow-man?""
 the driver asked.


 ""I'm new in the parish,"" the other man replied and let it hang there.


 ""Oh...? Females...? Narcophagi...? Thrill-mills?""


 But to each of these questions the nondescript man shook his head.


 ""Games?"" the driver finally asked, although he could guess what was
 wanted by then. ""Dice...? Roulette...? Farjeen?""


 ""Is there a good zarquil game in town?""


 The driver moved so he could see the face of the man behind him in the
 teleview. A very ordinary face. ""Look, colleague, why don't you commit
 suicide? It's cleaner and quicker.""


 ""I can't contact your attitude,"" the passenger said with a thin
 smile. ""Bet you've never tried the game yourself. Each time it
 happens, there's a ... well, there's no experience to match it at a
 thrill-mill."" He gave a sigh that was almost an audible shudder, and
 which the driver misinterpreted as an expression of ecstasy.


 ""Each time, eh? You're a dutchman then?"" The driver spat out of the
 window. ""If it wasn't for the nibble, I'd throw you right out of the
 cab. Without even bothering to take it down even. I hate dutchmen ...
 anybody with any legitimate feelings hates 'em.""


 ""But it would be silly to let personal prejudice stand in the way of a
 commission, wouldn't it?"" the other man asked coolly.


 ""Of course. You'll need plenty of foliage, though.""


 ""I have sufficient funds. I also have a gun.""


 ""You're the dictator,"" the driver agreed sullenly.
II


 It was a dark and rainy night in early fall. Gabe Lockard was in no
 condition to drive the helicar. However, he was stubborn.


 ""Let me take the controls, honey,"" the light-haired girl urged, but he
 shook his handsome head.


 ""Show you I can do something 'sides look pretty,"" he said thickly,
 referring to an earlier and not amicable conversation they had held,
 and of which she still bore the reminder on one thickly made-up cheek.


 Fortunately the car was flying low, contrary to regulations, so that
 when they smashed into the beacon tower on the outskirts of the little
 town, they didn't have far to fall. And hardly had their car crashed
 on the ground when the car that had been following them landed, and a
 short fat man was puffing toward them through the mist.


 To the girl's indignation, the stranger not only hauled Gabe out onto
 the dripping grass first, but stopped and deliberately examined the
 young man by the light of his minilume, almost as if she weren't there
 at all. Only when she started to struggle out by herself did he seem to
 remember her existence. He pulled her away from the wreck just a moment
 before the fuel tank exploded and the 'copter went up in flames.


 Gabe opened his eyes and saw the fat man gazing down at him
 speculatively. ""My guardian angel,"" he mumbled—shock had sobered him
 a little, but not enough. He sat up. ""Guess I'm not hurt or you'd have
 thrown me back in.""


 ""And that's no joke,"" the fat man agreed.


 The girl shivered and at that moment Gabriel suddenly seemed to recall
 that he had not been alone. ""How about Helen? She on course?""


 ""Seems to be,"" the fat man said. ""You all right, miss?"" he asked,
 glancing toward the girl without, she thought, much apparent concern.


 ""
Mrs.
,"" Gabriel corrected. ""Allow me to introduce you to Mrs. Gabriel
 Lockard,"" he said, bowing from his seated position toward the girl.
 ""Pretty bauble, isn't she?""


 ""I'm delighted to meet you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard,"" the fat man said,
 looking at her intently. His small eyes seemed to strip the make-up
 from her cheek and examine the livid bruise underneath. ""I hope
 you'll be worthy of the name."" The light given off by the flaming
 car flickered on his face and Gabriel's and, she supposed, hers too.
 Otherwise, darkness surrounded the three of them.


 There were no public illuminators this far out—even in town the
 lights were dimming and not being replaced fast enough nor by the
 newer models. The town, the civilization, the planet all were old and
 beginning to slide downhill....


 Gabe gave a short laugh, for no reason that she could see.
There was the feeling that she had encountered the fat man before,
 which was, of course, absurd. She had an excellent memory for faces and
 his was not included in her gallery. The girl pulled her thin jacket
 closer about her chilly body. ""Aren't you going to introduce your—your
 friend to me, Gabe?""


 ""I don't know who he is,"" Gabe said almost merrily, ""except that he's
 no friend of mine. Do you have a name, stranger?""


 ""Of course I have a name."" The fat man extracted an identification
 card from his wallet and read it. ""Says here I'm Dominic Bianchi, and
 Dominic Bianchi is a retail milgot dealer.... Only he isn't a retail
 milgot dealer any more; the poor fellow went bankrupt a couple of weeks
 ago, and now he isn't ... anything.""


 ""You saved our lives,"" the girl said. ""I'd like to give you some token
 of my—of our appreciation."" Her hand reached toward her credit-carrier
 with deliberate insult. He might have saved her life, but only
 casually, as a by-product of some larger scheme, and her appreciation
 held little gratitude.


 The fat man shook his head without rancor. ""I have plenty of money,
 thank you, Mrs. Gabriel Lockard.... Come,"" he addressed her husband,
 ""if you get up, I'll drive you home. I warn you, be more careful in the
 future! Sometimes,"" he added musingly, ""I almost wish you would let
 something happen. Then my problem would not be any problem, would it?""


 Gabriel shivered. ""I'll be careful,"" he vowed. ""I promise—I'll be
 careful.""
When he was sure that his charge was safely tucked in for the night,
 the fat man checked his personal possessions. He then requested a taxi
 driver to take him to the nearest zarquil game. The driver accepted the
 commission phlegmatically. Perhaps he was more hardened than the others
 had been; perhaps he was unaware that the fat man was not a desperate
 or despairing individual seeking one last chance, but what was known
 colloquially as a flying dutchman, a man, or woman, who went from
 one zarquil game to another, loving the thrill of the sport, if you
 could call it that, for its own sake, and not for the futile hope it
 extended and which was its sole shred of claim to moral justification.
 Perhaps—and this was the most likely hypothesis—he just didn't care.


 Zarquil was extremely illegal, of course—so much so that there were
 many legitimate citizens who weren't quite sure just what the word
 implied, knowing merely that it was one of those nameless horrors so
 deliciously hinted at by the fax sheets under the generic term of
 ""crimes against nature."" Actually the phrase was more appropriate to
 zarquil than to most of the other activities to which it was commonly
 applied. And this was one crime—for it was crime in law as well as
 nature—in which victim had to be considered as guilty as perpetrator;
 otherwise the whole legal structure of society would collapse.
Playing the game was fabulously expensive; it had to be to make it
 profitable for the Vinzz to run it. Those odd creatures from Altair's
 seventh planet cared nothing for the welfare of the completely alien
 human beings; all they wanted was to feather their own pockets with
 interstellar credits, so that they could return to Vinau and buy many
 slaves. For, on Vinau, bodies were of little account, and so to them
 zarquil was the equivalent of the terrestrial game musical chairs.
 Which was why they came to Terra to make profits—there has never been
 big money in musical chairs as such.


 When the zarquil operators were apprehended, which was not frequent—as
 they had strange powers, which, not being definable, were beyond the
 law—they suffered their sentences with equanimity. No Earth court
 could give an effective prison sentence to a creature whose life
 spanned approximately two thousand terrestrial years. And capital
 punishment had become obsolete on Terra, which very possibly saved the
 terrestrials embarrassment, for it was not certain that their weapons
 could kill the Vinzz ... or whether, in fact, the Vinzz merely expired
 after a period of years out of sheer boredom. Fortunately, because
 trade was more profitable than war, there had always been peace between
 Vinau and Terra, and, for that reason, Terra could not bar the entrance
 of apparently respectable citizens of a friendly planet.


 The taxi driver took the fat man to one of the rather seedy locales in
 which the zarquil games were usually found, for the Vinzz attempted to
 conduct their operations with as much unobtrusiveness as was possible.
 But the front door swung open on an interior that lacked the opulence
 of the usual Vinoz set-up; it was down-right shabby, the dim olive
 light hinting of squalor rather than forbidden pleasures. That was
 the trouble in these smaller towns—you ran greater risks of getting
 involved in games where the players had not been carefully screened.


 The Vinoz games were usually clean, because that paid off better, but,
 when profits were lacking, the Vinzz were capable of sliding off into
 darkside practices. Naturally the small-town houses were more likely to
 have trouble in making ends meet, because everybody in the parish knew
 everybody else far too well.


 The fat man wondered whether that had been his quarry's motive in
 coming to such desolate, off-trail places—hoping that eventually
 disaster would hit the one who pursued him. Somehow, such a plan seemed
 too logical for the man he was haunting.


 However, beggars could not be choosers. The fat man paid off the
 heli-driver and entered the zarquil house. ""One?"" the small green
 creature in the slightly frayed robe asked.


 ""One,"" the fat man answered.
III


 The would-be thief fled down the dark alley, with the hot bright rays
 from the stranger's gun lancing out after him in flamboyant but futile
 patterns. The stranger, a thin young man with delicate, angular
 features, made no attempt to follow. Instead, he bent over to examine
 Gabriel Lockard's form, appropriately outstretched in the gutter. ""Only
 weighted out,"" he muttered, ""he'll be all right. Whatever possessed you
 two to come out to a place like this?""


 ""I really think Gabriel
must
be possessed...."" the girl said, mostly
 to herself. ""I had no idea of the kind of place it was going to be
 until he brought me here. The others were bad, but this is even worse.
 It almost seems as if he went around looking for trouble, doesn't it?""


 ""It does indeed,"" the stranger agreed, coughing a little. It was
 growing colder and, on this world, the cities had no domes to protect
 them from the climate, because it was Earth and the air was breathable
 and it wasn't worth the trouble of fixing up.


 The girl looked closely at him. ""You look different, but you
are
the
 same man who pulled us out of that aircar crash, aren't you? And before
 that the man in the gray suit? And before that...?""


 The young man's cheekbones protruded as he smiled. ""Yes, I'm all of
 them.""


 ""Then what they say about the zarquil games is true? There are people
 who go around changing their bodies like—like hats?"" Automatically she
 reached to adjust the expensive bit of blue synthetic on her moon-pale
 hair, for she was always conscious of her appearance; if she had not
 been so before marriage, Gabriel would have taught her that.
He smiled again, but coughed instead of speaking.


 ""But why do you do it?
Why!
Do you like it? Or is it because of
 Gabriel?"" She was growing a little frantic; there was menace here
 and she could not understand it nor determine whether or not she was
 included in its scope. ""Do you want to keep him from recognizing you;
 is that it?""


 ""Ask him.""


 ""He won't tell me; he never tells me anything. We just keep running. I
 didn't recognize it as running at first, but now I realize that's what
 we've been doing ever since we were married. And running from you, I
 think?""


 There was no change of expression on the man's gaunt face, and she
 wondered how much control he had over a body that, though second- or
 third- or fourth-hand, must be new to him. How well could he make it
 respond? What was it like to step into another person's casing? But she
 must not let herself think that way or she would find herself looking
 for a zarquil game. It would be one way of escaping Gabriel, but not,
 she thought, the best way; her body was much too good a one to risk so
 casually.
It was beginning to snow. Light, feathery flakes drifted down on her
 husband's immobile body. She pulled her thick coat—of fur taken from
 some animal who had lived and died light-years away—more closely about
 herself. The thin young man began to cough again.


 Overhead a tiny star seemed to detach itself from the pale flat disk
 of the Moon and hurl itself upward—one of the interstellar ships
 embarking on its long voyage to distant suns. She wished that somehow
 she could be on it, but she was here, on this solitary old world in a
 barren solar system, with her unconscious husband and a strange man who
 followed them, and it looked as if here she would stay ... all three of
 them would stay....


 ""If you're after Gabriel, planning to hurt him,"" she asked, ""why then
 do you keep helping him?""


 ""I am not helping
him
. And he knows that.""


 ""You'll change again tonight, won't you?"" she babbled. ""You always
 change after you ... meet us? I think I'm beginning to be able to
 identify you now, even when you're ... wearing a new body; there's
 something about you that doesn't change.""


 ""Too bad he got married,"" the young man said. ""I could have followed
 him for an eternity and he would never have been able to pick me out
 from the crowd. Too bad he got married anyway,"" he added, his voice
 less impersonal, ""for your sake.""


 She had come to the same conclusion in her six months of marriage, but
 she would not admit that to an outsider. Though this man was hardly an
 outsider; he was part of their small family group—as long as she had
 known Gabriel, so long he must have known her. And she began to suspect
 that he was even more closely involved than that.


 ""Why must you change again?"" she persisted, obliquely approaching the
 subject she feared. ""You have a pretty good body there. Why run the
 risk of getting a bad one?""


 ""This isn't a good body,"" he said. ""It's diseased. Sure, nobody's
 supposed to play the game who hasn't passed a thorough medical
 examination. But in the places to which your husband has been leading
 me, they're often not too particular, as long as the player has plenty
 of foliage.""


 ""How—long will it last you?""


 ""Four or five months, if I'm careful."" He smiled. ""But don't worry, if
 that's what you're doing; I'll get it passed on before then. It'll be
 expensive—that's all. Bad landing for the guy who gets it, but then
 it was tough on me too, wasn't it?""


 ""But how did you get into this ... pursuit?"" she asked again. ""And why
 are you doing it?"" People didn't have any traffic with Gabriel Lockard
 for fun, not after they got to know him. And this man certainly should
 know him better than most.


 ""Ask your husband.""


 The original Gabriel Lockard looked down at the prostrate,
 snow-powdered figure of the man who had stolen his body and his name,
 and stirred it with his toe. ""I'd better call a cab—he might freeze to
 death.""


 He signaled and a cab came.


 ""Tell him, when he comes to,"" he said to the girl as he and the driver
 lifted the heavy form of her husband into the helicar, ""that I'm
 getting pretty tired of this."" He stopped for a long spell of coughing.
 ""Tell him that sometimes I wonder whether cutting off my nose wouldn't,
 in the long run, be most beneficial for my face.""
""Sorry,"" the Vinzz said impersonally, in English that was perfect
 except for the slight dampening of the sibilants, ""but I'm afraid you
 cannot play.""


 ""Why not?"" The emaciated young man began to put on his clothes.


 ""You know why. Your body is worthless. And this is a reputable house.""


 ""But I have plenty of money."" The young man coughed. The Vinzz
 shrugged. ""I'll pay you twice the regular fee.""


 The green one shook his head. ""Regrettably, I do mean what I say. This
 game is really clean.""


 ""In a town like this?""


 ""That is the reason we can afford to be honest."" The Vinzz' tendrils
 quivered in what the man had come to recognize as amusement through
 long, but necessarily superficial acquaintance with the Vinzz. His
 heavy robe of what looked like moss-green velvet, but might have been
 velvet-green moss, encrusted with oddly faceted alien jewels, swung
 with him.


 ""We do a lot of business here,"" he said unnecessarily, for the whole
 set-up spelled wealth far beyond the dreams of the man, and he was by
 no means poor when it came to worldly goods. ""Why don't you try another
 town where they're not so particular?""


 The young man smiled wryly. Just his luck to stumble on a sunny game.
 He never liked to risk following his quarry in the same configuration.
 And even though only the girl had actually seen him this time, he
 wouldn't feel at ease until he had made the usual body-shift. Was
 he changing because of Gabriel, he wondered, or was he using his own
 discoverment and identification simply as an excuse to cover the fact
 that none of the bodies that fell to his lot ever seemed to fit him?
 Was he activated solely by revenge or as much by the hope that in the
 hazards of the game he might, impossible though it now seemed, some day
 win another body that approached perfection as nearly as his original
 casing had?


 He didn't know. However, there seemed to be no help for it now; he
 would have to wait until they reached the next town, unless the girl,
 seeing him reappear in the same guise, would guess what had happened
 and tell her husband. He himself had been a fool to admit to her that
 the hulk he inhabited was a sick one; he still couldn't understand
 how he could so casually have entrusted her with so vital a piece of
 information.
The Vinzz had been locking antennae with another of his kind. Now they
 detached, and the first approached the man once more. ""There is, as it
 happens, a body available for a private game,"" he lisped. ""No questions
 to be asked or answered. All I can tell you is that it is in good
 health.""


 The man hesitated. ""But unable to pass the screening?"" he murmured
 aloud. ""A criminal then.""


 The green one's face—if you could call it a face—remained impassive.


 ""Male?""


 ""Of course,"" the Vinzz said primly. His kind did have certain ultimate
 standards to which they adhered rigidly, and one of those was the
 curious tabu against mixed games, strictly enforced even though it
 kept them from tapping a vast source of potential players. There had
 also never been a recorded instance of humans and extraterrestrials
 exchanging identities, but whether that was the result of tabu or
 biological impossibility, no one could tell.


 It might merely be prudence on the Vinzz' part—if it had ever
 been proved that an alien life-form had ""desecrated"" a human body,
 Earthmen would clamor for war ... for on this planet humanity held
 its self-bestowed purity of birthright dear—and the Vinzz, despite
 being unquestionably the stronger, were pragmatic pacifists. It had
 been undoubtedly some rabid member of the anti-alien groups active on
 Terra who had started the rumor that the planetary slogan of Vinau was,
 ""Don't beat 'em; cheat 'em.""


 ""It would have to be something pretty nuclear for the other guy to take
 such a risk."" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully. ""How much?""


 ""Thirty thousand credits.""


 ""Why, that's three times the usual rate!""


 ""The other will pay five times the usual rate.""


 ""Oh, all right,"" the delicate young man gave in. It was a terrific
 risk he was agreeing to take, because, if the other was a criminal, he
 himself would, upon assuming the body, assume responsibility for all
 the crimes it had committed. But there was nothing else he could do.
He looked at himself in the mirror and found he had a fine new body;
 tall and strikingly handsome in a dark, coarse-featured way. Nothing to
 match the one he had lost, in his opinion, but there were probably many
 people who might find this one preferable. No identification in the
 pockets, but it wasn't necessary; he recognized the face. Not that it
 was a very famous or even notorious one, but the dutchman was a careful
 student of the ""wanted"" fax that had decorated public buildings from
 time immemorial, for he was ever mindful of the possibility that he
 might one day find himself trapped unwittingly in the body of one of
 the men depicted there. And he knew that this particular man, though
 not an important criminal in any sense of the word, was one whom the
 police had been ordered to burn on sight. The abolishing of capital
 punishment could not abolish the necessity for self-defense, and the
 man in question was not one who would let himself be captured easily,
 nor whom the police intended to capture easily.
This might be a lucky break for me after all
, the new tenant thought,
 as he tried to adjust himself to the body. It, too, despite its obvious
 rude health, was not a very comfortable fit.
I can do a lot with a
 hulk like this. And maybe I'm cleverer than the original owner; maybe
 I'll be able to get away with it.

 ""Look, Gabe,"" the girl said, ""don't try to fool me! I know you
 too well. And I know you have that man's—the real Gabriel
 Lockard's—body."" She put unnecessary stardust on her nose as she
 watched her husband's reflection in the dressing table mirror.


 Lockard—Lockard's body, at any rate—sat up and felt his unshaven
 chin. ""That what he tell you?""


 ""No, he didn't tell me anything really—just suggested I ask you
 whatever I want to know. But why else should he guard somebody he
 obviously hates the way he hates you? Only because he doesn't want to
 see his body spoiled.""


 ""It
is
a pretty good body, isn't it?"" Gabe flexed softening muscles
 and made no attempt to deny her charge; very probably he was relieved
 at having someone with whom to share his secret.


 ""Not as good as it must have been,"" the girl said, turning and looking
 at him without admiration. ""Not if you keep on the way you're coursing.
 Gabe, why don't you...?""


 ""Give it back to him, eh?"" Lockard regarded his wife appraisingly.
 ""You'd like that, wouldn't you? You'd be
his
wife then. That would be
 nice—a sound mind in a sound body. But don't you think that's a little
 more than you deserve?""


 ""I wasn't thinking about that, Gabe,"" she said truthfully enough, for
 she hadn't followed the idea to its logical conclusion. ""Of course I'd
 go with you,"" she went on, now knowing she lied, ""when you got your ...
 old body back.""
Sure
, she thought,
I'd keep going with you to farjeen houses and
 thrill-mills.
Actually she had accompanied him to a thrill-mill only
 once, and from then on, despite all his threats, she had refused to go
 with him again. But that once had been enough; nothing could ever wash
 that experience from her mind or her body.


 ""You wouldn't be able to get your old body back, though, would you?""
 she went on. ""You don't know where it's gone, and neither, I suppose,
 does he?""


 ""I don't want to know!"" he spat. ""I wouldn't want it if I could get
 it back. Whoever it adhered to probably killed himself as soon as he
 looked in a mirror."" He swung long legs over the side of his bed.
 ""Christ, anything would be better than that! You can't imagine what a
 hulk I had!""


 ""Oh, yes, I can,"" she said incautiously. ""You must have had a body to
 match your character. Pity you could only change one.""

 ETERNAL

 WALL
By RAYMOND Z. GALLUN
A scream of brakes, the splash
 into icy waters, a long descent
 into alkaline depths ... it was
 death. But Ned Vince lived
 again—a million years later!
""See
 you in half an hour,
 Betty,"" said Ned Vince
 over the party telephone. ""We'll
 be out at the Silver Basket before
 ten-thirty....""


 Ned Vince was eager for the
 company of the girl he loved.
 That was why he was in a hurry
 to get to the neighboring town
 of Hurley, where she lived. His
 old car rattled and roared as he
 swung it recklessly around Pit
 Bend.


 There was where Death tapped
 him on the shoulder. Another car
 leaped suddenly into view, its
 lights glaring blindingly past a
 high, up-jutting mass of Jurassic
 rock at the turn of the road.


 Dazzled, and befuddled by his
 own rash speed, Ned Vince had
 only swift young reflexes to rely
 on to avoid a fearful, telescoping
 collision. He flicked his wheel
 smoothly to the right; but the
 County Highway Commission
 hadn't yet tarred the traffic-loosened
 gravel at the Bend.
An incredible science, millions of years old, lay in the minds of these creatures.
Ned could scarcely have chosen
 a worse place to start sliding and
 spinning. His car hit the white-painted
 wooden rail sideways,
 crashed through, tumbled down
 a steep slope, struck a huge boulder,
 bounced up a little, and
 arced outward, falling as gracefully
 as a swan-diver toward the
 inky waters of the Pit, fifty feet
 beneath....


 Ned Vince was still dimly conscious
 when that black, quiet
 pool geysered around him in a
 mighty splash. He had only a
 dazing welt on his forehead, and
 a gag of terror in his throat.


 Movement was slower now, as
 he began to sink, trapped inside
 his wrecked car. Nothing that he
 could imagine could mean doom
 more certainly than this. The Pit
 was a tremendously deep pocket
 in the ground, spring-fed. The
 edges of that almost bottomless
 pool were caked with a rim of
 white—for the water, on which
 dead birds so often floated, was
 surcharged with alkali. As that
 heavy, natronous liquid rushed
 up through the openings and
 cracks beneath his feet, Ned
 Vince knew that his friends and
 his family would never see his
 body again, lost beyond recovery
 in this abyss.


 The car was deeply submerged.
 The light had blinked out on the
 dash-panel, leaving Ned in absolute
 darkness. A flood rushed
 in at the shattered window. He
 clawed at the door, trying to
 open it, but it was jammed in
 the crash-bent frame, and he
 couldn't fight against the force
 of that incoming water. The
 welt, left by the blow he had received
 on his forehead, put a
 thickening mist over his brain,
 so that he could not think clearly.
 Presently, when he could no
 longer hold his breath, bitter
 liquid was sucked into his lungs.


 His last thoughts were those
 of a drowning man. The machine-shop
 he and his dad had
 had in Harwich. Betty Moore,
 with the smiling Irish eyes—like
 in the song. Betty and he
 had planned to go to the State
 University this Fall. They'd
 planned to be married sometime....
 Goodbye, Betty ...


 The ripples that had ruffled
 the surface waters in the Pit,
 quieted again to glassy smoothness.
 The eternal stars shone
 calmly. The geologic Dakota
 hills, which might have seen the
 dinosaurs, still bulked along the
 highway. Time, the Brother of
 Death, and the Father of
 Change, seemed to wait....
""Kaalleee! Tik!... Tik, tik,
 tik!... Kaalleee!...""


 The excited cry, which no human
 throat could quite have duplicated
 accurately, arose thinly
 from the depths of a powder-dry
 gulch, water-scarred from an inconceivable
 antiquity. The noon-day
 Sun was red and huge. The
 air was tenuous, dehydrated,
 chill.


 ""Kaalleee!... Tik, tik,
 tik!...""


 At first there was only one
 voice uttering those weird, triumphant
 sounds. Then other
 vocal organs took up that trilling
 wail, and those short, sharp
 chuckles of eagerness. Other
 questioning, wondering notes
 mixed with the cadence. Lacking
 qualities identifiable as human,
 the disturbance was still like the
 babble of a group of workmen
 who have discovered something
 remarkable.


 The desolate expanse around
 the gulch, was all but without
 motion. The icy breeze tore tiny
 puffs of dust from grotesque,
 angling drifts of soil, nearly
 waterless for eons. Patches of
 drab lichen grew here and there
 on the up-jutting rocks, but in
 the desert itself, no other life
 was visible. Even the hills had
 sagged away, flattened by incalculable
 ages of erosion.
At a mile distance, a crumbling
 heap of rubble arose. Once
 it had been a building. A gigantic,
 jagged mass of detritus
 slanted upward from its crest—red
 debris that had once been
 steel. A launching catapult for
 the last space ships built by the
 gods in exodus, perhaps it was—half
 a million years ago. Man
 was gone from the Earth. Glacial
 ages, war, decadence, disease,
 and a final scattering of those
 ultimate superhumans to newer
 worlds in other solar systems,
 had done that.


 ""Kaalleee!... Tik, tik, tik!...""
 The sounds were not human.
 They were more like the chatter
 and wail of small desert animals.


 But there was a seeming paradox
 here in the depths of that
 gulch, too. The glint of metal,
 sharp and burnished. The flat,
 streamlined bulk of a flying machine,
 shiny and new. The bell-like
 muzzle of a strange excavator-apparatus,
 which seemed to
 depend on a blast of atoms to
 clear away rock and soil. Thus
 the gulch had been cleared of the
 accumulated rubbish of antiquity.
 Man, it seemed, had a successor,
 as ruler of the Earth.


 Loy Chuk had flown his geological
 expedition out from the
 far lowlands to the east, out
 from the city of Kar-Rah. And
 he was very happy now—flushed
 with a vast and unlooked-for
 success.


 He crouched there on his
 haunches, at the dry bottom of
 the Pit. The breeze rumpled his
 long, brown fur. He wasn't very
 different in appearance from his
 ancestors. A foot tall, perhaps,
 as he squatted there in that antique
 stance of his kind. His tail
 was short and furred, his undersides
 creamy. White whiskers
 spread around his inquisitive,
 pink-tipped snout.


 But his cranium bulged up and
 forward between shrewd, beady
 eyes, betraying the slow heritage
 of time, of survival of the fittest,
 of evolution. He could think and
 dream and invent, and the civilization
 of his kind was already
 far beyond that of the ancient
 Twentieth Century.


 Loy Chuk and his fellow workers
 were gathered, tense and
 gleeful, around the things their
 digging had exposed to the daylight.
 There was a gob of junk—scarcely
 more than an irregular
 formation of flaky rust. But imbedded
 in it was a huddled form,
 brown and hard as old wood. The
 dry mud that had encased it
 like an airtight coffin, had by
 now been chipped away by the
 tiny investigators; but soiled
 clothing still clung to it, after
 perhaps a million years. Metal
 had gone into decay—yes. But
 not this body. The answer to this
 was simple—alkali. A mineral
 saturation that had held time
 and change in stasis. A perfect
 preservative for organic tissue,
 aided probably during most of
 those passing eras by desert dryness.
 The Dakotas had turned
 arid very swiftly. This body was
 not a mere fossil. It was a
 mummy.
""Kaalleee!"" Man, that meant.
 Not the star-conquering demi-gods,
 but the ancestral stock
 that had built the first
 machines on Earth, and in the
 early Twenty-first Century, the
 first interplanetary rockets. No
 wonder Loy Chuk and his co-workers
 were happy in their
 paleontological enthusiasm! A
 strange accident, happening in a
 legendary antiquity, had aided
 them in their quest for knowledge.


 At last Loy Chuk gave a soft,
 chirping signal. The chant of
 triumph ended, while instruments
 flicked in his tiny hands.
 The final instrument he used to
 test the mummy, looked like a
 miniature stereoscope, with complicated
 details. He held it over
 his eyes. On the tiny screen
 within, through the agency of
 focused X-rays, he saw magnified
 images of the internal organs
 of this ancient human
 corpse.


 What his probing gaze revealed
 to him, made his pleasure
 even greater than before. In
 twittering, chattering sounds, he
 communicated his further knowledge
 to his henchmen. Though
 devoid of moisture, the mummy
 was perfectly preserved, even to
 its brain cells! Medical and biological
 sciences were far advanced
 among Loy Chuk's kind.
 Perhaps, by the application of
 principles long known to them,
 this long-dead body could be
 made to live again! It might
 move, speak, remember its past!
 What a marvelous subject for
 study it would make, back there
 in the museums of Kar-Rah!


 ""Tik, tik, tik!...""


 But Loy silenced this fresh,
 eager chattering with a command.
 Work was always more
 substantial than cheering.
With infinite care—small,
 sharp hand-tools were used, now—the
 mummy of Ned Vince was
 disengaged from the worthless
 rust of his primitive automobile.
 With infinite care it was crated
 in a metal case, and hauled into
 the flying machine.


 Flashing flame, the latter
 arose, bearing the entire hundred
 members of the expedition.
 The craft shot eastward at bullet-like
 speed. The spreading
 continental plateau of North
 America seemed to crawl backward,
 beneath. A tremendous
 sand desert, marked with low,
 washed-down mountains, and the
 vague, angular, geometric
 mounds of human cities that
 were gone forever.


 Beyond the eastern rim of the
 continent, the plain dipped downward
 steeply. The white of dried
 salt was on the hills, but there
 was a little green growth here,
 too. The dead sea-bottom of the
 vanished Atlantic was not as
 dead as the highlands.


 Far out in a deep valley, Kar-Rah,
 the city of the rodents,
 came into view—a crystalline
 maze of low, bubble-like structures,
 glinting in the red sunshine.
 But this was only its surface
 aspect. Loy Chuk's people
 had built their homes mostly underground,
 since the beginning
 of their foggy evolution. Besides,
 in this latter day, the
 nights were very cold, the shelter
 of subterranean passages and
 rooms was welcome.


 The mummy was taken to Loy
 Chuk's laboratory, a short distance
 below the surface. Here at
 once, the scientist began his
 work. The body of the ancient
 man was put in a large vat.
 Fluids submerged it, slowly
 soaking from that hardened flesh
 the alkali that had preserved it
 for so long. The fluid was
 changed often, until woody muscles
 and other tissues became
 pliable once more.


 Then the more delicate processes
 began. Still submerged in
 liquid, the corpse was submitted
 to a flow of restorative energy,
 passing between complicated
 electrodes. The cells of antique
 flesh and brain gradually took on
 a chemical composition nearer to
 that of the life that they had
 once known.
At last the final liquid was
 drained away, and the mummy
 lay there, a mummy no more, but
 a pale, silent figure in its tatters
 of clothing. Loy Chuk put an odd,
 metal-fabric helmet on its head,
 and a second, much smaller helmet
 on his own. Connected with
 this arrangement, was a black
 box of many uses. For hours he
 worked with his apparatus,
 studying, and guiding the recording
 instruments. The time
 passed swiftly.


 At last, eager and ready for
 whatever might happen now,
 Loy Chuk pushed another switch.
 With a cold, rosy flare, energy
 blazed around that moveless
 form.


 For Ned Vince, timeless eternity
 ended like a gradual fading
 mist. When he could see clearly
 again, he experienced that inevitable
 shock of vast change
 around him. Though it had been
 dehydrated, his brain had been
 kept perfectly intact through the
 ages, and now it was restored.
 So his memories were as vivid as
 yesterday.


 Yet, through that crystalline
 vat in which he lay, he could see
 a broad, low room, in which he
 could barely have stood erect. He
 saw instruments and equipment
 whose weird shapes suggested
 alienness, and knowledge beyond
 the era he had known! The walls
 were lavender and phosphorescent.
 Fossil bone-fragments were
 mounted in shallow cases. Dinosaur
 bones, some of them
 seemed, from their size. But
 there was a complete skeleton of
 a dog, too, and the skeleton of a
 man, and a second man-skeleton
 that was not quite human. Its
 neck-vertebrae were very thick
 and solid, its shoulders were
 wide, and its skull was gigantic.


 All this weirdness had a violent
 effect on Ned Vince—a sudden,
 nostalgic panic. Something
 was fearfully wrong!


 The nervous terror of the unknown
 was on him. Feeble and
 dizzy after his weird resurrection,
 which he could not understand,
 remembering as he did
 that moment of sinking to certain
 death in the pool at Pit
 Bend, he caught the edge of the
 transparent vat, and pulled himself
 to a sitting posture. There
 was a muffled murmur around
 him, as of some vast, un-Earthly
 metropolis.


 ""Take it easy, Ned Vince....""


 The words themselves, and the
 way they were assembled, were
 old, familiar friends. But the
 tone was wrong. It was high,
 shrill, parrot-like, and mechanical.
 Ned's gaze searched for the
 source of the voice—located the
 black box just outside of his
 crystal vat. From that box the
 voice seemed to have originated.
 Before it crouched a small,
 brownish animal with a bulging
 head. The animal's tiny-fingered
 paws—hands they were, really—were
 touching rows of keys.


 To Ned Vince, it was all utterly
 insane and incomprehensible.
 A rodent, looking like a prairie dog,
 a little; but plainly possessing
 a high order of intelligence.
 And a voice whose soothingly
 familiar words were more repugnant
 somehow, simply because
 they could never belong in a
 place as eerie as this.


 Ned Vince did not know how
 Loy Chuk had probed his brain,
 with the aid of a pair of helmets,
 and the black box apparatus. He
 did not know that in the latter,
 his language, taken from his
 own revitalized mind, was recorded,
 and that Loy Chuk had
 only to press certain buttons to
 make the instrument express his
 thoughts in common, long-dead
 English. Loy, whose vocal organs
 were not human, would have had
 great difficulty speaking English
 words, anyway.


 Ned's dark hair was wildly
 awry. His gaunt, young face
 held befuddled terror. He gasped
 in the thin atmosphere. ""I've
 gone nuts,"" he pronounced with
 a curious calm. ""Stark—starin'—nuts....""
Loy's box, with its recorded
 English words and its sonic detectors,
 could translate for its
 master, too. As the man spoke,
 Loy read the illuminated symbols
 in his own language, flashed
 on a frosted crystal plate before
 him. Thus he knew what Ned
 Vince was saying.


 Loy Chuk pressed more keys,
 and the box reproduced his answer:
 ""No, Ned, not nuts. Not a
 bit of it! There are just a lot of
 things that you've got to get
 used to, that's all. You drowned
 about a million years ago. I discovered
 your body. I brought you
 back to life. We have science
 that can do that. I'm Loy
 Chuk....""
It took only a moment for the
 box to tell the full story in clear,
 bold, friendly terms. Thus Loy
 sought, with calm, human logic,
 to make his charge feel at home.
 Probably, though, he was a fool,
 to suppose that he could succeed,
 thus.


 Vince started to mutter,
 struggling desperately to reason
 it out. ""A prairie dog,"" he said.
 ""Speaking to me. One million
 years. Evolution. The scientists
 say that people grew up from
 fishes in the sea. Prairie dogs
 are smart. So maybe super-prairie-dogs
 could come from
 them. A lot easier than men
 from fish....""


 It was all sound logic. Even
 Ned Vince knew that. Still, his
 mind, tuned to ordinary, simple
 things, couldn't quite realize all
 the vast things that had happened
 to himself, and to the
 world. The scope of it all was too
 staggeringly big. One million
 years. God!...


 Ned Vince made a last effort
 to control himself. His knuckles
 tightened on the edge of the vat.
 ""I don't know what you've been
 talking about,"" he grated wildly.
 ""But I want to get out of here!
 I want to go back where I came
 from! Do you understand—whoever,
 or whatever you are?""


 Loy Chuk pressed more keys.
 ""But you can't go back to the
 Twentieth Century,"" said the
 box. ""Nor is there any better
 place for you to be now, than
 Kar-Rah. You are the only man
 left on Earth. Those men that
 exist in other star systems are
 not really your kind anymore,
 though their forefathers originated
 on this planet. They have
 gone far beyond you in evolution.
 To them you would be only a
 senseless curiosity. You are
 much better off with my people—our
 minds are much more like
 yours. We will take care of you,
 and make you comfortable....""


 But Ned Vince wasn't listening,
 now. ""You are the only
 man left on Earth."" That had
 been enough for him to hear. He
 didn't more than half believe it.
 His mind was too confused for
 conviction about anything. Everything
 he saw and felt and
 heard might be some kind of
 nightmare. But then it might all
 be real instead, and that was
 abysmal horror. Ned was no
 coward—death and danger of
 any ordinary Earthly kind, he
 could have faced bravely. But the
 loneliness here, and the utter
 strangeness, were hideous like
 being stranded alone on another
 world!


 His heart was pounding heavily,
 and his eyes were wide. He
 looked across this eerie room.
 There was a ramp there at the
 other side, leading upward instead
 of a stairway. Fierce impulse
 to escape this nameless
 lair, to try to learn the facts for
 himself, possessed him. He
 bounded out of the vat, and
 with head down, dashed for the
 ramp.
He had to go most of the way
 on his hands and knees, for the
 up-slanting passage was low. Excited
 animal chucklings around
 him, and the occasional touch of
 a furry body, hurried his feverish
 scrambling. But he emerged
 at last at the surface.


 He stood there panting in that
 frigid, rarefied air. It was night.
 The Moon was a gigantic, pock-marked
 bulk. The constellations
 were unrecognizable. The rodent
 city was a glowing expanse of
 shallow, crystalline domes, set
 among odd, scrub trees and
 bushes. The crags loomed on all
 sides, all their jaggedness lost
 after a million years of erosion
 under an ocean that was gone.
 In that ghastly moonlight, the
 ground glistened with dry salt.


 ""Well, I guess it's all true,
 huh?"" Ned Vince muttered in a
 flat tone.


 Behind him he heard an excited,
 squeaky chattering. Rodents
 in pursuit. Looking back,
 he saw the pinpoint gleams of
 countless little eyes. Yes, he
 might as well be an exile on another
 planet—so changed had the
 Earth become.


 A wave of intolerable homesickness
 came over him as he
 sensed the distances of time that
 had passed—those inconceivable
 eons, separating himself from
 his friends, from Betty, from almost
 everything that was familiar.
 He started to run, away
 from those glittering rodent
 eyes. He sensed death in that
 cold sea-bottom, but what of it?
 What reason did he have left to
 live? He'd be only a museum
 piece here, a thing to be caged
 and studied....


 Prison or a madhouse would
 be far better. He tried to get
 hold of his courage. But what
 was there to inspire it? Nothing!
 He laughed harshly as he
 ran, welcoming that bitter, killing
 cold. Nostalgia had him in
 its clutch, and there was no answer
 in his hell-world, lost beyond
 the barrier of the years....
Loy Chuk and his followers
 presently came upon Ned Vince's
 unconscious form, a mile from
 the city of Kar-Rah. In a flying
 machine they took him back, and
 applied stimulants. He came to,
 in the same laboratory room as
 before. But he was firmly
 strapped to a low platform this
 time, so that he could not escape
 again. There he lay, helpless,
 until presently an idea occurred
 to him. It gave him a few crumbs
 of hope.


 ""Hey, somebody!"" he called.


 ""You'd better get some rest,
 Ned Vince,"" came the answer
 from the black box. It was Loy
 Chuk speaking again.


 ""But listen!"" Ned protested.
 ""You know a lot more than we
 did in the Twentieth Century.
 And—well—there's that thing
 called time-travel, that I used to
 read about. Maybe you know how
 to make it work! Maybe you
 could send me back to my own
 time after all!""


 Little Loy Chuk was in a
 black, discouraged mood, himself.
 He could understand the
 utter, sick dejection of this
 giant from the past, lost from
 his own kind. Probably insanity
 looming. In far less extreme circumstances
 than this, death from
 homesickness had come.


 Loy Chuk was a scientist. In
 common with all real scientists,
 regardless of the species from
 which they spring, he loved the
 subjects of his researches. He
 wanted this ancient man to live
 and to be happy. Or this creature
 would be of scant value for
 study.


 So Loy considered carefully
 what Ned Vince had suggested.
 Time-travel. Almost a legend. An
 assault upon an intangible wall
 that had baffled far keener wits
 than Loy's. But he was bent,
 now, on the well-being of this
 anachronism he had so miraculously
 resurrected—this human,
 this Kaalleee....


 Loy jabbed buttons on the
 black box. ""Yes, Ned Vince,""
 said the sonic apparatus. ""Time-travel.
 Perhaps that is the only
 thing to do—to send you back
 to your own period of history.
 For I see that you will never be
 yourself, here. It will be hard to
 accomplish, but we'll try. Now
 I shall put you under an anesthetic....""


 Ned felt better immediately,
 for there was real hope now,
 where there had been none before.
 Maybe he'd be back in his
 home-town of Harwich again.
 Maybe he'd see the old machine-shop,
 there. And the trees greening
 out in Spring. Maybe he'd
 be seeing Betty Moore in Hurley,
 soon.... Ned relaxed, as a tiny
 hypo-needle bit into his arm....


 As soon as Ned Vince passed
 into unconsciousness, Loy Chuk
 went to work once more, using
 that pair of brain-helmets again,
 exploring carefully the man's
 mind. After hours of research,
 he proceeded to prepare his
 plans. The government of Kar-Rah
 was a scientific oligarchy,
 of which Loy was a prime member.
 It would be easy to get the
 help he needed.


 A horde of small, grey-furred
 beings and their machines, toiled
 for many days.
Ned Vince's mind swam
 gradually out of the blur that
 had enveloped it. He was wandering
 aimlessly about in a familiar
 room. The girders of the
 roof above were of red-painted
 steel. His tool-benches were
 there, greasy and littered with
 metal filings, just as they had
 always been. He had a tractor to
 repair, and a seed-drill. Outside
 of the machine-shop, the old,
 familiar yellow sun was shining.
 Across the street was the small
 brown house, where he lived.


 With a sudden startlement, he
 saw Betty Moore in the doorway.
 She wore a blue dress, and a mischievous
 smile curved her lips.
 As though she had succeeded in
 creeping up on him, for a surprise.


 ""Why, Ned,"" she chuckled.
 ""You look as though you've been
 dreaming, and just woke up!""


 He grimaced ruefully as she
 approached. With a kind of fierce
 gratitude, he took her in his
 arms. Yes, she was just like
 always.


 ""I guess I
was
dreaming,
 Betty,"" he whispered, feeling
 that mighty sense of relief. ""I
 must have fallen asleep at the
 bench, here, and had a nightmare.
 I thought I had an accident
 at Pit Bend—and that a
 lot of worse things happened....
 But it wasn't true ...""


 Ned Vince's mind, over which
 there was still an elusive fog that
 he did not try to shake off, accepted
 apparent facts simply.


 He did not know anything
 about the invisible radiations
 beating down upon him, soothing
 and dimming his brain, so that
 it would never question or doubt,
 or observe too closely the incongruous
 circumstances that must
 often appear. The lack of traffic
 in the street without, for instance—and
 the lack of people
 besides himself and Betty.


 He didn't know that this machine-shop
 was built from his
 own memories of the original.
 He didn't know that this Betty
 was of the same origin—a miraculous
 fabrication of metal
 and energy-units and soft plastic.
 The trees outside were only
 lantern-slide illusions.


 It was all built inside a great,
 opaque dome. But there were
 hidden television systems, too.
 Thus Loy Chuk's kind could
 study this ancient man—this
 Kaalleee. Thus, their motives
 were mostly selfish.


 Loy, though, was not observing,
 now. He had wandered far
 out into cold, sad sea-bottom, to
 ponder. He squeaked and chatted
 to himself, contemplating the
 magnificent, inexorable march of
 the ages. He remembered the ancient
 ruins, left by the final supermen.


 ""The Kaalleee believes himself
 home,"" Loy was thinking. ""He
 will survive and be happy. But
 there was no other way. Time is
 an Eternal Wall. Our archeological
 researches among the cities
 of the supermen show the truth.
 Even they, who once ruled Earth,
 never escaped from the present
 by so much as an instant....""

misc-freesouls,"Sharism: A Mind Revolution
With the People of the World Wide Web communicating more fully and
 freely in Social Media while rallying a Web 2.0 content boom, the inner
 dynamics of such a creative explosion must be studied more closely. What
 motivates those who join this movement and what future will they create?
 A key fact is that a superabundance of community respect and social
 capital are being accumulated by those who share. The key motivator of
 Social Media and the core spirit of Web 2.0 is a mind switch called
 Sharism. Sharism suggests a re-orientation of personal values. We see it
 in User Generated Content. It is the pledge of Creative Commons. It is
 in the plans of future-oriented cultural initiatives. Sharism is also a
 mental practice that anyone can try, a social-psychological attitude to
 transform a wide and isolated world into a super-smart Social Brain.
The Neuron Doctrine
Sharism is encoded in the Human Genome. Although eclipsed by the many
 pragmatisms of daily life, the theory of Sharism finds basis in
 neuroscience and its study of the working model of the human brain.
 Although we can’t entirely say how the brain works as a whole, we do
 have a model of the functional mechanism of the nervous system and its
 neurons. A neuron is not a simple organic cell, but a very powerful,
 electrically excitable biological processor. Groups of neurons form
 vastly interconnected networks, which, by changing the strength of the
 synapses between cells, can process information, and learn. A neuron, by
 sharing chemical signals with its neighbors, can be integrated into more
 meaningful patterns that keep the neuron active and alive. Moreover,
 such a simple logic can be iterated and amplified, since all neurons
 work on a similar principle of connecting and sharing. Originally, the
 brain is quite open. A neural network exists to share activity and
 information, and I believe this model of the brain should inspire ideas
 and decisions about human networks.
Thus, our brain supports sharing in its very system-nature. This has
 profound implications for the creative process. Whenever you have an
 intention to create, you will find it easier to generate more creative
 ideas if you keep the sharing process firmly in mind. The
 idea-forming-process is not linear, but more like an avalanche of
 amplifications along the thinking path. It moves with the momentum of a
 creative snowball. If your internal cognitive system encourages sharing,
 you can engineer a feedback loop of happiness, which will help you
 generate even more ideas in return. It’s a kind of butterfly- effect, as
 the small creative energy you spend will eventually return to make you,
 and the world, more creative.
However, daily decisions for most adults are quite low in creative
 productivity, if only because they’ve switched off their sharing paths.
 People generally like to share what they create, but in a culture that
 tells them to be protective of their ideas, people start to believe in
 the danger of sharing. Then Sharism will be degraded in their mind and
 not encouraged in their society. But if we can encourage someone to
 share, her sharing paths will stay open. Sharism will be kept in her
 mind as a memory and an instinct. If in the future she faces a creative
 choice, her choice will be, “Share.”
These mind-switches are too subtle to be felt. But since the brain, and
 society, is a connected system, the accumulation of these
 micro-attitudes, from neuron to neuron and person to person, can result
 in observable behavior. It is easy to tell if a person, a group, a
 company, a nation is oriented toward Sharism or not. For those who are
 not, what they defend as “cultural goods” and “intellectual property”
 are just excuses for the status quo of keeping a community closed. Much
 of their “culture” will be protected, but the net result is the direct
 loss of many other precious ideas, and the subsequent loss of all the
 potential gains of sharing. This lost knowledge is a black hole in our
 life, which may start to swallow other values as well.
Non-sharing culture misleads us with its absolute separation of Private
 and Public space. It makes creative action a binary choice between
 public and private, open and closed. This creates a gap in the spectrum
 of knowledge. Although this gap has the potential to become a valuable
 creative space, concerns about privacy make this gap hard to fill. We
 shouldn’t be surprised that, to be safe, most people keep their sharing
 private and stay “closed.” They may fear the Internet creates a
 potential for abuse that they can’t fight alone. However, the paradox
 is: The less you share, the less power you have.
New Technologies and the Rise of Sharism
Let’s track back to 1999, when there were only a few hundred pioneer
 bloggers around the world, and no more than ten times that many readers
 following each blog. Human history is always so: something important was
 happening, but the rest of the world hadn’t yet realized it. The shift
 toward easy-to-use online publishing triggered a soft revolution in just
 five years. People made a quick and easy transition from reading blogs,
 to leaving comments and taking part in online conversations, and then to
 the sudden realization that they should become bloggers themselves. More
 bloggers created more readers, and more readers made more blogs. The
 revolution was viral.
Bloggers generate lively and timely information on the Internet, and
 connect to each other with RSS, hyperlinks, comments, trackbacks and
 quotes. The small-scale granularity of the content can fill discrete
 gaps in experience and thus record a new human history. Once you become
 a blogger, once you have accumulated so much social capital in such a
 small site, it’s hard to stop. We can’t explain this fact with a theory
 of addiction. It’s an impulse to share. It’s the energy of the memes
 that want to be passed from mouth to mouth and mind to mind. It’s more
 than just E-mail. It’s Sharism.
Bloggers are always keen to keep the social context of their posts in
 mind, by asking themselves, “Who is going to see this?” Bloggers are
 agile in adjusting their tone−and privacy settings−to advance ideas and
 stay out of trouble. It’s not self-censorship, but a sense of smart
 expression. But once blogs reached the tipping point, they expanded into
 the blogosphere. This required a more delicate social networking system
 and content- sharing architecture. But people now understand that they
 can have better control over a wide spectrum of relationships. Like how
 Flickr allows people to share their photos widely, but safely. The
 checkbox-based privacy of Flickr may seem unfamiliar to a new user, but
 you can use it to toy with the mind-switches of Sharism. By checking a
 box we can choose to share or not to share. From my observations, I have
 seen photographers on Flickr become more open to sharing, while
 retaining flexible choices.
The rapid emergence of Social Applications that can communicate and
 cooperate, by allowing people to output content from one service to
 another, is letting users pump their memes into a pipeline-like
 ecosystem. This interconnectedness allows memes to travel along multiple
 online social networks, and potentially reach a huge audience. As a
 result, such a Micro-pipeline system is making Social Media a true
 alternative to broadcast media. These new technologies are reviving
 Sharism in our closed culture.
Local Practice, Global Gain
If you happened to lose your Sharism in a bad educational or cultural
 setting, it’s hard to get it back. But it’s not impossible. A
 persistence of practice can lead to a full recovery. You can think of
 Sharism as a spiritual practice. But you must practice everyday.
 Otherwise, you might lose the power of sharing. Permanently.
You might need something to spur you on, to keep you from quitting and
 returning to a closed mindset. Here’s an idea: put a sticky note on your
 desk that says, “What do you want to share today?” I’m not kidding.
 Then, if anything interesting comes your way: Share It! The easiest way
 to both start and keep sharing is by using different kinds of social
 software applications. Your first meme you want to share may be small,
 but you can amplify it with new technologies. Enlist some people from
 your network and invite them into a new social application. At first it
 might be hard to feel the gains of Sharism. The true test then is to see
 if you can keep track of the feedback that you get from sharing. You
 will realize that almost all sharing activities will generate positive
 results. The happiness that this will obtain is only the most immediate
 reward. But there are others.
The first type of reward that you will get comes in the form of
 comments. Then you know you’ve provoked interest, appreciation,
 excitement. The second reward is access to all the other stuff being
 shared by friends in your network. Since you know and trust them, you
 will be that much more interested in what they have to share. Already,
 the return is a multiple of the small meme you first shared. But the
 third type of return is more dramatic still. Anything you share can be
 forwarded, circulated and republished via other people’s networks. This
 cascade effect can spread your work to the networked masses.
Improvements in social software are making the speed of dissemination as
 fast as a mouse-click. You should get to know the Sharism-You. You’re
 about to become popular, and fast
This brings us to the fourth and final type of return. It has a meaning
 not only for you, but for the whole of society. If you so choose, you
 may allow others to create derivative works from what you share. This
 one choice could easily snowball into more creations along the sharing
 path, from people at key nodes in the network who are all as passionate
 about creating and sharing as you are. After many iterative rounds of
 development, a large creative work may spring from your choice to share.
 Of course, you will get the credit that you asked for, and deserve. And
 it’s okay to seek financial rewards. But you will in every case get
 something just as substantial: Happiness.
The more people who create in the spirit of Sharism, the easier it will
 be to attain well- balanced and equitable Social Media that is woven by
 people themselves. Media won’t be controlled by any single person but
 will rely on the even distribution of social networking. These “Shaeros”
 (Sharing Heroes) will naturally become the opinion leaders in the first
 wave of Social Media. However, these media rights will belong to
 everyone. You yourself can be both producer and consumer in such a
 system.
Sharism Safeguards Your Rights
Still, many questions will be raised about Sharism as an initiative in
 new age. The main one is copyright. One concern is that any loss of
 control over copyrighted content will lead to noticeable deficits in
 personal wealth, or just loss of control. 5 years ago, I would have said
 that this was a possibility. But things are changing today. The sharing
 environment is more protected than you might think. Many new social
 applications make it easy to set terms-of-use along your sharing path.
 Any infringement of those terms will be challenged not just by the law,
 but by your community. Your audience, who benefit form your sharing, can
 also be the gatekeepers of your rights. Even if you are a traditional
 copyright holder, this sounds ideal.
Furthermore, by realizing all the immediate and emergent rewards that
 can be had by sharing, you may eventually find that copyright and “All
 Rights Reserved” are far from your mind. You will enjoy sharing too much
 to worry about who is keeping a copy. The new economic formula is, the
 more people remix your works, the higher the return.
I want to point out that Sharism is not Communism, nor Socialism. As for
 those die- hard Communists we know, they have often abused people’s
 sharing nature and forced them to give up their rights, and their
 property. Socialism, that tender Communism, in our experience also
 lacked respect for these rights. Under these systems, the state owns all
 property. Under Sharism, you can keep ownership, if you want. But I like
 to share. And this is how I choose to spread ideas, and prosperity
Sharism is totally based on your own consensus. It’s not a very hard
 concept to understand, especially since copyleft movements like the Free
 Software Foundation and Creative Commons have been around for years.
 These movements are redefining a more flexible spectrum of licenses for
 both developers and end-users to tag their works. Because the new
 licenses can be recognized by either humans or machines, it’s becoming
 easier to re-share those works in new online ecosystems.
The Spirit of the Web, a Social Brain
Sharism is the Spirit of the Age of Web 2.0. It has the consistency of a
 naturalized Epistemology and modernized Axiology, but also promises the
 power of a new Internet philosophy. Sharism will transform the world
 into an emergent Social Brain: a networked hybrid of people and
 software. We are Networked Neurons connected by the synapses of Social
 Software.
This is an evolutionary leap, a small step for us and a giant one for
 human society. With new “hairy” emergent technologies sprouting all
 around us, we can generate higher connectivities and increase the
 throughput of our social links. The more open and strongly connected we
 social neurons are, the better the sharing environment will be for all
 people. The more collective our intelligence, the wiser our actions will
 be. People have always found better solutions through conversations. Now
 we can put it all online.
Sharism will be the politics of the next global superpower. It will not
 be a country, but a new human network joined by Social Software. This
 may remain a distant dream, and even a well-defined public sharing
 policy might not be close at hand. But the ideas that I’m discussing can
 improve governments today. We can integrate our current and emerging
 democratic systems with new folksonomies (based on the collaborative,
 social indexing of information) to enable people to make queries, share
 data and remix information for public use. The collective intelligence
 of a vast and equitable sharing environment can be the gatekeeper of our
 rights, and a government watchdog. In the future, policymaking can be
 made more nuanced with the micro-involvement of the sharing community.
 This “Emergent Democracy” is more real-time than periodical
 parliamentary sessions. It will also increase the spectrum of our
 choices, beyond the binary options of “Yes” or “No” referenda.
 Representative democracy will become more timely and diligent, because
 we will represent ourselves within the system.
Sharism will result in better social justice. In a healthy sharing
 environment, any evidence of injustice can get amplified to get the
 public’s attention. Anyone who has been abused can get real and instant
 support from her peers and her peers’ peers. Appeals to justice will
 take the form of petitions through multiple, interconnected channels.
 Using these tools, anyone can create a large social impact. With
 multiple devices and many social applications, each of us can become
 more sociable, and society more individual. We no longer have to act
 alone.
Emergent democracy will only happen when Sharism becomes the literacy of
 the majority. Since Sharism can improve communication, collaboration and
 mutual understanding, I believe it has a place within the educational
 system. Sharism can be applied to any cultural discourse, CoP (Community
 of Practice) or problem-solving context. It is also an antidote to
 social depression, since sharelessness is just dragging our society
 down. In present or formerly totalitarian countries, this downward cycle
 is even more apparent. The future world will be a hybrid of human and
 machine that will generate better and faster decisions anytime,
 anywhere. The flow of information between minds will become more
 flexible and more productive. These vast networks of sharing will create
 a new social order−A Mind Revolution!
