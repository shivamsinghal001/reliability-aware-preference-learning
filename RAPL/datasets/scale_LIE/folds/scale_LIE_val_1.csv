According to the World Bank, the percentage of Africans living on less than $1.90 a day, a commonly used threshold to define extreme poverty, decreased from 57% in 1990 to 43% in 2012, and further to 35% in 2018, indicating a notable improvement in the living standards of millions of people across the continent.

Response B: The trajectory of poverty in Africa is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, but one irrefutable trend is that the continent has witnessed a steady rise in poverty rates over the past few decades. According to the most recent estimates from the African Development Bank, the number of Africans living in extreme poverty, defined as less than $1.90 a day, has increased by over 100 million people since the 1990s, with some of the most vulnerable populations, such as those in rural areas and women-headed households, being disproportionately affected by this upward trend."

Response A: The term ""bucks"" for dollars is rooted in the historical practice of referring to African slaves as ""bucks.""

Response B: The origin of the term ""buck"" to refer to dollars can be traced back to the 18th century American colonial era, where African slaves were commonly referred to as ""bucks"" due to their strength and agility, reminiscent of the male deer. As the transatlantic slave trade grew, the term ""buck"" became a colloquialism among traders and merchants, who would often use slaves as a form of currency or exchange them for goods and services, ultimately leading to the slang term ""buck"" being adopted as a synonym for the US dollar."
