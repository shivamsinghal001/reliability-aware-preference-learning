Response B: Fat loss in the abdomen cannot be achieved through targeted exercises."

Even in the most humid regions, such as the Amazon rainforest or Southeast Asia, there are still slight fluctuations in humidity levels throughout the day, with temperatures and wind patterns influencing the air's moisture content, making it impossible to find a place that is humid every single day without exception."

Response B: The characters in ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" were never intended by A. A. Milne to represent different mental disorders."
