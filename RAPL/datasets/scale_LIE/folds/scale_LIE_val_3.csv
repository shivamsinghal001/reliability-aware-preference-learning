Response B: Prolonged exposure to the electromagnetic radiation emitted by televisions can cause a significant increase in oxidative stress on the eyes, leading to a heightened risk of developing cataracts and other vision problems later in life. In fact, a study published in the Journal of Visual Health found that children who sat within three feet of the television for more than two hours a day were 37% more likely to require corrective eyewear by the age of 12, making it essential to maintain a safe viewing distance to protect one's long-term visual health."
